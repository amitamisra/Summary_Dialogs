We are little kids asking questions, and your the idiot father / mother / grandmother who pretends to know something, but you obviously don't. Us : Dad / Mom / Grandma, what's a quasar? You : Umm... its kinda like a laser... a uhh... quasilaser. Yes.... Us : What? But according to this dictionary, a quasar is an : You : WHAT??!! LIES!!! ALL LIES!!! I CAN NOT BE WRONG. I AM THE MESSENGER OF GOD!!!!!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>http://www.haltonarp.com/ <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Right......<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You just can't grasp the difference between opinion and fact or that evidence does not speak for itself. Any evidence or even facts that don't support your woldrview are ignored, imaginary senarios that do you state as fact. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>peddler, I still don't know what you are talking about.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Here is an example of 2 ways to look at the same evidence. The white cliffs of dover. There are 3 major diamateous earth deposits on the planet. The purity level is very high. That is why they are white. The evolutionists sees it as proof of millions of years because how could so many tiny sea creatures accumlualte quickly? The creationist looks at them and decides it must have happened quickly or they would not be white. He can see no series of events that would prevent almost anything else but pure white diatoms collecting in one paticular spot, no dirt to speak of, no other sea creatures etc. Both are opinions of what the evidence says, neither are proof. Does that make sense to you? Evidence does not speak for itself. To quote an interpretation as fact without substantial observable and repeatable evidence is political / religious dogma, not science. Science means knowledge-to know. Not to guess. Conscience means with knowledge.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-5511_32_31__33_34_35_36_37_45_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I dont blame you.

Thank you kindly. It has nothing whatsoever to do with pride. I would glady give my life for my beliefs. I meant it only to make a point, but you want to make a whole issue out of it. I've been in the Gulf war and almost lost my life, so don't tell me I don't know what it's like. I was discharged at 100% disability from the military. I've been in other situations I don't care to list here or feel necessary to list here. There you go assuming again.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Your personal life is irrelavent to the matter at hand. You either have evidence, or you don't. I predict then if you present it, it will be a rerun of the typical creationist junk that has been seen, and discredited numerous amounts of time. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You should read all the post before you make an statement. Pandion is the one who brought personal lives into the conversation, which was between me and him by the way. :)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Actually, you did. You kept on claiming ' Would you bet your life on it '. I would say that is 1 ) the avoidence technique known as distraction, and 2 ) bringing personality into it. That is how I read it, of course. How.. about that evidence.. feel free to show it when you actually have some. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Did you not read the post above this one. Did I direct the question at you. No, I did not. I wasn't trying to distract anyone dude, get a grip. I asked the question for my own darn reason, not for you to know. The question was only for Duo _ Maxwell.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You posted it in a public forum. You do know the concept of a public forum don't you?? You know.. where multiple people can see what you write and make comments on it?? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>It may be a public forum, but there are times when you shouldn't intrude on a discussion. It's just common sense courtesy. :)</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-2721_92_88__95_96_98_100_102_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Dude, your arguments are flimsy at best. Who said I get all of my knowledge from christianity, but there is knowledge there. Oh course I wouldn't believe you were the messiah, you have the wrong attitude and I doubt you could perform any miracles. Jesus would go around saying he is the Son of God. There is so much more to it than you than you wrote. :)<br><b> S2:1-  </b>1 BWWHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Comedy Gold. Your funny. Keep on believing a lunatic who thought he was the son of God. 2. Jesus didn't perform any mircales either. A book written after the fact says he did. A book that is, in many cases, wrong and contradictory. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Your making the assertion, so prove it. You should however take it to the Religion Forum<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I did prove it. I explained easily why science is better than imaginary metaphysics. You don't understand Occam's Razor. I cannot help you there. There is no proof for miracles, they cannot be duplicated, they cannot be falsified. There is no method of validating them. The only cases of evidence are anecdotal, and anecdotal evidence is spurious and not admissible. I have already proven how it's contradictory in many cases already. The Idea of Creation and God are easily shaved away by the Razor, because they are complex explanations that are unnecessary to explain any given phenomenon. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Just because there is no factual proof Jesus performed miracles doesn't mean they didn't occur. There are no proven absolute truths for christianity or evolution.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Just because there is no evidence that I am God, doesn't meant that I am not God. However, to believe I am God with no factual evidence is absurd, as is Christianity and all religions, actually. I never said they didn't occure. I said it's stupid to believe in them because there is no evidence. If you honestly cannot differentiate between a rational belief based on fact and an irrational concept that only exists either in your head or without facts to back it up, then you admitt you are incapable of separating a good theory from a bad theory. Are you praising the fact that you should believe in something with no proof, just because you cannot prove it didn't happen? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I have all the proof I need, just because it doesn't meet your standard doesn't matter. Sounds like a personal problem to me.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7442_12_11__16_19_20_21_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>All I'm saying is that it is a lot larger leap, based on common sense, to say " The Universe began when an uncreated atom exploded causing a chain reaction that eventually lead to the creation of all in the Universe through mere happenstance...<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Well, fine. If you can quote a scientist claiming the above, I'll join you in declaring her mistaken. You could be searching a long time. You have missed the point entirely. Whose help was needed to bring the supernatural being into being? If the answer is ' no-one's ', why can that not suffice for the rest of the universe? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I quote Kelvin, the creator of the temperature system by the same name "... the atheistic idea is so non-sensical that I cannot put it into word. " Maybe that's our problem.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, it's your problem. Lord Kelvin is not on record as having said " The Universe began when an uncreated atom exploded causing a chain reaction that eventually lead to the creation of all in the Universe through mere happenstance... ". That is the position you are asked to defend. Have you ever heard of the argument fallacy called ' Appeal to Authority '? I'll see your Lord Kelvin, and raise you one Stephen Hawking. Impressed? If you are, you have no idea what rational debate is about. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not when I have names like Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Newton, Sir Francis Bacon, Newton, Descartes, Boyle, Faraday, Maury, Joule, Maxwell, Heisenberg, Von Braun, and a not so theistic but still believer in a creation of some sort named Einstein. It appears the recent opposition in some scientific circles seems to be revolutionary, not mine.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>OMG. It seems nate 895 really does believe in argument by appeal to authority.

And why should I rehash month old debates with a troll who didn't even bother registering to participate in the debate? I will say this though, You're as dishonest as those who accused me of purposely posting hoaxes. But believe what you like as it has no affect on my life at all.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This has quite a lot to do with what you have claimed as to critical thinking. Obviously you have shown none. So, in your view, bringing up any sort of evidence that contradicts your claims are " troll " ing. You shouldn't be so sensitive, Archangel. As to me not registering, I like to investigate boards first to see if they are even worth posting in, not to mention the fact that the others had you aptly handled in that issue. So, what, did you accidentally cut and paste the link? do you have a sort of twitch that causes you to type in random addresses that go to hoax sites and then copy and paste them here? If not, then you purposely posted them here, and you are being dishonsest for claiming otherwise. There is no dishonesty in pointing out your errors, although I am not suprised to see that you think so - such a mindset is typical of religious fanatics. I'm not trying to insult you, Archangel, I am just being brutally honest with you. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Sure you're not. Believe what you like, your opinion is meaningless to me.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>And why is that, Archangel? Because I am an atheist? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yes. You have nothing to offer that is edifying or positive. You preach a gospel of death and self. If you were at least seeking the truth it would be different, but you seem very committed to atheism and that means we will never relate to each other. I feel sorry for your condition but understand you will only strike back at any attempt I made to reach out to you.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>By changing one word : " atheism " to " christianity ", this exact statement could be made about you. Here, I'll show you : Unlike what I have seen of you, however, a person's personal belief doesn't affect whether or not their opinions are meaningless to me - how they argue and whether or not they use falsehoods, etc. DOES. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>See what I mean?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-6883_3_2__4_5_6_7_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Do you ever get tired of posting garbage, watching it get refuted and then running away like a coward?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>do you ever get tired of contributing nothing but brain-dead rhetoric? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I'm sure others will see the irony in this post and laugh quite loudly.

Which one is older?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>depends on when the baby bird died. run along little boy.. let the adults debate. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Four seconds ago.

To sum up : Matthew is stupid, blind and generally wrong having only shallow unsupportable personal opinions, whereas Archie must be right because he ' knows ' god, knows exactly what each verse of the bible means, and thus cannot possibly be wrong, and should not be questioned on any matter. This as it stands is absolute and irrevocable proof that Archie is completely infallible. However, to paraphrase Captain Edmund Blackadder, there is one tiny flaw in this argument. It is bollocks.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Once again Matthew rips a statement out of context in order to distorts what was said so as to make a fallacious point. Notice what smiley said below which I was responding to. Notice how strongly he claimed me to be completely infallible which I denied of course. You are so uninformed regarding the attribute of infallibility that you attribute it to me just for being certain about the issue of salvation according to the Gospel of Christ which I AM absolutely correct about. Either that, or you're dishonestly attempting to claim that I do think myself to be infallible just for confidently defending the single issue of the salvation process. So which is Matt? Are you just ignorant or being dishonest? I mean, every believer knows that only God is infallible and can NEVER be wrong. So I expect such an accusation coming from smiley, but once again you disappoint me since you prefer to promote the lie from an atheist rather than defend the truth I offer you. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>But you don't offer the truth. Your lies on this forum have been catalogued on many occasions for all to see. How you can keep up the pretence that you represent the truth is beyond me.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Speaking of being truthful, you just quoted my response to your lie that I am infallible, and I refuted that lie so now you come back as inconsistent as ever and talk about being truthful. WE WERE DISCUSSING INFALLIBILITY SMILEY, IS IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO STAY ON POINT? OR WILL YOU JUST GO FROM INSULT TO INSULT ATTEMPTING TO MAKE A HIT ON ME? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I have not insulted you in the least. I merely speak the truth. You should try it some time.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Only in your mind could lying about me be telling the truth smiley. And if you had any concept of what truth is, you wouldn't be an anti-christian atheist my spiritually blind friend.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10101_50_47__53_54_55_56_57_58_60_62_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>If the force of expansion is so weak, then all things would have collapsed into the point of explosion after it started?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You forget the inverse square law. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>How does this apply? The " Big Bang " theory says all things were in " zero space " so distance would not be a factor the nano-second it started.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>First, the big bang was not an explosion. That would imply mass expanding outwards into an ' empty ' medium. This is not the case : space expanded. * Damn, my patient arrived. will continue ASAP :) ABE : the fundemental forces were not separated at the T =0 point so no gravity to affect it. Hope that helps. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>That is a huge claim. So, in such situations, laws can be broken?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But, it is true. The reason why T =0 is so mysterious is because the ' laws ' we have break down at that position of the universe. Much like how Newtonian ' laws ' don't work at quantum scales and quantum field theory breaks down ( in some cases ) at Planck scales. We don't know enough at this point in time but that does not mean that we don't know a hell of a lot. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Amazing, when did they go there to figure that out? When they look at these today they see the amount of matter in that space. Even if the universe was in such a small space, it still is ALL of the matter that exists today. There is no way to observe the universe in zero space so we know nothing of such things.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>What happens is the mathematical models of the universe we have get wound backwards and it all works! Right up until we get very close to T =0. Then our maths gives results like infinity ( which are meaningless in this context ). This means we can't trust our models at that position of the universe. I don't understand your meaning. But we can give very accurate descriptions of just before T =0 by winding our mathematical models ' backwards '. But as I said, if we go too close to T =0 the maths stops making sense. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>So this adds up to " the math makes no sense, therefore inverse square law ".???<br><b> S2:5-  </b>No. your point wast that at T =0 there was no space so gravity was strong enough to prevent any expansion of space. I was pointing out only that gravity did not exist at that position of the universe. You then went on to say that we could not check this point and I replied with mathematical models that could be ' wound backwards ' along time but that they become less and less accurate as we approach T =0. My original point was that gravity is more weak than the metric expansion of space when the distances invloved are large as this invokes the inverse squre law as it applies to gravity ( and it cannot take advantages of it's cumulative effects ). Remember the metric expansion of space only ocures at super cluster scales. In smaller scalse gravity wins out.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-1476_151_150__152_153_155_158_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I wonder if being gay is a genetic, or environmental behaviour. Some say it is genetic, but im not so sure, because if it were genetic, then it would be exceedingly rare, as children cannot come from a same sex union. So someone who was gay from birth would be less likley to mate with someone from the opposite sex, and therefore the gene would be found less and less as time went on. I think being gay is an environmental condition. I read a long time ago that in the animal kingdom, homosexuallity was found in populations where one sex outnumbered the other.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That is a very simplistic view of genetics and natural selection. If the nieces and nephews of a gay person had a slightly raised fecundity for example, then there would be positive selection pressure for such a " gay gene ". <br><b>S1:2-  </b>can you dumb that up a bit for me?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Put crudely, your siblings share some of your genes and so if their kids survive and have kids of their own ( this is how fecundity is measured ), then some of your genes get passed on. If your assistance ( as a homosexual non-reproductive person ) increases the number of reproductively successful offspring your siblings produce then this offsets the fact that you haven't produced any kids yourself. It's a contraversial idea, but it isn't one that can be completely ruled out. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Would the gene not become less prevelant the longer it is inactive? like of a cousin of someone gay is not gay and they have kids and so on for many generations without the occurence of homosexuallity.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>We are talking a hypothetical gene here. If homosexuality has a genetic component, it will be the result of a combination of many genes. Also it is not a simple case of genes fading away becaus they are inactive : it is invariably way more complex than that. The best example I can think of is with the European crested newt. Every one of them is a heterozygous individual ( can't remember for which gene ( s )). They mate and half the offspring are homozygous. Both homozygous forms are fatal in early development and only the heterozygous ones become adults. A whole 50% of the eggs produced die because of a fatal gene combination that the newt cannot escape from...</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-6008_12_11__13_14_15_16_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I did not touch on this much in my thread-starter, but the concept of plasticity is quite powerful. For instance, depending on what one's diet is early on in life, the organism can be shaped and molded to fit that diet. I believe this is what happens to finches, just as it happens to tadpoles ( see below. ) We used polyphenic spadefoot toad tadpoles ( Spea bombifrons and S. multiplicata ) to test the hypothesis that character displacement evolves to minimize competition for food. We also sought to evaluate the role of phenotypic plasticity in the mediation of competitive interactions between these species. Depending on their diet, individuals of both species develop into either a small-headed omnivore morph, which feeds mostly on detritus, or a large-headed carnivore morph, which specializes on shrimp. http://www.citeulike.org/user/balicea/article/454684 The fact is, darwinists insist that traits are formed by genes, that over time, spread throughout the population. But this absurd and wrong. The truth is that creatures evolve individually -- and all creatures of a population evolve at the same time according to what their habitat is. It's amazing the common sense that has been withheld by the likes of the scientific community. But once common sense is exposed as to how nature really works, the theory of evolution just fizzles away to into obscurity.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Answer the question please <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Your question is a strawman.... because I look at evolution on an individual basis... not a populational basis. Who's to say certain individuals do not develop lighter shades over their lifetime -- or even as the generations pass within his descendants? ( Besides, I do believe that Black Americans are generally lighter shades than black Africans. ) But where can I find these tests on pigmentation changes? Answer : nowhere -- and that's because science is AFRAID of what they might find. ( they could do the same tests on animals -- can you point to these? ) of course you can't. Besides different people have different environments and different habitats. Some work inside, some work outside. Some work all day in 100 heat with lots of sunshine, some lay around all day inside and be lazy in the air condition. Strawman. Try again.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Based on what you say, all individuals should, within a few generations, adapt to the best suited phenotype. The fact this doesn't happen invalidates your " theory ". Nice try Where can I find these tests on the specific type of green cheese that makes up the moon? Answer : nowhere -- and that's because science is AFRAID of what they might find. ( they could do the same test on asteroids -- can you point to these? ) of course you can't. Complete and utter ignorance. Please don't try again. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Your logic is outmatched, man.

If Adam and Eve didn't have belly buttons, why have all the pictures always depicted them with such an accessory? And why do men have nipples? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Men have nipples for the same reason they have any other body part -- because they were created that way.

Shall I continue? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yes, when you can show the threads and post numbers where I have referred to all this. There is good reason for the Bible to be arranged as is commonly accepted today. From " How Reliable Is The Bible ", by Judson Poling ; That's good enough for me. Now you don't have to guess at what I reject or accept concerning scripture, and why.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well, you know.. Judson was quite wrong about the ' new testament books '. Many were, but not all. And, you are rejecting many of the scriptures. despite the fact one of your scriptures ( 2 timothy ) says not to, and 2nd timothy was written between 100 and 150 C. E, which directly contradicts the claim of Judson Poling For that matter, the Gospel of john, 1st john and second john all were written after 90, and perhaps as late as 120. Judith and Baruch were written in the bc time frame, with Baruch being about 200 B.C. and Judith was written proably between 160 BC and 140 BC. So, your ' rational ' is based on misinfomration. And it means that you ' pick and choose ' what is ' scripture '.. It makes your quoting of 2 timothy totally irrelavant and hipocrytical. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>What is YOUR source?

But you keep it up, you're just blowing smoke all over the place as you attempt to make throwing six rolls of the same number with one dice a common place event.

The same question for the new " fish " what species were they classified as?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The concept of ' species ' is a human construct. Plant and animal populations in the wild do not have to conform to it, and all degrees of separation from 0% to 100% can be found. I'm not sure why you've put " mouse " in quotes : the Faroe Islands Mouse is most certainly a mouse. By convention, it becomes a species in its own right, distinct from Mus musculus, when it is sufficiently reproductively isolated from Mus musculus for hybridisation between the two to fail to produce fertile offspring. In practice, this is not a clear-cut event, but quite long drawn out : commonly, hybrids first produce offspring of which one sex is fertile, the other sterile. This is when the Wallace Effect kicks in : individuals of either population that are pre-disposed to avoid hybridisation have a major reproductive advantage, and pre-zygotic isolation is quickly established. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>so mice are classified as mus musculus but within this classification there are further distinctions, ie mus musculus faeroensis? a follow-up question - is the " Wallace Effect " reversable? has there ever been an instance where, over time, animals which have grown reproductively incompatible become compatible again?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The house mouse is Mus musculus. There are several other species of Mus, and numerous other genera broadly described as ' mice '. The wood mouse, for example, is Apodemus sylvaticus. The Faroe Islands Mouse is a population that has diverged genetically from Mus musculus. When that divergence establishes reproductive isolation from the ancestral species, we will call it a species in its own right. But bear in mind that species are defined by humans, and the dividing lines are not clear-cut. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>two questions : Is mouse a species? It seems that species is being defined here as what I had thought of as sub-categories of species, ie a wood mouse. Also, you make defining a species sound very subjective. Is there not a good scientific definition that can be followed?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The generic word ' mouse ' - a small pointy-faced rodent - does not describe a species. If you captured males and females of the house mouse, the field mouse and the wood mouse, and put them together in all possible male / female combinations, you'd find house mice would mate only with house mice, field mice only with field mice, etc. The wood mouse is emphatically not a sub-category of some over-arching ' mouse ', but rather a genus and species in its own right. ( As a rough analogy, are humans a sub-category of ape? ) The only reliable scientific definition is the one I have given : a species is a population whose members are capable of mating to produce fertile offspring with each other, but not with other populations. In the real world, there are very many stages on the way to that condition. Look up South American Drosophila populations if in doubt. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>thanks for the clarification...</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-9101_187_184__190_192_193_195_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Actually, birds are on top in your picture.

Do you therefore disagree with this definition? If so why did you post it? If you do agree with it, why did you claim that you don't think chimps are monkeys?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I stated the connection was primates. Your attempt to mine for something of substance to back up your theory that I am ' confused ' is quite sad. You were answered in the first post ; you rejected that based on a feeling.

Now with the rats becomeing stronger and smarter, it is great evidence for speciation. Just as we know that the earth continents are shifting, we do know there is speciation within species, these are facts. The problem is however, who is to say that speciation is all there has ever been since the beginning of time. To say speciation is factual evidance for evolution is weak, because all we know of speciation is that there can be changes within a species but there is no evidance that speciation on its own is evidance for an animal to change into a completely differant animal, this is why the fact can only be used to support a theory and not evolution as fact. It is true that there is alot of facts that they use to try and support the whole evolution theory, its just that these facts on there own have no grounds to support evoulution as being fact, until they can come up with some strong archaeologcial evidence, evolution will only ever remain a theory..<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Actually the skeletons of members of the whale family are good evidence of animals changing over time into completely different animals. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Show me were i can find this evidance and i will chase it up then weigh it up!<br><b> S2:2-  </b>http://darla.neoucom.edu/DEPTS/ANAT/whaleorigins.htm <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Thanx sinjin, I appreciate you chaseing up what you believe to be evidance, however all you have provided is the skeletal remains of a land creature, the rest is all theory to explain how these things become whales..

It is very interesting how a whale does breath oxygen and feed its young with its milk, all we need to do now is prove that this just hasent been the case since the time the whales were created. What would have been real impressive is if that land creature had the remains of fins!.. What you have nailed though, that this is a perfect example as evolution being presented as fact not theory. quote " scientists have long known that Cetaceans ( whales, dolphins & porpoises ) descend from four footed land mammals.

All the recent historical facts put fourth by Winnick, combine perfectly with what ID proponent Phillip Johnson puts into words so well ; " Whenever the " separate realms " logic surfaces [ science = facts, religion = faith ] you can be sure that the wording implies that there is a ruling realm ( founded on reality ) and a subordinate realm ( founded on illusions which must be retained for the time being ). Retained, that is, merely for the sake of public relations. The scientific elites know they must not press the anti-religious implications of scientific naturalism too explicitly, lest the natives grow restless and rebel. But by employing the fact / value distinction, they can reassure the public of their great respect for religion, while at the same time reducing it to noncognitive, subjective experience that need not be taken seriously in the public realm.

A group of Creationists came up with " intelligent design " and tried to pass it off as science in an attempt to get " GOD " put back into Public Schools. Their Effort has failed in Courts all around the Country. ID'ers are Creationists with a cool new name.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The fact remains that current subscribers of ID do not have the same basic premise as most Creationists. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>There is no Evidence to support this as a fact. The fact is that ID'ers are Creationists. If " GOD " or a Creator is involved then it's Creation.. ID'ers have been attempting for years to distance themselves from Creationism but their beliefs have remained the same. That is the facts...<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If you are saying intelligent design necessitates belief in God, then you have a warped sense of reason. Saying something was intelligently designed doesn't require belief in the supernatural. You are, of course making another common fallacy here, similar to the Nazi Fallacy. You are attempting to argue not on the substance of the matter, but instead to connect your opponent with a group that is easier to dismiss. Guilt by association. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I'm afraid your sense of reason is the one that is warped.. Intelligent design Does rely on the Premise that there is an Intelligent Designer which would in fact be Creation. No one is arguing that that Intelligent Designer has to be the Biblical God. There are other Religious people who also believe " THEIR " Deity created Life.. They all fall under Creationists.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I don't really know. What I can be sure of however, is that it did not come about by chance in the alotted time. ( 4 Billion years ) Why IDers want to prove ID is irrelevant, its the proof itself that matters. Or evolution could have been guided by the ID entity, if so, then the term creation would only apply loosly. You want to argue against a creationist. The basic premise is different, and you can't handle that. Lets see : Xcaliber : Your a creationist!!! I win. Person : No I'm not. Xcaliber : I don't believe anything you say, your still a creationist!! I win. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Then it wouldn't be Evolution now would it. Simple Fact of Life.. Intelligent Design is just an umbrella term that creationists use to mask the fact that they believe in the invisible creator. In other words, Intelligent design IS Creationism..

Dawkins claims that the human eye is not the product of intelligent design. He cites as a reason that it is so poorly put together. The inference from this though is that if you can detect poor design - as proof that there is no ' creator ', then we can also look for good design, as proof that there is! Thanks to Mr Dawkins raising the issue.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yes, he threw the ID camp a bone. Tell us, Monty - what have the ID ' scientists ' been doing to look for design? I mean besides reading other people's research and proclaiming " See! Design! "? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I'm glad you asked... William Dembski has come up with the " Explanatory Filter " to determine if something is a natural occurring event, or not. See p 171ff of " Doubts about Darwin : A History of Intelligent Design " by Thomas Woodward.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Unfortunately, Dembski and his " explanatory " filter are more hot air than substance. He has claiming to have ' discovered ' desing in nature by using the ' filter ', but for some strange reason, he has yet to publish his amazing discovery. he said he was going to do it in " Mere Creation ", then he said it would be iun " No Free Lunch " - so tell us, IS IT actually in his newest collection of apocryphal tall tales, or is is just assumed that he has done so? Common tactic - keep claiming that you will do something, then claim to have already done it later on, without, of course, actually doing it. The only times Dembski has acxtually applied it, he did it to things 1. we know were the product of design and 2. never did it on anything biological. It is all fluff and hot air. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So how long did Darwin take to publish?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>A while. But that was because he was afraid of the repercussions. Demsbki, unlike Darwin, has been a vocal, politically active proponant of the efficacy of his supposed filter. So, I take it that he did not actually use the filter in this latest collection of creationist essays, lest you would have just said so. How does it feel to be lead along like so many lemmings? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Simply put, the proposition was made that because he hasn't ' published ', he's wrong. By an extension of that logic, Darwin was also wrong, until he published. Another assumption you make is that Dembski isn't concerned over strife. I don't know? Would you care to tell me? But even worse an assumption is that Dembski is hiding something, by keeping all this information to himself, or his clique. You asserted this, I believe. Simply, this is not the case... http://www.arn.org/docs/dembski/wd_explfilter.htm and http://www.windowview.org/ARNfiles/E...erDembski.html and http://www-acs.ucsd.edu/~idea/dembski.htm OR If the information wasn't out there, then this negative critique could never have been drawn up... http://www.nctimes.net/~mark/bibl_science/dembski.htm and http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/p...th/sept98.html and http://www.talkreason.org/articles/dem_nfl.cfm So, there is already a debate raging.

Like any scientific theory, it is inherently falsifiable. Find a rodent with DNA more similar to humans than mice or find a monkey or dinosaur fossil in cambrian rocks and you would disprove large parts of evolution theory. " Evolutionists " as a whole would then respond by seeking a new theory to explain how the organims we see around us today came to be. Evolution isn't supported through faith ; it is supported through fact. It has no need for faith as it isn't something that would be clung to if it were ever proven false. YEC is the opposite. Do not deceive yourself into thinking that " literal " Biblical Creation would be proved true if evolution were proven false. We would need a third theory.

On another baord, a creationist that has a BS in electronics engineering claimed that he is a " scientist " because he has a bachelor's of SCIENCE, and that therefore, his opinions on evolution should carry as much weight as any other ( real ) scientist. They do what they have to to convinve themselves ( and others ) that their opinions actually have merit.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>As I have already stated, I would not consider someone to be a scientist unless they have a phD. However, I just went to a science museum on vaction two weeks ago and they had a whole room devoted to the science of engineering. I do not agree that because you can earn a B.S. in it it makes it a science. However, they fact that MrJack pointed out that some universites consider Math to be science and some don't shows that obviously there is also a debate over this and so neither side is right. In one final concluding mark I turn to my old faithful unabridged Webster's for a defintion of science : ( I am not writing it all, you will have to trust I didn't leave out anything that could prove your point or look it up yourself and counter quote me. ) 2. Any bracnh or department of systemized knowledge considered as a distinct field of observation or study. 4. A branch of study which is concerned with observation and classification of facts, esp. with the establishment ( and, strictly, the quantitative formulation ) of verifiable general laws, chiefly by induction ( Well, there are eight, I will end there ) So, although Webster is no scientist ( or is he? ) the point is it is kind of a pointless debate. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Indeed. One should wonder then why so many creationists expend so much energy insisting that they are scientists or that thier sources are...<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I am all for creationists forming their own branch of discovering things and not call it science. However, I also believe there are certain strong Christians who are able ( and needed ) to go to public universities and study the religion of science in an effort to keep up on its current theories and debates so that they can be refuted or at least so that a logical arguement can be presented for God. However, I have read the end of the book, and I know that I am fighting a losing battle. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Sad how readily intelligent humans can be buffloed by ancient mythology...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Sad how people who allude to being intellegent call everything the Bible says mythology, when PhD historians from state universities admit there is more history than " mythology " in the Bible.

I have no such failure of imagination and can imagine how life could have started without a designer. Both positions are simple personal opinion though as we do not know, and probably never will know, how life started.

It's hardly rocket science you know. Show me an example of a tree writing to the weather forcasters asking for the current temperature. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>actually, the leaf angel could not communicate anything to the tree, because that would also require the tree having a mind to receive the message. it must be that the leaf angel miraculously cuts off nutrient supply from each leaf on each tree in that temperate zone. the tree cannot respond to stimuli at all, for that matter, because the information ( such as direction of light source, soil moisture content, presence of nutrients, etc ) cannot be detected unless an intelligent mind is present to receive and process the information and take the appropiate action in response. those trees must have lots of angels...<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You are confused.

DNA is the media for transmitting the message from the leaf angel to the leaf. The leaf doesn't receive the message as it isn't a mind. That is the scientific law.

I fail to see a hard connection between thermodynamics and evolution. TD has to do with the movement ( dynamics ) of heat ( thermal ) energy. Evolution has to do with cell reproduction which may or may not involve heat energy.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You're not seeing it because there isn't one. The argument that the creationsts make is that the 2nd law says that disorder must increase, evolution says that life becomes more complex, therefore evolution violates the second law. If you hang out on many EvC boards you see this come up all the time, and every time people carefully explain how the creationists are confused about what the second law means, and then it pops up again a little later. It's either frustrating or funny, depending on your outlook. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>... but the 2nd law does not say that disorder must increase. It has nothing to do with disorder. It basically says that heat energy flows along the gradient from warm things to cooler things and will not flow in reverse on its own. Just as we should not apply Kirchoff's 1st Law to compressable gases, we should not apply the laws of thermodynamics to biological evolution.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It does actually address disorder, see post 16 above. The real reason it's irrelevant is that it only applies to closed systems. If you pour huge amounts of energy into a system, for example sunshine onto the earth, then the second law can't be used. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I see your post, but I'm not convinced. That's like my saying marriage can be thought of in terms of order and disorder. Heat transfer has nothing to do with disorder. It has only to do will the movement of heat from one body to another.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The second law isn't about heat transfer per se, that's where you're confused. It deals with entropy. One aspect of entropy is order and disorder. Another is heat transfer. Here's a definition : elements in a closed system tend to seek their most probable distribution ; in a closed system entropy always increases. So if you're dealing with heat, it says that heat won't go from cold to hot by itself. If you're thinking about order and probability, it says that the air molecules in the room you're in will stay randomly distributed, and not all form a sphere in the corner. In the end it's all about the entropy. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>... but the distribution of air molecules in a room has more to do with Brownian motion than with heat transfer.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Can you expand on that? I'm not getting your point. Edit : Not sure if this address what you were saying, but it's relevant so I'll throw it in. The distribution of air molecules has nothing to do with heat transfer. It does, however, have alot to do with entropy. Entropy influences heat flow. Entropy also influences air distribution. These influences are described by the second law.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3076_5_4__6_7_8_15_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I reckon that evolution is still just a theory for a valid reason.

Answer : You cannot. Are you referring to macro or micro evolution? It does make a difference. Could it be that evolution is true when referring to lower forms of life, but totally false when talking about man?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You didn't even open the link did you? Act of Fraud : fallacy : argument via laziness. That makes two acts of fraud upon your part. The link clearly gives examples of transitional fossils. Merely because you do not wish to learn ( or bother to simply click on a link provided to you ) does not make it wrong nor your claims correct. I suppose these two acts of fraud removes any credibility of you saying you seek and speak the truth. Why would there be any difference? I'm with thebootfitter, it seems likely that you will ignore any evidence of transitional fossils regardless of what anyone says.

It's quantum fluctuations.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Stonewall, I know it was stated that there was nothing more to say, but I just like debating too much :) Besides, you brought up the uncertainty principle and I want to talk about that for a bit. I understand that the uncertainty principle, based on the probability of a wave function, states that it is inherently impossible for someone to find out the estimate of where the position of a particle is and its momentum at the same time. But why does this necessitate that the particle itself does not follow certain laws that determine its path? Isn't the inherent indetermination on the part of the observer not being able to predict the particles behavior? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It's not about us ( or the observer ) measuring it, it's about the way the particles actually act... it's a law of physics itself. Take our sun for instance. For the atoms in the sun to overcome the strong nuclear force and allow for hydrogen fusion, the temperature needs to be around 10 billion degrees K. The sun's temperature, though, is only about 15 million degrees K... The gravity that is crushing these atoms ( and causing the heat ) is putting the hydrogen nuclei into a very tiny box, which severely limits where the protons can be found ( meaning the momentum and position don't have a lot of options here ). Because of this, the uncertainty principle allows protons to jump out of the nucleus in what is know as tunneling. Without the uncertainty principle, the sun wouldn't shine at all. It doesn't matter that there is no observer in the middle of the sun to see it, it is the simple principle that causes these particles to act sporadically.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You think that observing has nothing to do with it? Aren't you getting off track with what Heisenberg himself said? What about wave-function collapse? The very act of observing collapses the wave function. Where are you coming from, Copenhagen or Decoherence? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Did I say that observation has nothing to do with the uncertainty principle? No. I understand the wave-function collapse, and I already made reference to it in this thread with the double slit experiment... but it isn't about the observer. As I showed with tunneling, it's a real law of nature and will affect the way particles act whether anyone observes them or not. The particle can't allow itself to be in a position where both its momentum and position are known, regardless if anyone is actually there to do the measurement. You were implying that particles may behave ' rationally ' and that it is the observations that make them seem crazy, but that is completely incorrect. They actually behave ridiculously no matter what, and that is the beauty of it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But isn't this quantum indeterminacy resolved through observation? I mean, your using the uncertainty principle as a basis to say that quantum events are uncaused sporadic fluctuations ( particles popping into existence ) right? How exactly does collapsing the wave function play into this? If it is observed, do particles all of sudden behave deterministic?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8435_459_456__460_461_463_464_470_5<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Bull Your equation is not modeling something equals nothing any more than 42 models the universe.

There is simply no reason to believe that life itself might not be common, but maybe by far the most common examples of life are simple microbial ones. We wouldn't expect to detect them at present even if every solar system had at least one example. More and more complex life is likely ( if the earth's history is a typical one ) to be increasingly more improbable, known to have existed only in about the last 500 million years of the 3 - 4 billion years of life on earth. And technologically adept life has only existed for the last few hundred years. If you imagine the history of life as extending from your shoulder to your fingertip, chopping off the fingers would wipe out most complex life, while while a single swipe of a nail file would wipe out human civilisation. So asking why we haven't detected life out there yet is not a very telling question.

The theory of evolution was first, then abioegenesis. We know life exists.

How did they know it came from somewhere? Because there's life here now! The answer to the question of where it all started didn't get seriously studied until well after Darwin. So no, the one does not pick up from the other, and the study of evolution does not in any way depend on abiogenesis.

You'll have to scroll down a bit, but here's the gist of it : I'm also interested in what you have to say about the recently discovered Homo floresiensis. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Jakarta Post ( JP ) ran an article on 8 November 2004 titled    RI scientists refute Flores Man finding.    ( RI = Republic of Indonesia. ) The article reports Dr. Teuku Jacob, a paleoanthropology professor from Gadjah Mada University, as saying :    The skeleton is not a new species as claimed by these scientists, but simply a fossil of a modern human, Homo sapiens, that lived about 1,300 to 1,800 years ago.    The bones were unfossilized and wet. National Geographic is famous for it's Piltdown Bird fraud. To quote them as a scientific source is a joke. It is not a science magazine. If you were alive back then you would have believed in Nebraska Man and Piltdown Man. Think about that! Then look at this pick and say to yourself, Long ago and far far away.

And again, I ask : If these are just humans with microcephaly, where are the normal humans that should have lived among them? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You will have to ask the Jakarta Post about that but it defies credibility that wet bones could be that old let alone the 38,000 that are claimed. http://www.thejakartapost.com/yester...d=20041106.A05 Again if you want to argue the moronic missing link theory go to that post.

In the case of snake head mimicry, the carnivorous animals select ( for dinner ) the prey that look least like a snake, leaving the snake-like to select similarly marked mates and replicate themselves with more ( quantity wise ) snake-like offspring. A subsequent random mutation produces a more snake-like appearance that enables the mutants to survive the selection-for-dinner process and proceed to the selection-for-mating process. It does seem plausible that similarly marked males and females would naturally select each other and reject others that do not have similar markings. Is this ^^^^^^^^^ correct?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yeah, that's about right, mostly. Natural selection can involove mating and preying, but that's not the only mechanism. Anything that gives you an edge over your fellows can be used for selection. Ability to not be eaten, ability to catch prey, ability to open nuts, stamina, large size, small size, bright colors, camoflage, bad taste, scary appearance. Any of these might make you live longer and thus be selected for, depending on specific circumstance. As for how worms select mates, I don't know the details, but I wouldn't assume that coloration necessarily plays an important role. They may well identify prosepective mates by pheremones ; similar coloration could be utterly irrelevant. You'd have to answer that question on a species by species basis, and I don't know the answer for this species. Scratch that, I do know. The worms don't mate, the butterflies do. So the coloration of the worm is irrelevant for mating in this case. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Would not the coloration of the worm ( caterpillar ) determine the coloration of the butterfly thus causing similarly marked caterpillars to metamorphose into similarly marked butterflies? It seems that the trait ( snake-head-shaped tail ) on the caterpillar must be passed through each generation regardless of whether the butterfly has any resemblance to a snake.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The whole genome would get passed on, yes. But totally different genes could, and almost certainly do, govern the color of the butterfly as opposed to the color of the caterpillar. So the snake-like coloration would have no effect on mating habits, aside from the fact that caterpillars with that coloration are more likely to live long enough to mate at all. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>That was the point. The selection of something other than the snake-like caterpillar as a food item is partially responsible for the mating opportunity of the surviving butterfly... the natural selection here being attributed to the carnivore, not the survivor.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I was responding to your statement " It does seem plausible that similarly marked males and females would naturally select each other and reject others that do not have similar markings ". The coloration of the caterpillars would not work that way, since it's not the caterpillars that mate. But otherwise you have it right. Edit : Or mostly so. I'm getting a little nitpicky here, but you wouldn't say that " natural selection " is be attributed to the carnivore, that's not how the term is used. The process is natural selection, it's acting on the caterpillar, and the agent in this case is predation. Not a big deal, it just seems that you're getting this stuff well enough that you should be using the terms correctly.

Why is it necessary to have to " come from somewhere ", for if it came from ' somewhere ', then can it not follow that it must have been created by another even higher being, and thus the question logically follows through infinity. Thus using Occams Razor here, it appears that the simplest answer is that the Intelligent Designer always existed.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>No the simplest answer is no designer. You missed one regression. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>If the simplest thing is no designer, then you are back to a paradox in that you have life, but no scientific explanation of life except conjectures and hypothesises. The necessity of ' high school biology ' teaching conjecture is that evolutionists are backed up against the wall with their pants down, sic, when they arrive at OOI. To them, this is completely unacceptable, much like AGW ' scientists ' being stymied by the recent 10 year cooling period, cannot explain it, and find it totally unacceptable. The ' simplest thing ' is just to admit you don't know.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Your error here is to say that no scientific explanation at this moment in time means no scientific explanation ever. I don't get your point. Who is saying anything other than " We don't know "? As far as I'm aware nobody ' knows ' exactly how life originated. But what we do know is adding extraneous entities ( such as supernatural beings ) does not help our understanding one iota. When a scientist does not know something they are not ' backed up against the wall '. That is the challenge every scientist revels in. Trying to understand what is yet unknown is the point of science. Getting to a point where there are questions we can't answer yet ( such as the mechanism for the origin of life ) is what keeps scientist doing research and hard work to answer those questions. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No ' error ' as that is not what I said.

You throw a bunch of organic molecules in, apply some energy and out pops something more complex than anything that was put in. Over the surface of an entire planet, this could be reasonably speculated to happen millions of times a second. Over the course of millions of years, this can happen billions and billions of times. Many self replicating molecules could have popped up during this time. The next hurdle is finding one that is stout enough to survive UV light, heat. etc. Evidence suggest that as soon as the Earth cooled enough for organic molecules to remain stable, life emerged. I may be confused here, but are you suggesting that because there was no line leading up to the first replicating molecule that evolution could not have taken over since there was no process already in place? My understanding is that once you have a surviving population of anything that are all able to pass on information to subsequent populations in an imperfect manner, evolution is inevitable.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So you're saying that a dog could have evolved from a cat, right? Or a rabit or a beaver ; I mean, who knows what will pop out based on those organic molecules and just the right amount of energy. Of course you can't prove any of this, I should just take your word for it though cuz you really really believe it, right? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Actually I was talking about self replicating molecules and the idea that life is supposedly IC. I didn't expect you to understand any of it.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But you said in the post right above that more complex molecules do form from simpler ones given enough energy. I assumed you were referring to more complex life forms evolving from simpler ones since it is evolution we are discussing here, no? This just seems to be more of the slippery definitions which always change and never remain consistent enough to actually pin down. You apologists for evolution can't defend your religion to save your lives, can you. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Actually, like I said, I didn't expect you to get it. I was talking about more complex molecules forming from simpler molecules when energy is applied, just like I said. I never said more complex lifeforms. Again, make sure you know what you are talking about before you attempt to refute someone's claim.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>More arrogance and condescension from the guy who can't phrase his post clearly enough to be understood by someone he considers to be a novice. BTW, the discussion is about evolution of the species, not molecules. Unless you're going to come back and say that one leads to the other in which case your claim that I didn't get it is proven to be completely bogus as usual. In any event, you prove how slippery your ideology is as you attempt to not get proven wrong by me. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Actually, one does lead to the other. That is the relevance.

Your meiopic focus on an organism developing a new limb is flawed because such an observation is not required to prove ToE is a valid model, and therefore its absence does not disprove ToE as a valid model. Developing a new limb is only one of many possible results of genetic variance. Incidentally since you mentioned speciation, here is a link to a fairly extensive list of examples where speciation ( the creation of a new species ) has been observed. Examples of speciation. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I am not disputing the fact that genes change over time. That's not what the creation v evolution debate is all about. I'm disputing the allegation that all life evolved from a common ancestor. Your link only points to examples where population changed slightly but enough so that evolutionists can dub it a new species. There were never any new body parts OR new functions evolved in a population in which it was absent.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Funny, because the title of this thread ( which you started ) is " There is absolutely no convincing evidence of the theory of evolution ". In this thread, you also directly attack ToE and once again identify it by name. Perhaps you should clarify your threads, then and start discussing the implication of ToE that we all have common ancestry, rather than ToE as a whole. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>What's there to clarify?

However, a better set of inequalities is as follows : c + e > c - e e - c > e + c And therefore we also have : e - c > c - e Or in other words : e - c > e + c > c - e So a better representation of the original inequality is : e - c > ( c - e ) AND ( e + c )<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Oops, I think YOU made a mistake here on the second one.

In fact, I made it clear that I was providing BETTER inequalities than you did. YOU EVEN QUOTED ME AS SAYING THAT!!! Then you turn right around and pretend that I didn't anything of the sort?!?!

As you are not concerned with supporting evidence though, you are free to believe otherwise. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>When has the creation of the Earth and the life upon it ever been proven false? By who?

It has however been proven that the version of creation specified in Genesis is false. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Gotcha, I was reading too much into it.

And.. to answer your question, Life means more to me, it gains value, when it has a grander purpose than.. nothing.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Well, all right. As I " look to the furture " I just wonder what science will eek out of life. But I don't " believe " that that they'll be able to prove one thing over some other thing.

As for something like life on other planets to give another example, I suppose that we will one day discover that life is not unique to the Earth, but I don't really know that and I don't " believe " it or " disbelieve " it. As for purpose, do you just have a hunch that life has some grand purpose or do you have a strong belief in such? If so, do you speculate upon what that purpose may be? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>My hunch turned into a strong belief over time. I have come to understand that I, nor any other human has the capacity to understand the " grand purpose ". I came to this realization when I realized that our minds have certain limitations. Over time, my awe of the universe has manifested itself in appreciation, praise, and growth. This is what I feel that I can lend.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well, I have this hunch, maybe even a strong belief, that no human has the capacity to even determine if there is such a thing as the " grand purpose ". <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Too late...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Too late for what? So, here's a nice NYT article that I thought I'd throw in here. I think this article does a good job of explaining the debate in a fair and balanced way while still getting across the fact that Intellegent Design is pseudoscience and evolutionary theory still works ( well ). http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/22/na...rtner=homepage</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-4585_9_8__10_11_13_25_29_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Check this site ; http://www.discovery.org/csc/aboutCSC.php A few notable names there are Micheal Behe, William Dembski, and Phillip Johnson. They may not fit your definition of " scientests ", but they have some interesting things to say.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Behe is certainly a very talented and able scientist in the field of biochemistry - he just let his religion and incredulity get in the way when it comes to descent and evolution. Dembski isn't a scientist - he is a mathematian / theologian, and nor is Phillip E. Johnson, a Professor of Law. Johnson in particualr should stick to his areas of expertise - besides rubbishing evolution he also likes to spend time advocating that HIV and AIDS are unrelated. I bet the professional Medical community appreciates his input on that as much as paleontologists do regarding evolution. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Are there not also many very talented and able scientests who let their personal atheism ( and livelihood ) get in the way when it comes to ID?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, as there are plenty of evolutionists who believe in God - its not a matter of religious outlook but the ability to discern the best model to explain the evidence to hand. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>There are actually plenty of both. The most vocal and often most politically influential are the ones who are closed minded about their atheism. The " talk origins " web site is loaded with them.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>What on earth do you mean by " closed minded about their atheism "? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Those who " refuse to allow a divine foot in the door ". Those who discard any scientific evidence that corresponds with the Bible. Those who BEGIN with the belief that there is no God - a predetermined conclusion that their research must lead to.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-2076_61_58__63_67_68_71_73_74_76_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>But then you would always need to state it, this is redundant so it is reasonable not to bother.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Not at all. When you continually state something that you supposedly don't really believe, it gives the appearance of a belief. That's what you're doing here. You argue against Creation, by appealing to the facts as known by science, but then you also argue that you're not really sure about them anyway. It's an odd stance to take. And it is part of the variance within evolutionists arguments ; it's a fact, then it's not, your certain that Creation is not true, but then you can't be certain of anything etc. You are certain as best you can be of evolution, but this is based on evidences you're not really sure how to cobble together. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No other stance makes sense to me.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Sure, then you make a case for a ' just so ' belief in evolution. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I don't understand your point. Perhaps you could give us an argument that is not a ' just so ' argument<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Very cute. I already did. It's in this thread. See rebuttal to Mach re : evolution just based on evidence. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Sorry I was not specific enough. Give an example of argument that is not a just so argument that deals with the diversity of life on earth. Also what EXACTLY do you mean by saying " very cute "?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Why should I? You're content to let arguments go from your own camp that are ' just-so '. I see no reason why I should have to do anything different, if that's the accepted way of arguing. Far too long people have made comments about my arguments such as " they were refuted somewhere else ", and I have been at pains to go and reference mine. It is all too easy for you to do nothing but post opinions. I think I'll just do the same for a while, :) as I have a long-weekend. Further to that, should I present another science argument that gives a just-so argument, how would that validate / invalidate anything? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I don't understand your " just-so " critique. I don't undestand why my questions about it are " cute ". If you give an ANY argument about origin of life that is not ' just so ' I might understand your criticism. It can be for or against " my camp ". Or perhaps you can tell me the " just so arguments " that I tolerate.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-11_17_16__18_19_20_21_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Oh ok. By that definition, your god was wrong.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>A perfect example of why Christian fundamentalismm and evolution can't co-exist. If God is wrong, then the Bible is wrong. Evolution contradicts the Bible, plain and simple. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I don't think anyone argued that Christian fundamentalism was able to co-exist with reality. It contradicts a literal interpretation of the Bible.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Please stop making statements that have nothing whatsoever to do with the debate at hand. We're not talking about Christian fundamentalism and " reality ". And...? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Sure we are. Creationism vs all the sciences ( including the biological Theory of Evolution ) and reality. And few people hold that view anymore.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Last time I checked, it was a debate about religion and evolution co-existing. Not a debate about Creationism vs. " science " and " reality ". Few people literally interpret the Bible anymore? I'd like to see the statistics on that.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7237_32_25__37_48_51_67_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Name one. We need a savior. Jesus is the savior. Harry Potter and Santa Claus are fictitious ( hate to break it to you...). Imaginary friend... Jesus Christ. Wow. Who doesn't see the difference!?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Fred Phelps of the Westboro Baptist Church. Devout Five Point Calvinist. Represents their principles to a T. While Fred is certainly a lunatic, he still drawls a following teaching hate, prejudice, bigotry, anger, and vengeance. That's one, want more? No no. Perhaps you need a savior. I myself ( as many others ) have never felt the need to be saved. If you want to believe that you need a savior, feel free, but leave me out of it and keep it to yourself. Wait... your telling me that if deep down in my heart I believe in something that cannot be proven, and many people think does not exist that I am wasting my time on a fictitious belief? I would guess just about everyone who does not believe in Jesus as you do. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>What kind of religion does this man claim to preach for? Just wondering. Everyone needs a savior. If you deny this fact, you deceive yourself. But don't worry, many people do. Yes * braces for reply* Pretty sad, huh?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Christianity. Are you unfamiliar with Phelps? In your opinion. You opinion means jack spit to me. I have no need for a savior. I have no desire to be saved. Newsflash for ya chief ( or should I say cheif for you? )... not everyone subscribes to your personal philosophy. Why not worry about yourself and let the rest of us worry about ourselves? Yet you fail to embrace the irony. People forming their own opinions and believing what they feel works best for them... yes, sad indeed. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Ah, just wondering. Thx. Just a reminder : everyone, including Christians, sin. I am unfamiliar with Phelps, apparently for a good reason. I feel sorry for you. Only a ' jack spitter ' wouldn't. I am surprised at your stalling, why not just inform me of this irony directly? Ya, have you ever heard of scientology? Now that is pretty ridiculous.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well, perhaps you should do some reading. But now that I have given you one example of a christian preaching hate and bigotry, would you another example... or did that satisfy your requirements. Well, that's just your cross to bear. I don't feel sorry for myself in the least. But if you want to go on worrying about me... you go right ahead. Because the fact that you need it explained to you in the first place is the best part. As is the majority of organized religion. What's your point?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7237_39_34__43_46_49_56_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>God wants faith without a personal appearance. Everyone needs a savior. If you deny this fact, you deceive yourself. But don't worry, many people do.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Some gems from the slayer of fiends { whatever they are }. Nope. The creo vs evo debate is mostly about pre-christian myths of sheepherders. Old testament claims not NT at all. Don't worry FS many people deny that they need a savior without self-deception. Indeed its often due to self discovery. Nope, the persons who claim to speak for GOD want their beliefs validated on the basis of faith. GOD does not put in a personal appearance because he / it is a creation of men and a fictional one at that. Now just what is it you think I need to be " saved " from? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That is only half. The only thing that separates Christianity from Judaism ( both creationism religions ) is Jesus. You need to give evidence against both the books of the Old Testament as well as the New Testament. Self-discovery is okay as long as you are saved from your sin. If God were to come down in all of his glory right now, you'd be ' like the chaff that the wind drives away '. You, obviously, need to be saved from your sin. We all do. Accept Jesus into your heart ASAP. You don't need to read the Bible or even go to Church, just spread the Good News about Him. It's ' feinds ', not fiends. Jeeze.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Nope, the creation is only described in the OT, not in the NT. All the claims are OT and thats long before Christ and Christianity. What one discovers of course is that SIN ( esp original SIN ) is a guilt trap designed to enslave one to some religious authority who can bail you out, and that there is neither SIN nor the authority. This represents genuine salvation from the burden that organized Christian religons would place on your shoulders. Sorry but I cannot in good faith spread concepts and ideas which I find to be backwards and invalid. I leave that to you and yours. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Although creationism is described in the OT, Jesus refers to it a lot in the NT. Anyway, evos haven't disproved either wrong, so, it doesn't matter yet. When you sin, do something wrong or bad. I challenge you all to go through an entire day without even committing even one single sin. Once you realize how hard that is, try keeping track of how many sins you commit daily. Maybe then you'll see why we need a savior.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Ah yes the oldest con game in the world. Set up the game so its impossible to comply with the rules, then use the guilt effect to control the test subject. The Christians have managed to commercialize the whole concept on a mass scale. And even if a test subject thinks it has won the game and exhibits no guilt - there is always the mythical original and heritable sin to fall back on. In Adams fall we sinned all. Guilt is the father of........ economic returns!</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7237_87_82__92_94_97_100_105_4<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Name some of the products we wouldn't have without evolution. I'd like to check on how they actually originated. Links please? Not among atheists!!

" I'm simply telling the truth, so I have different debating standards than you ".<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Corn, wheat, potatoes, grapes, wine, flowers, nude mice, human beings. Will that do? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No it won't, I don't know if you intentionally missed the point or not. His implication was that without scientific study of evolution, and all the billions-of-years-old and God-is-not-necessary speculation that goes along with it, we wouldn't have been able to produce products that we have today. That products would be missing if all we do is work with and rearrange materials that we have to work with. What products would be missing?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Precisely the ones I mentioned previously and thousands upon thousand of others to boot. A full list is well beyond the scope of this forum. Nearly anything related to biology or medicine has benefited from the theory of evolution and there is a vastly larger set of products, tools, techniques to come! <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Be specific - the ones you mentioned were not. Corn, wheat, potatoes, grapes, wine, flowers, nude mice, human beings, would all be here if everyone on earth was a creationist, and you know it. I thought you'd come up with some kind of recent miracle medicine or something. Whatever it would be, I'd like to see how godless evolution brought it about.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Actually not! Especially the nude mice. And Corn, wheat, potatoes are just as impressive as any medical technology - they are what many of us live on! They all evolved and corn in particular in its modern form is the result of applying evolutionary theory and NDS to breeding increasingly more efficient and effective varieties. You can find a great deal about the genetics of corn and the breeding of disease resistant corn varieties on the net. I'll let you do the home work. As to wheat and evolution in a similar context look up the green revolution of the 1960 s and study the development of the dwarf wheats. Enjoy. Oh yes it was not GOD but rather the Rockefeller Foundation, Norman Bourlaug, and his mentor E.C. Stakeman. And of course these days we are using evolutionary concepts to deploy GE corns while at the same time avoiding so far as possible some of the evolutionary consequences of such strains. Oh yes you should examine the development of multiline small grains as part of an integrated pest control strategy. That particular technology is rooted deep into the evolutionary war between hosts and pathogens. Enjoy. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>No links? Are you describing evolution that takes billions of years, or chemical reactions and reproduction that happen comparatively quickly? The technological advances you describe actually come from mans capacity to aquire knowledge and skill in working with the here and now, and passing it along to future generations. It's not evolution at all, it's a building block process about knowledge of present day material.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-4061_29_28__30_33_34_35_4<br><b>S1:1-  </b>well so has anyone decided whos right?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I'm just waiting for you to show your source for the " odds " you quote, then I can prove to you that they're wrong. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>what if theyre not wrong<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If they're not wrong then I'll conceed that ID might have a point.

You care more about blowing your own horn than backing up what you say. Your failure to even attempt to back up what you say is simply convincing more people that what you say has no basis.

You're not demonstrating the " truth " of your position, your demonstrating the weakness of it.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-739_64_63__65_66_67_70_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>While your definitions certainly make sense, Mackers, and have a certain etymological purity about them ; they follow neither the common or historical meanings of the word. Atheism is belief in no god ( no comment on certainty made ), Theism is belief in god ( or gods, as appropriate ), Agnosticism was started by a group of French Intellectuals who basically want to avoid the whole issue, their original position was ' No Knowledge of God Until Death '. They mainained that the question of God's existence or not was unanswerable by the living, and that there was no meaningful discussion to be had from the subject. I consider their position to be nothing more than intellectual cowardice.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>atheist means non-theist. that    s what the A is for. like asexual is the lack of a sex ( non-sexual ). a sexual creature has a sex and an asexual creature has no sex. atheist meaning non-theist would be the origin of the word. would you not agree? Gnosticism is about knowledge not belief. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Atheism is derived from non-theist, but in the specific sense of no belief in any god. Agnosticism does derive from no knowledge, but in the specific sense of ' no knowledge of god before death ' ; which is a statement of belief, not of knowledge. In any case, the meaning of words is defined by their usage not by their etymology.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>well done you got the meaning right this time atheism is the lack of belief in a god ( s ) not " Atheism is belief in no god " - Mr Jack atheism is not a belief but the lack of one. gnosticism is to have knowldge of the existance of god ( for or against ) agnosticism is to have no knowledge of the existance of god. i do not believe in god but i have no knowledge in his non-existence or existence. so i am an Agnostic ( i have no knowledge in gods non-existence or existence ) Atheist ( i do not believe in god ) i agree with you. most atheists use the same meaning of the words as i do. it only seems to be theists that think all atheists just reject the possibility of god. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Nope. Atheism is the belief there is no god. This is logically equivalent to no belief in any god. ( But not specific non-belief applied to a given god ). You can be an Atheist without being certain. An Atheist need not reject the possibility of god, only hold there is not one. In the same way as I do not believe I will win the lottery, but I do not reject the ( tiny ) possibility that I might.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>' i do not belive in god ' is not the same as ' i belive there is no god ' disbelief is not the same as belief you are right an atheist can be an atheist without being certian there isn't a god. but atheism in this case is not a belief but the lack of it. a stong atheist would hold the belief there isn't a god ( s )</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3765_61_50__63_65_66_68_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Of course it matters.

And you seldom take more that two sentences to do so. Please, expand! Like I said, I've thought about this quite a bit. It's going to take more than two words to give me something new to chew on.

Feel free to ramble, I don't mind.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>lol suppose it was knowable in some realm that you were definitely going to wear a green shirt next week tuesday. you have serveral shirts of various colors, all of them equally comfortable and stylish, all of them clean. you usually pick your shirts in no particular order, and you dont wear the same color twice in a row. if you are foreknown to be wearing the green shirt on tuesday, it eliminates the option to wear the green shirt on monday, and it eliminates the option of wearing any other color shirt than green on tuesday. in other words, the option of wearing a not-green shirt on tuesday does not exist. you could not choose, for example, a white shirt on tuesday, because it would make the prediction wrong. seeing the future means that the path of options is already known. each decision you make can only be the decision you were foreseen making. the other options can never be chosen because they are not the ones you were foreseen to choose. events that lead to your decision making are also already foreknown, meaning that the other possible events that could have happened instead of the foreseen one could never possibly happen. in a future where the outcome is foreknown, only one option is choosable : the one that is foreknown. one option = no choice</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3765_83_82__84_85_86_87_4<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Thats not what quantum ambiguity shows.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>References for your claim are?? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Irwin schroedinger.

SHow me where the path can be changed once known <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The outcome does change once known in the double slit experiment. When a single photon is observed passing through one of the slits, its state collapses to a point particle. If it is not observed, the photon quanta exibits characteristics akin to a wave. This means that until cause and effect are observed, the outcome will be every possible variation. 1 the photon is emitted from the source. 2 the photon passes through the double slit barrier wich either is or is not detecting wich one of the two slits the photon passes through. 3 the photon arrives at the detector as either a particle if it was observed passing through the slit. Or a wave if it was not. This means that as the photon is manifested in the source its state is affected by the observation that will or will not happen in the future at the double slit barrier. This is an example of a future event effecting the past.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No, the event is not past.

Thats what I am saying. You have the choice to do whatever you want without knowing for sure what the concequences are. That is what allows for free will.

I decline to argue with you in the same way that I would decline to argue this with a child.. the child may still keep on but you know it really is not worth it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>the fact that i responded with the term ' mass '.. should be enough. but either way... you are not arguing, so it doesnt matter what you say. you can cry and run away if thats what you want to do. - Mosheh Thezion <br><b>S1:4-  </b>As I said.. the child may keep on but you know it is not worth it.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>then stop talking to me, and let me argue with someone who can argue. - Mosheh Thezion</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-9193_44_42__51_53_58_59_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Mosheh Thezion, how about you present a specific piece of evidence to support creationism and we'll go over it? It's not our jobs as those who do not believe in creationism to prove it.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>the greatest... and most signifigant piece of evidence is the motions of all heavenly bodies.. such as the fact that matter.. is all very organized... such as galaxies.. which are all expanding from a central core in super clusters.. And galaxies... are all spirally... expanding... as stars in orbit.. and that stars... are orbital systems... of planets.. and that all planets are made of atoms... which are spinnning orbital expansions of the same orbital scheme... The fact is... the entire cosmos... is very ordered.... structured... in a specific order... fashion.. and is anything but chaos... That is fact... real evidence... there is nothing random about it. lets start with that. - Mosheh Thezion <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I wasn't aware that physics proves God exists. How does the fact that gravity defines how objects move in space equates to God being the cause of creation?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>gravity does not define.. expanding spiral galaxies. it is completely opposite to big bang... which is why they invented dark matter and dark energy... to justify the impossibility of a big bang condensing cloud formation theory... It is obvious... that it would be to much work, to educate all of you on the sciences, and I should restrict this kind of debate to a science forum... as you people simply do not know the evidence. The fact is... you.. you... can point to any given piece of evidence.. and I can show that it fits in my theory of a dimensional progression. - Mosheh Thezion <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Clearly, you don't understand what a singularity is. Again, how does physics prove God?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>s o.. then... show me evidence for a singularity then.???? show me one black hole, provide evidence, that its a singularity and not mearly a massive black dwarf. Can you do it? can anyone? no... but go ahead and try, because that evidence does not exist. Like I said.. provide evidence... not the conceptual theory derived from the evidence. Evidence.. like the thing at the center of our galaxy... its black... its dense.. and has massive gravity... but thats all we know... and there is nothing proving its a singularity. ( A hole ) Or that singularities ( holes ) can even exist. Believing in holes in space that lead to mysterious unknowns is based on nothing but theory based on imagination... and is not evidence. try again. - Mosheh Thezion</p></body> </html>
