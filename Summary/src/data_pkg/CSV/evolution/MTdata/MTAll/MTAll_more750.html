Again you miss the point. " evolutionists see that as proof " That is an interpretation not scientific fact. I have given lots of evidence that supports creation. You are asking for a smoking gun. Neither side has one of those<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Peddler, It's a simple matter of composition. The truly white sections of the cliffs ( most of the cliffs are not in fact, white ) are composed of almost pure calcium carbonate - a soft, white stone also commonly referred to as chalk or soapstone. Don't take my word for it though, educate yourself. http://www.geologyshop.co.uk/chalk1.htm Waxy <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Why are they white meant why are they so pure that they are not discolored by contaminates. Allthough you seem to think so being a creationist does not make you stupid. I know what the cliffs are made of as does anybody who ever polished a car, a least before clear coats. The question is how did those numberless sea creatures collect in a way that filtered out any other particles-80 + % purity - over millions of years? There really is no reasonable answer for that question I have ever heard. It seems quite impossible to me. What is your answer?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Didn't you read the link? Here it is again. http://www.geologyshop.co.uk/chalk.htm It's all nicely laid out for you in a concise answer if you'd bother. Now you've heard the answer. You may also want to look into shales and other homogeneous clastic and carbonate rocks that form in much the same depositional manner. Deposition rates, especially when biologically driven as in the chalks, can be very rapid, rates can also be very slow, depending on erosion rates, water transport, water depth, etc... It's not rocket science, merely common sense. Waxy <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I have heard all of this before I am aware that it was much more tropical when the chalks formed.. I still disagree that these amazingly clear seas could have remained unchanged for millions of years. It is impossible for to some people see that their is more than one way to look at evidence. Your interpretation is an educated guess not fact. So is mine. No one was there to watch it form. Just because I disagree does not mean I am right or you are wrong. It means we disagree. Not so long ago it was believed that it took millions of years to form the Great Barrier Reef. That idea became hard to sell when the tourist started asking how many millions of years it took for the coral to grow on the chains supporting the observation platforms. Now it is down to 3800 years. Science is often wrong in it's interpretations of evidence it is unwise to not question it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I thought it was clear that it didn't require millions of years of steady state in order to produce the chalk? At any rate - I've given you an explanation, now it's your turn to buck up and present your explanation. Hopefully it will also contain the basics as to your reasoning why your explanation is more valid, or even as valid, as the currently accepted model proposed above. Please note that the Bible is not justification for your case, we're strictly talking about scientific validity and evidence. Waxy <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Why not. There is no way that either of us can know what happened. The whole point is you believe that although you have no proof that you are right that everyone else is stupid for not agreeing with you. All I wanted to do was get you to open your mind to the fact other opinions including ones that support the Bible that may be valid. My crowbar is bending in the effort. You seem constitutionally incapable of accepting that evidence must be interpreted or have been brainwashed into never daring to think outside the box. If evidence spoke for itself we would not need law lawyers or courts. To bad it does not.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3206_44_29__64_66_69_77_82_107_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The scientific method : predict then see if evidence supports the prediction. I am willing to submit to this and prove God. IF you cannot agree to this then you are really saying you will not recognize any evidence which proves God as such. IOW, your CLAIM to want to entertain evidence for God in the first place was phony - a sham. waiting and ready..... Ray M.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>this is not really the scientific method, because the prediction is usually based on an objective observation. also, the evidence needs to be qualified as both objective and relevant to the prediction anyway, i'd like to hear the prediction <br><b>S1:2-  </b>AGREED. Your input above gets more specific and adds substance to the loose framework I want to work within. We now agree a prediction MUST be in place and we agree that IF the prediction is supported with tangible objective observable evidence then rational persons must accept it as proof supporting the claims / prediction. Prediction : Impossibility = Divine involvement. Central and well known Bible claims IF supported by the above criteria = impossibility. I can support the following central Bible claims according to the prediction above : 1 ) Existence of Satan / hell. 2 ) Mankind on a downward path to hell. 2 ) Miraculous Exodus from Egypt. 3 ) Law given to Moses. 4 ) Death and Resurrection of Christ. 5 ) Age of the Church which claims its existence by the grace of God. IF I can, by the method already agreed to, that THESE claims are true then on this basis the Deity of the Bible is real and is in control of history. And IF true Darwinism and ToE is falsified IN ITS TRACKS - END OF SUBJECT. waiting..... Ray M.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>ray! you the man! ok, last things first, the only proof you can provide that would falsify darwinism and the ToE is either that God created the world as geneisis 1 and 2 describes, or some other process of creation. proving that the israelites exodused from egypt or that mankind is going to hell does not disprove evolution ok, with that out of the way, your menu of devine phenomena looks scrumptious! asking you to prove all would be both time consuming and unnecessary ; each could well deserve a thread of its own i'd like to see you prove 3 ) God gave the ten commandments, carved in stone, to moses. i picked the one that to me looks falsifiable upon physical evidence without going to deep into the ethereal realm of faith and visions. the tablet of stone, if it existed, is something physical. since you volunteered to prove this, id like to here it <br><b>S1:3-  </b>IF the 5 things listed are true then from this basis everything else in the Bible must be true = logic. If you don't agree then I am wasting my time and you are silently admitting no amount of evidence can falsify Darwinism. You are, like I've said peddaling philosophy as science. waiting..... Ray M.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>ok, ray, for the sake of the discussion, i'll concede that you proying ANY of the items on your list will build a very strong case for creation over evolution. however, strictly speaking, proving that the israelites left egypt, or that mankind is spiritually declining towards hell, or that christ died and resurrected, or anything like that does not directly address the evidence that supports darwin's theories or evolution. they are pretty unrelated. that said, i'd be extremely impressed with any type of argument you can put forward to prove any of these things. even if it doesnt directly disprove the theory of evolution ( and i really dont understand how you could expect them to disprove that ), it would prove that the phenomenon described in the bible are legit, and would give atheists something to think about. that in itself is major <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Proving the miracles of the Resurrection of Christ and the Red Sea crossing logically support the sudden creation of Genesis. If you can't agree to this logic then you are totally brainwashed lacking any objectivity whatsoever. Sudden creation is through-out the Bible. ToE says man began as an animal then gradually got better to his present state today over millions of years. The Bible says man BEGAN as a man and not an animal and was intelligent unlike an animal. These two scenrios are far apart and only one can be correct. The same source for the miracle claims says the belief that God is not the origin of created things is a penalty from God for not crediting Him AS the Creator. Therefore, this claim is evidently true IF the big miracle claims are because Darwinism exists and is thus explained as this penalty. At any rate, my NEXT post will evidence my claims. Ray M.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>you seriously lack the foggiest clue about logic. what you are doing is the same as me concluding that big foot exists by proving that paper is made from trees. both are completely independent of each other, and evidence for one is ireelevant to the other. proving thatsatan exists, mankind is going to hell, the israelites left egypt, or ANY of the things on your list does not prove or even support the idea that man was created intelligent. all these things could be true, and you'd still be no closer to proving that God created 1 man in a garden out of dirt 6000 - 10000 years ago, no more than you could conclude that pigs fly by proving ice is colder than fire.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10618_41_39__43_44_45_46_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I just noticed this. Kay, you need to retake evolutionary biology 101. Never has evolutionary theory, since Darwin's day, taught us that species go from simple to complex ; maybe in the first couple million years of multicellular evolution, but since then, no. To quote one of my profs, " organisms are delicate reflections of their environment ". Organisms don't get more complex, they adapt to environmental changes to better suit it. On top of that, you have a misunderstanding of the second law of thermodynamics. It applies to entities in a closed environment. The Earth, and the various ecosystems which comprise it, is far from closed. Also, pertaining to the point I've made above, environments on Earth are always changing. This is because the Earth is definitely an open environment. Your question of " where did DNA come from? " and the subsequent conclusion of there being a designer is an unfalsifiable assumption, and thus fails one of the major objectives of a scientific theory. I am not interested in nonscientific, unsupported assertions, and the scientific community won't be either, and that's why ID is deemed " pseudoscience ".<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Then your professor admits evolution does not explain the advancement of life, for that advancement constitutes a massive increase in complexity. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>YOU have a misunderstanding of evolution as well. The reason Darwin never used the word " evolution " was because at the time, evolution meant advancement, and that isn't what he meant. No scientifically literate individual will claim that evolution explains the " advancement of life ", because evolution has never claimed such a thing. Like I said, evolution is far easier than people think ; all it is is a change in allele frequencies in a population. A large punctuation may occur, and that's probably what you're talking about, and that would account for your misunderstanding. The implications of evolution are far reaching, and they are based on the basic principle that I've mentioned.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I doubt that. Good. I noticed he spent an inordinate amount of time on scenarios involving diversity between homologous populations living in isolation from each other ( speciation in progress ) imagine that :p Glad to know I'm scientifically literate. Observe the following logic : 1. Life has advanced greatly from a single celled organism 2. Evolution is the process by which a single simple ancestor generated all known life. 3. Evolution is the process which advanced life greatly. 1 + 2 necessitates 3, if 3 is false than either 1 or 2 must be as well. Claiming 1 is false is akin to that something is nothing ( clear contradiction ) XXXX coming up in other threads. Leaving only 2. What has my so called ID, creationist theocratic, ignorant self been asserting about evolution all this time? 2, apparently the only thing a scientifically literate person can think <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Evolution is not a process which advances a species from generation to generation. Nor would I argue, that species are becoming more advanced, via evolution or not, with the exception of the first couple million years of multicellular evolution. The only reason I am saying this is to illustrate how deeply uneducated you are when it comes to evolutionary theory. To think that my professor, and other evolutionists would claim that evolution is a process of improvement within a species from one gen to the next would be a misunderstanding of evolutionary theory, the argument for evolution and a sheer lack of education on your part.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>As demonstrated by IC analysis. Sounds like ignorance speaking there, there has been advancement for a very long time. Mammals aren't just fancy shaped lizards, we're superior to most cold-blooded life as can be seen clearly both in the present and in the fossil record. ROFL, well you have two audiences for that ; you've got the evolutionist who've already decided to ignore or quit on me ; and then you've got me. You're not doing a very good job on me, and those evolutionist are already convinced. Yet for hundreds of pages self-described evolutionist refused to accept my conclusion which was just that, because indeed they did think evolution explained the advancement of life.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7005_33_31__35_40_41_43_45_49_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>what a dumb post. You contribute nothing.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Funny.... that exact same comment can be made about every single post you've made on this and the many other forums you post on. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>So what are all these forums?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Are you actually, seriously, going to try to play dumb here? Let's see - You once posted on Internet Infidels Discussion Boards ( IIDB - remember your " Butterfly Wombs " fiasco there? ), and eventually were banned from there for infractions of the rules - then you came in under the sockpuppet handle of " YourWorstNightMare ", and then rather dumbly revealed that you were really " Supersport " who had been banned ( right in your first post, I might add ) ; Richard Dawkins Foundation Forums ( RDFF ) ; TheologyWeb ( TWeb ) ( with a choice post of yours ) ; Darwin Central ( where you lasted less than a day ) ; and Christian Discussion Forums ( known as CARM.org ). Just to name a few. Edit : Looks like T.Q. already beat me to calling you on your bull, but as I went to the trouble to look up several places you actually posted ( already knew about IIDB, and CARM, as I post there ), I'll leave them up for everyone to investigate. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yeap, I had about a 2 week stint at Secular web... a 2 - days stint at Darwin Central -- both atheist forums who banned me for nothing. I have not regularly posted at the richard dawkins forum ( not banned ) in many many months.... I also no longer post at TheologyWeb... ( not banned ) Nowdays I mainly post here and at Carm. What exactly does it matter though? I guarantee you most everybody on here posts at different forums as well. Quite honestly the only reason I visit this forum on occasion is to read WW's posts.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You asked what forums ( playing dumb of course ), and you were given an answer that shows we won't tolerate your playing dumb ( A. K.A. lying - rather un-Christian, isn't it? ). Ah, they banned you for nothing, eh? I invite everyone to go to those forum and use the search function to look up SS's posts there ( by Secular Web he means IIDB, I believe ), and then the notices of his banning and the reasons. I note you ignored that you attempted to come back at IIDB under the handle " YourWorstNightmare ". <br><b>S1:4-  </b>um... don't you think if I actually did something specific to be banned they would have said it? But no, they list like 5 things, thinking / hoping I must have done something wrong. Not only that but I get banned for life... no suspension of a few days or a week -- total ban for life. Yet they have those foul-mouthed jokers on that site who do little more than call names and engage in a constant barrage of personal insults because that's all they've got to support their nonsense theory. Please notice I'm not banned from this forum after many many months. Don't you think if I didn't know how to act it would show up here? And I was just being honest when I went back on under a different name -- if they wanted to ban me again, then so be it.... which they did. What exactly is your point? The Darwin Central place banned me before 2 whole days for nothing but debating the issue. They obviously did not want me around.... but gave no real reason for banning me.... they're just chickens. Since you like following my movements, why don't you respond to my latest OP : http://www.christiandiscussionforums...ad.php?t=60848<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Yeah. I totally believe you. Dude, I was there on IIDB when you were posting your spam and other $ hit. As I said before, everyone is invited to go and actully look at your posts and such. I like how you admt to using different usernames now. Wonder what other handles you use here. Archie perhaps? Nah, that'd be too obvious. Wascally I suppose, would be a more sensible assumption. Then there was that whole BlackWodin poster back around February or so ( and several other new posters ) that were your loyal cheerleading fans. Too bad you got banned under them, eh SS? Ah, but I have. I don't use the " ShadowPikachu " handle there - I only use that name on here. Hint : I'm right there on page 1.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8462_5_4__7_9_11_17_18_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>In fact, the " Scientific Method " originated from the idea that the Physical Universe operates on rational physical laws because the Creator did it in logical fashion. What did we have b4 that? " Dragons eating the moon during an eclipse '? Angry gods causing volcanoes to erupt? Apollo racing his fiery chariot across the sky every day?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And yet now we have returned to a faith-based view of the universe that relies on a Creator acting illogically ( read : deliberately fabricating a false version of reality, with ( for example ) light from the stars sped up in order to reach earth in time ) in order to work. I can't help but feel that some of us have moved backwards. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I agree. From what I have heard it was the " Church " that declared the earth to be flat. On the other hand - The Bible talks about the "... circle of the Earth "!!! [ Do not believe man is another adage attributed to the Bible. ] :) Not to mention that the "... the Earth hangeth on nothing ", in Job - - contrast that with the superstition of Atlas holding the earth on his back. [ Even as a child I remember wondering " What is Atlas standing on? :) ] Does anyone remember if Atlas's earth was flat or spherical? The picture is always spherical in modern times.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I can't remember. From what I can remember, however, ancient greek orrerys ( heliocentric models of the solar system ) have been found. A quick visit to wikipedia agrees with me. A slightly longer visit to my bookshelf confirms it with a name - ( link to wikipedia again because I'm to lazy too type the relevant quotes ). The Greeks knew. While faith may inspire scientific progress, blind faith - in this case the unfaltering assumption that your particular translation of the bible is the correct one - tends to stunt it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>There is no doubt that a lot of cultures retained a lot of knowledge about our physical universe and how things work. We have no real idea about the science of the anti-deluvian world - but we do know, they remembered how to build pyramids. More than one culture remembered how to handle stone in such a way. We still cannot duplicate how it was done. :) As far as stunting scientific progress with blind faith in bad ideas, I agree. How much progress was stunted with the idea of pangenesis? then later " mutations " providing new and useful genetic information? In my world - The Bible is true until it is proven wrong. Then it is no longer the Bible.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You do know that this has been directly observed, yes? Panda Shepherds are a good example... To use your analogy, and from a theistic evolutionist point of view - the bible provides the knowledge. The interpretations of that knowledge should provide wisdom - but only if those interpretations are correct. The bible is the bible is the bible - be it metaphorical or factual. It's the various interpretations thereof that are proved or disproved - and once one interpretation has been disproved, why cling to it? Your only reason is blind faith. The flat earth, geocentrism, and now creationism... all are based on incorrect interpretations, and all are observably false. To use a favourite quote ( paraphrased ) of mine - " The greatest triumph of science over religion was not evolution, or in education. It was in the 17th century, when churches started putting up lightning conductors ". <br><b>S1:4-  </b>This is another example of a mutation doing nothing more than scrambling the code that is already there. In this case : Color. No different than 6 fingers on and organism that already had the coding for 5 fingers. We can logically extrapolate that to mean the mutations will eventually evolve or even devolve into feathers or something that is genuinely new? I don't think so. Why are people still clinging to that? Go with pangenesis! It is just as valid yet more interesting. :) Give me just 1 hair follicle that produces a feather or scale as a result of natural mutation then I might consider it. Oh, I forgot, we can now splice genes into organisms and create a lot more hoaxes. Nevermind.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-6561_153_127__156_171_175_181_187_195_199_205_207_211_217_224_225_229_231_232_233_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I partly agree with you, however, I am to stick with creationism, unless a scientist, historian, or somebody else finds an amazing discovery or something of the like that either makes evolution or creationism 100% true. By the way, if God, Allah, or any other " supreme beings " of the like were not considered to be " real ", and just figments of the imagination and such, than why does most of the entire world believe that they are real? Trust me... If God or any other supreme beings were just fantasy, figments of our imagination, or just a mere bedtime story to make people think good thoughts during harsh times, then why are there only very few Atheists compared to followers of supreme beings?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What sort of evidence would convert you? Not only is requiring " 100% proof " asinine, holding the action of the supernatural as the null hypothesis is fallaciously illogical ( i.e. God of the Gaps fallacy ). If the Christian God is real, why do two out of every three people reject it? See why this doesn't work? Your approach is another fallacy, argumentum ad populum ( appeal to the people ). If the planets really do revolve around the sun, how come Galileo was the only one who believed it? I guess the planets didn't revolve around the sun until that last person needed to make the majority switched his belief... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You can believe in what you want, and I'll believe in what I want. But there are facts to support each side of this issue.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Oh good. Then you'll be able to explain the human plantaris muscle with a creationist worldview. I look forward to your reply. While you're at it, tackle all the features mentioned here. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>As I said before, you can state all of the facts that you want, but I am never going to believe the evolution theory, unless the " puzzle " is completed and official...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So all this blustering and yet you admit that you cannot be convinced... unless something amazing happens. So I ask what it would take, and you say that you cannot be convinced... unless something amazing happens. You already believe stuff without " the ' puzzle ' [ being ] totally and officially complete. " In fact, you disbelieve things that you're told by your own religion are perfectly acceptable. In science, nothing is totally and officially complete ; we keep looking for answers to new questions, and for you to treat this as if it's a bad thing really goes to show that some people have their outlook on life bass-ackwards. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Put it this way, there's not enough time in the world to prove how right I am and how wrong you are and vice-versa. I'm giving up here and there, not because I lost the debate, but because this issue is wasting to much of my precious time and I could be doing something more constructive, as could you. We could argue about who's right for hours on end, but it's not going to get us anywhere.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>There's certainly not enough time in the world to prove yourself right ; that simply can't be done when one's position is wrong. Arguing would get somewhere if one would listen to the arguments. Instead, you are desperately clinging to comparing the steel Titanic with a gopher wood ark, arguing that genotypes and individual genetic codes are different, and insisting that you know more as a canard-swallowing 7th grader than degreed professionals. I generally dislike ripping into 7th graders, but you've earned the treatment you've gotten here today. Sadly for me, you're further supporting evidence that indoctrination starts young and is terribly hard to overcome. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I'm not saying that I know more then degreed professionals. But what goes around comes around... You're just an ignorant that failed to listen to a 7th grader...<br><b> S2:5-  </b>That's hilarious. I listen to 7th graders all day. You're one more, except you don't listen to the credentialed person trying to teach you. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>What are you, a teacher? If so, then shouldn't you be correcting papers or something?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Aren't you a student? Shouldn't you be studying or something? From what we've seen here, you certainly should be... You, on the other hand, have no idea what my workload is. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>I finished all of my 8 assignments in school.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>Then you have plenty of time to study biology. Hop to it. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Why would I need to study about biology when I already know the basics about it? I don't plan on majoring in biology or genetics in college, so what's the use to study beyond the basics? I am planning on majoring in either Law or Journalism.<br><b> S2:8-  </b>But you clearly don't know the basics. Two people very familiar with seeing waffling and BS on papers saw right through your blubbering about Neanderthal DNA. You have a plan already? You're in 7th grade. There's a wealth of knowledge for you to obtain before you should even be thinking about your college major. Maybe when you learn something about biology, you'll really like it. The Biblical version you've been taught is really quite boring. <br><b>S1:9-  </b>I was not taught the Biblical version of biology... And yes, I already know what I am going to major in, because of the fact that I really like writing poetry, such as haiku and free-verse, and Law just excites me with the courtroom suspense,. etc. I don't plan on becoming a biologist anytime soon. Science for some reason does not excite me, even though I get A's in Science.<br><b> S2:9-  </b>I'll venture a guess as to why science doesn't excite you : you don't know or understand enough of it. You think that those " problems " with BBT are actually problems, you think that there's no good evidence for evolution, and you think that there's evidence for creationism ( even though you can't provide any ). There's nothing wrong with not loving science, and there's nothing wrong with loving things other than science. But deciding by age 13 the direction you want your life to head is -- shall we say -- premature. <br><b>S1:10-  </b>Science, like biology, physics, chemistry, genetics, ecology, anthropology, and medicine don't really interest me. Although I spark some interest in psychology, because it would be very interesting to discover the mysteries of the human mind in one way or another.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8549_122_121__123_125_128_129_130_132_133_134_135_136_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Accipiter, all I think I come across as is right? did you mean to say, all I think is I come across as right?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yes I did. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You don't come across as right, most of what you say doesn't make sense.

It was a question to accipter, asking why he would want to know if I believe in God, i.e. what point was he going to try to make. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Examples? Here is an example, does the universe have a center? After you say yes, you are then no longer worth wasting time on. It's like you want to argue about mathematics but you never learned what numbers are.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well yes, that is impossible because we will always look for similarities to knowledge we already posses. If you had said it meant the ability to come to a conclusion absolutely independent of emotion I have done that and I know it is possible. I didn't think you did, you'll know if I think something is an insult because I will either ignore it, make a snide comment, or simply type ad hominem in bold face. Funny that two evolutionist can't even agree on what to believe. Yes Bang GOTCHA! stop wasting time :) Now that you have spent yourself on that little effort do you mind if I go back and look up the thing you said which actually was false and revealed you were an intellectual fraud? Or trying to argue about yogurt, without actually tasting milk.... <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The overwhelming preponderance of evidence says no, but you say yes? Who's on your side, god?

Oh no caught me without a collective! In my world truth does not flow from mere authority. Or should I say it does but authority is derived from reason. How many will it take :p I would not like to be compared to accipiter either, but in this case you are both trying to categorize me for purposes I am absolutely sure are irrelevant. I don't care for the spin but that is what happened. All evidence points to the fact that the universe is not static and therefore not eternal.

A fossil being pushed up a mountain by force of a tectonic plate would not stay intact. Are you saying that a foot print above a fossil is evidence? And the archaeologists float over the ground as they uncover it? The instant that material is compacted around a fresh body and there is an adequate amount on top, it has the potential for fossilization. Thought it was more like 10,000 years? Certainly not species eliminating, but there is no difficulty in saying a flood would kill many of the " advanced " animals in the area. Decay is not the same for all isotopes. Elephants are mammals so they have more body fat. Of course we do not have too many living cold blooded animals of such size to check the proportion. * sigh* Apparently not...<br><b> S2:1-  </b>In the same place???? A mountain being formed after the fossils were means you don't need to push them up it. Oh I see, the fossils that were not possibly buried in the great flood were buried before it? That is apparent. You couldn't have any support for that except the exact same inference that paleontologists use on dinosaurs on the premise of common descent. Yes we do, the animal is question was not significantly larger than a crocodile. and the blood vessel evidence was conclusive, far more than the inference made about their evolutionary connections with cold-blooded reptiles. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>yes. A match and a similarity are two very different things and cannot be compared in this instance. does it teleport? It must get up there some way because you say there was no great flood. Do you know how fossils are formed? A " fossil " of a foot print is not and cannot be possible. Now if a person steps in mud and it dries it is not a fossil ; it also could have occured at any time. I see them at the park all the time here. Comical, but untrue. You see, we can see my claim at work ( elephant begets elephant begets elephant begets elephant begets elephant begets elephant etc... ), while evolution's claim is poor speculation ( monkey begets some-wierd-in-between-thing begets man ( or something similar )). Again, are all hearts the same?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Do you realize the odds of that happening? It got up there because it was raised as the mountain was raised. The mountain did not form and then have the fossils pushed up it, the fossils were always on top as the altitude of the earth they were in was raised. I don't remember saying fossil footprint but if I did it was sloppy short hand. Really, what evidence do you have that dinosaurs had less body fat than mammals? I already answered no. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Do you realize the odds for life evolving? When you claim those to have worked out, my claim is certain. But the mountain was raised by force. This force is exerted on the area that the fossil is. It is not so structurally sound as to take that and not collapse. Reptiles do not have very much. ( unless you would say science cannot prove it ) Then how is it evidence?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I was thinking they called that ' petrified ', I knew that fossils were not actual bones but for some reason I was thinking that it was linked to biological remains. If you mean spontaneous generation ( unguided mutation ) it's practically impossible. The unlikelihood is several times greater than needed before an event is considered impossible. That however has absolutely nothing to do with my question or the invalidity of claiming coincidence in the case of ERV's Do you see large rocks on mountains fartingle? How did they get up there without being crushed? Oh that's right rocks are hard and being lifted up through the air at a miniscule fraction of a nanometer per hour is not all that stressful. So you look at their fossils and on the similarities with reptiles you infer that the parts of the body you cannot investigate were similar to reptiles? All hearts do not need to be the same for some to be similar, and indeed for their shapes to have a very specific implication. If a doctor looked at a heart scan noticed a tumor but said to himself " are all hearts the same? well than how is this abnormality any evidence? " <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You are again neglecting the material start of the first life. If you accept the chances of evolution as obviously possible, then to say that humans and apes share ERVs without common ancestry is simple because it is far more likely. Do these rocks have large, abnormal empty spaces inside of them? They are not just being lifted through the air. It is like this : ___ --> / \ not ___ --> _ - ' - _ On more than just the size of an organ. Otherwise scientists have made up most of what we " know " about dinosaurs. That is looking at a similarity in the same species. They do not have any of the supposedly warm blooded dinosaurs to check if they are right so it is all a shot in the dark.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>It wasn't rock when it was stepped on. You are neglecting that we were not discussing the material start of the first life in that strand of the argument and you changed the subject, which is equivalent to a red herring. Perhaps but it is still practically impossible. Your attack on ERV's is invalid. Common descent is a fact. I do not, however ; miss the irony of using an appeal to odds against evolutionist premises The rocks that are bearing the stress are not relatively ' surface ' sedimentary rock. Can you please answer the question, yes or no? Then so is saying dinosaurs are cold-blooded based on the similarity to reptiles. Further the similarities between warm blooded and cold blooded creatures over a large array of body shapes and sizes still indicates that one could tell the difference by the shape. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>So you are saying it sat around undisturbed so long that the ground hardened into stone while preserving the shape? I forgot that can't bring up certain points with certain people. ( even though I started the thread on stating positions...) Have they even done exact studies as too how often an ERV is planted and how many variations there are? If you find something that says yes, did anyone check the results or repaet the expirament? Again with the " it's a fact because someone told me so " arguement!!! Just because someone said that ERVs prove common descent does not make them right. You side-stepped my point about the cavities that fossils create. Technically, I inferred the answer. I then just moved on to specify points. I can never say anything I am not sure of is a fact ( unlike an evolutionist ). I cannot prove what they were like because I have no living specimen. If the theory was based on body shape and all such things, then perhaps you would have a point. Only problem is that it is based on the heart only, correct?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-4455_12_6__15_23_26_51_64_76_77_4<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You are right. In fact, I looked up Mendel in wikipedia and found out I was wrong on more than one account. Mendel didn't predate Darwin at all... they were contemporaries. ( High school biology is much too far away for me to try to make educated assertions on this subject. ) I need to read more on this before making further comments. So, back to my question... what scientific breakthroughs has evolution given us? 1. Medical testing on mice and monkeys.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>A question for you, ender _ krum. Does your above statement matter? Evolution is worthy knowledge alone as an explaination of the history of change in life on this planet. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I am asking this question because in the clip ( available here ), Dr. Larson was upset that a theory which has accomplished " all the breakthroughs in medicine and biotechnology... over the past hundred years " be put on the same level as non-scientific theories. He was the one that emphasized this... not me. I am merely trying to flush these advancements out.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I'm not convinced that Larson was attributing " all the breakthroughs in medicine and biotechnology... over the past hundred years " to evolution specifically but more too the scientific method as a whole. In this regard he is 100% correct to be upset that ID be given equal standing to a process that has built our understanding and world. See above, but I reiterate my initial point : why does it matter if evolution has contributed nothing to scientific advancement except an understanding of the nature of life over time and space? That is a question I would like you to answer. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>But he did... did you watch the video? Seriously? Then what is the difference between evolution and mystical creationism? This view also presents a " an understanding of the nature of life over time and space. " But again... this is how he differentiated evolution from the other two views presented. I did not make this question up, seriously, watch the clip.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Off course, but for your benefit I've transcribed the section that you are citing : So I don't think that it is unreasonable to assert that Dr Larson was refering to the scientific method as a whole as the source of the breakthoughs he gives. Perhaps if you could produce some of Larsons opinion on the matter at greater length rather than a few minutes of soundbites on a somewhat combative discussion show we might see if your interpretation is accurate. I think it isn't for the reasons I've given. " Mystical creationism " is based upon supersitition and belief / faith in that which has no supporting physical evidence. The scientific view is based upon observation, analysis and interpretation of the real and tangible. If you think the former is somehow more valid than the latter in this instance I'd be interested to hear why. See above. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>First, I guess we simply disagree about whether he was referring to evolution or science in general. I thought he was speaking about evolution, but I guess I could be wrong. To address your comments above, originally you said " why does it matter if evolution has contributed nothing to scientific advancement except an understanding of the nature of life over time and space? ". My point was that many worldviews give " an understanding of the nature of life over time and space, " many which are false. What is important is if evolution proves to be scientific... rather than simlpy a way of understanding life.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>An usual assertion to suggest that evolution needs to be proven to be scientific. Evolution is a product of the scientific process - I don't think there is a reasonable arguement against that - and as such is inherently scientific. So I think we confidently can set it apart from faith based interpretations of the development of life over time. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>An unusual prinicple, that a theory need not be proved. Anyways ( though the survival / sexual aspect of body hair is a facinating topic ), I am still curious as to whether speciation is reversable. Also, an example of speciation given above was field and house mice. Could one artificialy ensimenate between these groups? thx</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8423_17_16__19_20_21_22_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>How is the observation that the fish are dead incorrect? The observations were never wrong, the conclusions drawn from it were. The theory of evolution mindset caused scientists to state that they were extinct. And guess what happened?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Technically it's not. The fish represented in the fossils are indeed extinct. The two species that exist today that are superficially similar differ in genetics representation and some anatomical functions. The Coelocanth of the fossils and the two species of Coelocanth are not the same. As much as you wish to pretend they are the same, you'd have to deny genetics as well as anatomical differences. It would be like saying that the shellfish in the lower part of the cliffs of Dover are the same as the ones half way up because they look similar. Are they? No. But that's what you're doing. And your point is? Just because one conclusion was wrong doesn't make the whole theory incorrect. I'd apply that to creationism but you will never defend your belief. At least here. The TOE did no such thing. The lack of existence for the species caused people to believe they they had died out. The same observation for dinosaurs. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The " I said so " argument is getting old. Simply saying that the two are completely different doesn't make it so. I never said a conclusion was wrong, I said a prediction was a massive failure. The scientists stated that it was extinct millions and millions of years ago based on the ToE mindset. A young earth model would not have come to the same conclusion.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Indeed. You really should stop using it. Indeed. You really should stop using it. Prior posts have pointed out that the fossil and modern fish are quite different. Furthermore, your own link states there are two species that branched from the original. Are you now going to deny the links you posted in support of your original argument? And what prediction was that? All the observation concluded that the species was extinct based on the fossil record and lack of any live specimens found. What did evolution predict? What mindset? Explain to me how evolution has any real relevance here. If I saw a fossil of small dinosaur, and then found no evidence for their existence now, how am I applying evolution? Barrel Scrapping in progress! Actually a YEC model would suggest they all died during the flood, and therefore would be extinct as well. Furthermore, YEC also results in all life in the ocean aside from some bacteria being killed from changes in salinity, reduction in oxygen content, blooming of bacteria from the massive releases of decomposition nutrients and a massive change in distribution of heat and nutrients due to salinity changes change how currents flow. There are some real big problems with YEC without even considering how it looks at current species. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You stated that the fish represented in the fossils are extinct. That is clearly false, despite some minor changes. my link agrees with me learn to read Because of the theory of evolution, scientists stated that they were extinct MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO. Wrong. You're assuming that God wouldn't be able to alter conditions so that fish can survive. Your argument = insanity<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Minor? Did you even look at the pictures presented earlier? ( I know the answer to that ) Hardly " minor. " The fish in the fossil is extinct. The fish which has divided into two different species we see today is not the same organisms. No, all it does it says is they found something they believed to be the same. Further on in your link it goes on to tell about the second finding of a similar but different species with different traits. People can read your links and see your claims are refuted by your own links. No, your link DOES NOT agree with you. I say so isn't working. How is the TOE relevant here? If you saw something that was in a fossil and didn't see it anywhere on the planet, would you think it would still be alive? I was wondering when we'd get around to that. It was only a matter of time before you resorted to the argument of : MAGIC! How is my argument insane when it cites your own links and doesn't rely on unprovable Gods that use magic?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8423_2_1__4_5_6_7_9_11_14_23_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The coelacanth, according to fossil records, and according to evolutionists, allegedly went extinct millions and millions of years ago. Until they were found alive. Coelacanth - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia As if this should be any surprise. The theory of evolution mindset once again contradicts observable science.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>There is just one thing however. The coelacanths found are different from those in the fossil record. Further, ALL evidence pointed to them being extinct, until we found other evidence, and we changed it. And, to top it off, the article says NEARLY extinct, not COMPLETELY. Although, this article was of course written after the coelocanths were re-discovered. Of course, this has absolutely nothing to do with the theory of evolution, which explains the mechanisms responsible for the change of allele frequencies in populations over time. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>They do not differ in any significant way. The living species today closely resemble the fossils. The prediction was made based on the mindset that everything evolved from a common ancestor over billions of years. Furthermore, it was based upon the fossil record, which is supposedly shows how everything evolved.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Yes they do. Modern Coelocanth : Modern Coelocanth No they don't. Fossil Coelocanth : Fossil Coelocanth No, it was based upon the fact we hadn't seen one, yet there were fossils of them. Then when we did see the descendants of the fossils and it got changed, that's how science works, when better data is found, the theories are changed. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>A model of a live fish and fossils of a fish are going to be significantly different under any circumstances. There was a gap in the fossil record, scientists looked it at it, and using the theory of evolution mindset, automatically assumed that it went extinct millions and millions of years ago. But of course, it was absolutely wrong. A prediction was made based on the theory of evolution and it was absolutely wrong. Simple.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes, and you know why? Because it evolved. No. They looked at the fossil records, and found fossils up until a certain point in time. After that no fossils were found, and nobody had seen the thing. Now, what conclusion can we draw from this? Or are you suggesting dinosaurs are also still alive, even though nobody's seen them? It has nothing to do with the mindset, and everything to do with the available data. Once better data became available, it was changed. Yes, but we had no way to tell until we found them again, now had we? The prediction was NOT made based on the theory of evolution, but on the fact that there were fossils up until a certain time, then there were no more fossils and nobody had seen the thing. What's so hard to understand here? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Apparently you think that fossils evolved into models.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No I don't. I know animals evolve, and this leads to morphological change. Thus, when a fossil is found, it will be different from a species living today. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>You replied " because it evolved " when I said " A model of a live fish and fossils of a fish are going to be significantly different under any circumstances.

Let's look at his entire paragraph ; There's NO QUESTION he was referring to all men of God. You and electrolyte's dishonesty has just been laid bare. That, combined with all electrolyte's babbling, is making this thread even more fruitful than I thought it would be. P.S. ( Hi _ It's_Me ~ sics ~ me sometimes, just like you used to. Just thought I'd do it to Kenneth Miller once. He left out the word " it ". It wasn't much fun though - I don't need to do it to divert attention from the points being made ) Without Genesis, ( there's no Genesis with Kenneth Miller ) exactly where did original sin originate? They both concern actual event ( s ) of the past. There really is a connection. A rejection of Genesis also rejects much of the rest of the Bible, as vouched for by Jesus, the Prophets and the Apostles. Where would those moral lessons be? What's left of the Bible after theistic evolution gets done editing it?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>No, there's NO QUESTION that he was saying that all men of God promote those particular religious claims. And you wonder why I won't agree not to point out your lack of sixth grade reading comprehension skills... Rather than just stop there, I thought I'd take this opportunity to reveal still more of marc's hilarious " logic. " marc's entire tirade in this thread is meant in part to show that Miller is not a True Christian   . However, Miller is a mainstream Catholic. This would make Catholicism non-Christian, yet marc's argument here is that Catholic priests are clearly " men of [ the Christian ] God. " In order for marc's argument to hold water, Catholicism needs to be both Christian and non-Christian. Bravo, marc! <br><b>S1:2-  </b>How do you know that, because he says he is? Is that all the proof you need? I can't find proof that mainstream Catholics reject the book of Genesis. His book cover has several reviews from " science " interests, yet not a single one from a Catholic, or Catholic authority. Amazon.com s reviews of the book has not one review from a Catholic. I wonder what Catholics actually think of him. In order for your argument to hold water, you'd have to show me an authoritive Catholic source that endorses his book.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Let's take a look at the sentence again : He wasn't separating the idea because the idea is common. The label of " preacher " is not. As pandion points out, you almost have a point here. The question is whether or not Miller's beliefs are representative of those of mainstream Catholicism. Can you find damning inconsistencies between Miller's religious beliefs and mainstream Catholic beliefs? Let's presume that I sunk time into finding said source. You'd just yell loudly that whatever organization I found is really a secret bunch of evil, anti-Christian atheist sympathizers who can't be regarded as a reliable source, as evidenced by nothing but your whim. I only call you a liar without explanation when you've repeated the same lie so many times that my explaining it for the umpteenth time is a waste of time : you ignore it every time, and everyone else has read it already. You instead want a free pass to call Miller a liar merely because the technicalities of his beliefs differ from yours. Gee, how do you think you fellas came up with all those Protestant sects like yours anyway, marc? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>His only source of the idea was " preachers ". He wasn't separating preachers and priests either, because it was a common idea among both of them. Yes. http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05655a.htm You've come nowhere near showing Miller to be a " mainstream Catholic ", or showing a Catholic endorsement of his book. Accepted Catholic sources are easily recognized. " New Advent " is one of them. The atheistic belief that there was no fully formed first man is more than just a technicality. Technicalities, nothing nearly as drastic as some of Miller's harmony with atheism.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Your own words say it, but you still ignore it : the commonality is the idea, not the label. Shame on me for not telling you to use a source that wasn't from the early part of last century. Seriously, marc, is that the best you can do? The Catholic Encyclopedia is from the 1910 s. That's pathetic. Here's some updated information : Pope John Paul II, Message to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences on Evolution, 22 Oct 1996 Pope John Paul II, " Cosmology and Fundamental Physics, " 03 Oct 1981 Looks pretty Miller-like to me. See, now you can call JPII a phony, too, but that won't change the fact that he was the pope, and that Catholics hold the pope to be infallible. See above. Your source is damn near a century old. Modern Catholicism harmonizes with Miller's views. So now Catholics are atheists...

Where does this behaviour stem from? Were we like this from the beginning? Or is this a learned behaviour? There are as many variations on creationism as there are on evolution, one for every persons point of view. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Lots of things : anger, fear, fun, boredom, intelectual challenge etc. It is likey a bi-product of our evolving social cohesive behaviour. There are a few creation websites out there that affect the opinions of most creationists we see coming through here. There are actually very few variations on creationism ( at least here ).<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I am a creationist, but I believe that a literal interpretation of the bible would be a bunch of hogwash. I believe that there was a big bang. I believe that life evolved over millions of years, and I believe that there is life elsewhere in the universe. But I also believe that God had a hand in the big bang, and the evolution of the universe wich includes biological evolution. I use this comparison a lot, but a computer is a complex piece of equipment wich would not exist without intelligent design. the computer is being refined by its creators even today and becomming more complex along the way. I am confident in assuming that the computer is evolving as a lifeform does. It cannot evolve without its creators help though, and would never have existed in the first place without a creator. Then you take a look at a lifeform and how complex the design of even the simplest ones are. I think that there is a designer, and he / she is constantly refining his / her design. And I think that if you were to see the individual views of the creationists, instead of lumping everyone that believes there is a supreme being into one group, none of them would be identical. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>This is the same as you claiming to be an American. Yes you live in North America so could call youerself an American. But the term means a " citizen of the USA 2 to most people, so your use of the term would be confusing. Likewise, the term " creationist " means ( to most that get involved in the debate ) a person who takes the bible literally and believes that their god knocked the world up in seven days some 6,000 years ago. Then your confidence is misguided. There is no comparison between biological evolution and the evolution of computers : they are chalk and cheese. The real killer difference is that computer design borrows ideas from other " unrelated " computers, which simply doesn't heppen in nature. There may be a creator and it may well influence the evolution of life. It does so through the use of evolution though, not " intelligent design ".<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I live in north america, and in no way do I consider myself to be an american, I AM CANADIAN and I am proud of that fact. And yes I do believe that God influences the evolution of life. That is what I am getting at. And my comparison with computers was used as an example of a designer having a hand in the evolution of a creature. The first computers were simple, yet enormous. Now they are complex and compact, kind of like prehistoric creatures, and todays creatures. Not that a computer could be considered a creature. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Then you are not a creationist by any normal use of the word. If life was designed, it was designed using evolution, not classical " building block " design. Computers are designed using classical " building block " design. Your " size " comparison also doesn't work : the largest living animal that has ever lived is the Blue Whale. It is still alive today. There have been some experiments using evolution methods to design electronic circuits for example. They, just like life, bear no resemblance to classically designed objects. They are like life : they look deceptively simple yet we generally do not have a clue how they really work.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I believe in an event of creation, and believe there is a god.

There were atheists long before Darwin you realize. Its perfectly possible to be an atheist and not even be aware of Darwins work since atheism only requires that one not believe in Gods. One can reach that belief easily without any knowledge or invocation of evolutionary theory at all. They are not linked in that way. As to SS you are also incorrect.

You'd be very suprised how easily one actual Christian can recognize another one.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Tsk tsk my friend do you not know that Darwin published in 1850 and there were many many convinced atheists in say 1840, and in the 1700 s ( for example Thomas Paine whose name you may recognize - read The Age of Reason ). They were convinced on the basis of many many empirical observations. And of course science was a well organized enterprise before Darwin and it did not admit of non-material explanations well before his time! And its worth noting that Paley predated Darwin what would he argue against if there were only " illiterate " atheists. Sorry but atheism was present in the ancient civilizations right down to the present date and Darwin was not the basis of such beliefs - it could not have been. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Well, those are good points. But if there were " many many empirical observations " against religion before Darwin, why aren't they more prominent in atheist talking points today? Can you name any of them? I've never heard of any of them. Why is Darwinism and all its various paths practically all todays atheists refer to when backing up their beliefs? No, the secret is how quickly and easily we draw the ire of atheists and evolutionists. If you    re being serious, I    d like you to explain that one. You believe in some of the teachings of Christ, and not much of the rest of the Bible, is that it? I think Kenneth Miller is that way, and some other posters here on 4 foru ms.

To the point that what was a workable ethical philosophy became so larded with OT concepts and with Roman religious concepts ( and organizational structure ) that one could hardly find the original teachings under the overlays of theology and authoritarian structure. Christian athesists discard the theological and structural overlays and go back to the actual original philosophical teachings which were atheist in their content.

Now please go away and get an education, then when you have even the faintest idea of what you are talking about ( which you currently do not ), come back and attempt to debate. It will be for your own good as you are just making yourself look a prat by staying here. Those theories are based upon those facts that you ask for. Get yourself an education and learn those facts. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>A simple school experiment i learnt when i was in 2nd grade at school. Take a bucket and fill it half way up with water then begin to swing the bucket around in the air, tell me what do you have? Its a mighty statement to call a theory like evolution a fact.. You may think you have the facts to back up the theory of evolution, when in actuall fact, without time these facts just turn into kids nusery rimes, just like when the princess kissed a frog to create a prince. So here we are again, without time, evolution is exposed as a joke, and friends when it comes to time, there needs to be a begining and a end, outside of this were do we end up?, cmon people altogether now,!! One more eg of time : When does the day start?, I hope we all got that question right. Now for the next question when does the day finish?, now if one does not believe in creation, then this little pattern will take us way back to the so called big nothing explodeing! It doesant get any more point blank then that!!!. The next question i want to here from you guys is, " were is the evidence that supports the events in the bible? "..<br><b> S2:3-  </b>00:00? Dawn? When you wake up? Just like with ( probably ) every other " start ", there is always an earlier ( or later ) point that can also be seen as the start. So we can go all the way back to the big bang, have we reached the start of all beginnings, or just another false dawn? I'd suggest we stick with questions more of your level, like " what is 1 + 1? " and " what is your name? ". We don't want to confuse you by asking " difficult " questions yet...</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-2174_46_45__48_54_56_65_67_70_72_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I would of been nice if the science teachers at school had of taught me evolution from that view point " we dont know ", instead of " yes we do know " back in the day, it would of shortened the length of time for me to come to know my saviour and king Jesus!..<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I think it's safe to say that you have no basis for saying evolution is wrong and instead just spout religious spam. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I may have no basis to say that evolution is wrong, but i think its safe to say this Clive lad that is saying we should accept the fact that " we dont know " just may..<br><b> S2:2-  </b>We do not know for certain because we have not observed it. All the evidence point to it happening, we simply have not observed it. That is why it remains a theory. However, speciation has been observed and that alone kills the Creationist theory of unchanging animals. Evolution is speciation on a grander scale and scope. Let me know if you don't know what speciation is ;) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Now you are stateing an absalute when you say that a virus becomeing amune to a drug, is the evidence you need to kill off the creationists knowledge of an unchangeing animal. See as for speciation it can only ever remain within a species and without time, the grander scale does not excist, so again all that we are left with is theory. What i want to know is, were you find the room to state an absalute, after starting off your paragraph with the words " we dont know for certain ". See its only speciation on the grander scale that is enough to kill off the knowledge of unchangeing animals, so i think this is the absalute your looking for.. And until you can come up with some solid archeological evidence to support the grander scale, it will only remain a theory.., and never an absalute. The theory of evolution in its own is not a bad thing, its only that when it is presented to our schools and the general public as being fact, that it does to become a problem. Evolution is and always will be just that, theory, and it is only in this way should it be presented<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Wow, you butchered that. " without time, the grander scale does not excist [ sic ] "? Well, duh. Without time, speciation does not exist either. If you accept speciation you pretty much have to accept that Evolution is at least a strong possibility. Evolution is speciation that is happening over a large amount of time, where species change little by little ( which you already accept with speciation ) to the point where they no longer can interbreed with their previous " branch ". Then they are called a new species. Viruses are a bad example because they transcribe RNA - > DNA instead of DNA - > RNA It does kill of the " knowledge of unchangeing [ sic ] animals ". If you accept speciation, you accept that species can change to adapt to their environment. There is nothing, at that point, to challenge that a species will continue to change in the manner Darwin postulates. Agreed, that is why it is the Theory of Evolution. We have not observed it happening. It is presented in textbooks as the Theory of Evolution. It is taught as the best explanation that we have for our existence. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I believe science is a great tool to help us understand that which is observable in the now ( The law of gravity, SPECIATION, medicine and so on ), however to use science to observe that which is not observable like the long periods of time that helps to support the theory of evolution, and i love to stress that word " theory! " would be like trieing to use a spanner to fix a watch.. See i know the evolutionists like to use the word science when it comes to evolution, but the question needs to be asked when it comes down to the period of time that it takes for evolution to work, is it science or is it faith?. Because of science, we know gravity is a fact, because of science we know that a heart transplant is a fact, because of science we know that weather forcasting is a fact, so is it because of science we know that evolution is a fact. This is a little indicator on how when it comes to the time it takes for evolution to work, science needs to take a step of faith!<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Care to make a better analogy? Spanner to watch is a little out there. Science describes what is not observable all of the time. Cosmic strings to atoms to EM radiation, we cannot observe them directly and instead infer that they exist through evidence. You love stressing the word theory? I haven't really disagreed that Evolution is a theory. " evolutionists " ( in the real world we call them scientists ) use the word science because that is the process they use to infer that Evolution happens. The rest of your post is filler. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>All jargen aside the bottom line is that science has no place when it comes to observing the time it takes for the evolution theory to work!!!!!. evolution purely has to place its faith!, in that time!!!! Tell me cosmic strings to atoms to Em radiation, is all this jargen factual, if it is the case, why is evolution only a theory and not fact, you have no place to use that line of reasoning to support the use of science with the period of time it takes for evolution to work!</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10329_72_49__76_79_82_85_87_90_91_92_93_94_95_96_97_98_99_100_101_102_103_5<br><b>S1:1-  </b>My assertion is not that they could be involved with intelligent design. creationism you imbecile.

You are then forced to come up on the spot with a phrase to describe him. " He merely thought that Intelligent Lifeforms came here on space ships and influenced the evolution of Already living cells. " That is like saying " he's not a chef, he merely combines ingredients and prepares them into food ". I have been attempting to correct your mistake, and I know I have failed at that. I have explained quite clearly in this thread post 15 what the relationship between ID and creationism is. You had nothing to say but counter-assertion. You are... simply.. unwilling to consider a term with the meaning of ID. Not you alone, but it was just ' made up '. I am going to enjoy watching you and gansao continue in this artistic battle of... what is it called? It is like sarcastic digs, but also a play off the others words, but it boils down to counter-assertion. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You can't correct a mistake unless one has happened...

ID - certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause Deal with it.

Id'ers Are notorious for being very specific not to mention a Higher Life Form or Supernatural Being as being that " Intelligent Cause " Fact.. A Inanimate Object does not have " Intelligence " I hope you will at least agree. Plus the Known fact that Intelligent Design was brought about by a group of Creationists who were XXXXXX because Creation Science is not allowed to be taught in schools. They have been trying to pass off Intelligent Design as Actual Science yet they fail to produce one shred of Scientific Data to back their theory. Intelligent Design IS neo Creationism.. Deal with that.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Post 15, this thread read it. That is because they foolishly hope that people like you are asking in good faith and want to know the difference. The truth is that even though you know the difference, even though you have practically spelled it out ; you still claim it doesn't exist. What more can a rational person do but sigh in disappointment? I agree, meaning ID implies a designer or agent of intelligence. That is irrelevant even if true. They have a lot of work to do if they are going to match the damage done to young minds by irrational evolution and anthropogenic climate change. Prove it.

Well, you could always stop lying and making inane claims.

Enough it enough. Exactly how many times do you think you can continue to do this before you are banned? Do you have no shame? Noooo, I'm pretty sure I'm sane, so I accept reality as it is, without discarding the bits that don't agree with my preconceived notions. In order for us to be on the " same side ", I would have to pick and chose which bits of reality I happened to agree with, and in which circumstances. This has been pointed out to you amply in this thread by both Peeling and myself ( oops, I mean Electrolyte ) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Let's just agree to disagree TQ.

You called me dishonest again. You want to do that, provide some evidence. You are not walking away. You think callin me a liar for about the 30th time is " trying to avoid a confrontation "? You think me telling you to back up your slander is " trying to provoke one "? Not even close bub. Back it up already, and take your good wishes and stuff them. They mean nothing coming from you. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Like I said, And how do you intend to prevent me from walking away from your irrational attack? Because that is exactly what I am doing. Your threats are meaningless to me.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You know what? You are absolutely pathetic. 1 ) You call me a liar 2 ) I ask that you either provide evidence of my lying ways, or apologize. I provide proof that you, in fact, have a history of lying. 3 ) You then accuse me of trying to provoke you ( uh, you called me a liar, I asked you to prove it ) 4 ) I again say " Prove your allegations or apologize " 5 ) You call me irrational. You are absolutely, completely pathetic. You are an embarassment to any and all who call themselves Christian. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Here is what is so hypocritical once again TQ, but fits perfectly with your M.O. Below is my post from above that has set you off on this tirade accusing me of calling you a liar, when in fact that post clearly say's that you wouldn't recognize the truth if you tripped over it. That statement isn't saying you lie but is saying you don't recognize the truth. Go back and look at the original post if you don't believe me, go on, look. So in effect TQ, this very tirade and current attack by you is evidence of my past claims of your dishonest debating style. You have attempted to irrationally provoke a confrontation with me under the false pretense of me calling you a liar today, as I have repeatedly said I don't want to get into it with you. And now you are attacking my christianity as I am attempting to make peace with you. And in spite of your sorry attitude I still forgive you and wish you well. See how magnanimous I am trying to be with you? :)<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Oh, my mistake, you didn't call me a liar, you just said me and the truth had less than a passing acquaintance and implied I was a liar instead of outright stating it this time. You then, in this very post, state again how I am constantly dishonest. Yeah, I don't know how I ever got the idea that you consistently call me a liar. Once again, will you apologize for constantly slandering me? Or will you just run away again, as you always do when you are completely and utterly embarassed by your complete lack of integrity? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>See, there you go again. You get caught being irrational and attacking me unfairly, and as a result you claim victory, claim it is I who is embarrassed? And it is I who owes you an apology? So no TQ, I don't owe you an apology at all. You owe me one. If you will treat me with the same respect I have been treating you with here, we can finally get along. But as long as you attack me unfairly I will make my points in debates and not go back and forth attempting to answer to childish retorts. Sorry if that doesn't satisfy your demands, but that is how it will be. You see, you don't control this forum or my free will. So once again, be at peace.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Getting you to answer questions, use logic, stop insulting people, and provide evidence are " childish retorts " now, eh? And take your " be at peace " and " well wishes " and cram them. I am absolutely, positively, tired of your ####. You spent the last three weeks lying, insulting, jeering and in every way, shape and form violating the TOS of this site, yet you seem to think that because you haven't done that in the past hour, you're suddenly a golden boy. Guess what Archie? Your actions have repercussions. In other words, when you're a proven liar, fraud, and insult artist, you are going to continue being considered a liar, fraud, and insult artist for a long time to come.

Have you no sense of fair play at all? Or are you just here to troll after me and nit pick every obscure statement I make?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Not in the least. Ripskar did in fact, right here right now, predict the failure of this new publication. There's no question about that, we saw it happen. Your claim that the other website was predicted to fail? We have no evidence of that, you have in fact all but confirmed that you just guessed that such predicitons were made. When you present it as fact. You presented your imaginary data in refutation of Ripskar's prediction, that makes it fair game. Face it, you made something up in a debate and got caught, have the integrity to bow out gracefully. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Again, how incredibly shallow and one sided kronus. With your sense of objectivity and fair play, why aren't you insisting that pandion also justify this statement with links to support what he states as facts? Could it be because you are a, oh I don't know, A HYPOCRITE? Think about it kronus.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>So I guess you don't have the required integrity to admit when you're wrong. No surprise.

I wait with bated breath for you explanation of how genetic plasticity dependent on the secretion of a specific trigger compound by the predator is non-material and involves intelligence, and just how the secretion of similar compounds by the spiky Daphnia which maintain the effect contradicts materialism in any way. Good luck. Consider it a challenge. I leave it up to you to chase the relevant papers down in the literature. I have done it in the past and know what I am talking about. If you simply ignore them I will beat you badly about the head with them as necessary. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>who cares how it works..... when you were in school and answered math problems on paper, did your teacher come around and ask to look inside your brain to figure out what the mechanism was so she could verify how you got the right answer right? No!... the proof was right there in front of her.... who cares how the answer was arrived at. Ultimately life has no mechanism -- at least no scientific mechanism that can be measured. Life goes against science at every turn.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well if you don't know how it works how can you make a claim that it proves your case! If you don't know how it works you have no proof of what you are claiming at all. If I were to say I did not care how the sickle cell trait system and malaria interacted and still used it to prove my case what would your response be? Would you accept my claim without dispute, would it be proof of my contention. No way - you would be on me like a duck on a junebug. You had bloody well care about how systems you claim as proof of a hypothetical mechanism work - else be laughed off the stage at even a grammer school argument! I can see Newton saying well these orbital data prove my point - but I don't care or know how it works!!!!!! High credibility - I think not. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The difference is the results of the experiment are self-explanatory in that it's obvious that the newly-generated structure was a result of an interaction between the organism and predator ( s ). Therefore, randomness is ruled out, which is all that's required to undermine the foundation of darwinism and materialism. How it might have happened might be fun for scientists to sort out, but I have no real interest in it.... partially because it is clear that mental processes were ultimately responsible, and mental processes cannot be fully understood anyway, so why bother?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I did not say the response was random. Indeed its clearly a wide spread non-mutaional process which affects a fair fraction of the population in question. But its also not an evolutionary change is it? Or don't you know ( or care? ) how it works yet? And sorting it out is essential if you wish to make claims about how it works which you are in fact doing. And if you have no interest in the key proof of your argument you are not treating the issue in a serious way are you. Talk about playing games. You apparently prefer to make claims of proof based on things which you know little or nothing about - how easy that must make it - till someone points that out of course. And you think mental processes are responsible yet I will bet that you have never even seen a live daphnia let alone examined ones brain or taught one to perform circus tricks, or coverse! You argument ends of course with the immortal words... So now you admit that its due to mental processes but you have no understanding of those processes and you are too lazy intellectually to examine the very observations which you have oddly enough chosen to make the centerpiece of how you belive life functions. WOW <br><b>S1:4-  </b>not, I'm not lazy at all... I'm just not interested...... I don't even like science. It bores me.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Yes its abundantly clear that you know little or nothing about the subjects of your posts. Ignorance is not a pretty sight. Scientific ignorance is a disgusting one. Deliberate and uncaring scientific ignorance cannot be looked upon without using a mirror of some sort lest ones own brain turn to stone. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>chemist, I may not have a love for science like you do but there is more to life than science -- I know that may be hard for you to digest... but life is more than chemicals and molecules.

I am impressed by your ability to dismiss an argument based on your personal authority ; it shows true arrogance ( or credulity if it is on the collective authority of others ). It is attitudes like this that make the comparison between the leftist manias and religion so easy. Neither of you feel the need to defend ' facts '... Well I will always call that bluff. You don't feel the need because you don't have the ability. Religion has had much more time to learn how to deal with rational people than these sprouts and as far as I am concerned that was a primitive way of saying : " it's a matter of faith ". <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If you don't know maybe you should not have answered it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The question I believed I was answering was this one : " Do you believe there is only one theory offered by the scientific community?

" I certainly know what I believe. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You are incorrect again.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Interesting, just for the fun of it why don't I assert you are the one who is incorrect ( about what I don't know ). <br><b>S1:5-  </b>How do you know?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I don't The only thing I calculated was lower limit on the odds that any particular 20 amino acids are coded for randomly. The way I calculated it was correct. Appeal to infinite odds. An argument from ignorance would be as follows " No one has shown how life could have formed from these chemicals by random chance, therefore it is impossible " He is saying ( I think ) and he is correct to say " It is impossible for life to be formed by these chemicals and random chance, because of the odds involved " What you say to him and you have said to me despretly many times is " nuh uh, it's not impossible because there are SO many ways for life to form or SO many possible novel functions that the odds you calculated are neutralized. That is a true inverse of a appeal to ignorance ; since you believe no one can know all the possible chains of events that might lead to novelty or life there must be enough of them to make it likely. I call it an appeal to infinite odds and I have given you examples where it is applied to other subjects which reveal its invalidity. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Why?......<br><b> S2:6-  </b>I have no reasons to think you would be wrong. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>About what?<br><b> S2:7-  </b>No clue. and that is appealing to preexisting information, you have said it before and I did not ignore you before. It is a temporal fallacy as my point is about where the information is coming from. You were the one who brought up the 20 amino acid number * just admit it you thought that was a simple protein ( and it is compared to most ). You know all the times people pointed out to me there are bigger mutations than base pair changes? The reason those aren't more significant than smaller mutations is because the odds for novelty don't increase and my making that remark you imply the same. You may easily back out from your 20 amino acid assertion but you can't do that and maintain the point it was making about the possibility for novelty. For instance 4000 amino acids may only be 4 base pairs away from novelty, that is not a leap of 4004 amino acids it is of four. Similarly if you have 20 amino acids 18 of which already exist in the proper order the leap is 2 not 20.

I was asking you and other theistic evolutionaries a question.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But if your theology is incorrect, there is no question to answer. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It is true that the question was loaded ; a question never-the-less. So, why did Jesus come to earth? If you think we're descended from ape-like beings, why choose us to save?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well if your theology is wrong, he came to earth the same reason any of us did. He was born here. There may or may not be a God, but he didn    t send anyone to save anyone. But I    ll go along with your question. Maybe the Bible is right in a theological sense. Maybe God evolved us to a certain point where he basically said okay you    ve developed enough for a soul. Then he breathed a soul into    Adam    which could have represented a pair or a group of people. Or it could be as I believe, that we are to the point where we are evolving a soul / spirit as well as a body. I know there are other possibilities but those are the first three that popped into my mind. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Perhaps I should re-word my question.... Why did Jesus come to us? My understanding of theology is that Jesus came to save us, to redeem us for the guilt caused by Adam.... So if you believe in a ' lucky ape ' that evolved a soul or was granted a soul, or whatever... and you're not really answered the question... ( what do you believe ; just given a range of options )... when was the first sin committed? What happened for there to be a need for Jesus?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I understand your question montalban but you don    t understand my answer. Let me see if I can make it clearer. I    m saying your understanding of theology is wrong in my view. Jesus wasn    t the son of God so he didn    t come for any reason. He was just a man with a great message that was way ahead of his time. But he didn    t save anybody from anything. There never was a first sin so there never was a need to be saved from anything. I understand that is not what YOU believe, but it is what I believe. That    s what I meant by maybe your theology is wrong. Does that explain what I am trying to say. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Got it. For you Jesus is some cool dude.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I wouldn    t describe it like that. As I said, I think he was way ahead of his time. I think you are being sarcastic. LOL I have been thinking a lot about our recent conversation and I have taken notice of how many times I use sarcasm or that it is used on me during the day. It averages about 4 times a day. Every time we all get a good laugh out of it. I    m trying to say that sarcasm is a standard part of my conversation in my personal life. I understand that it can be used to insult people, but my culture is using it for fun. Maybe were have a communication problem based on different cultures. I    m also not saying that I never use it to insult or put down something I think is ridiculous, just that normally I use it as a way of just kidding around. And this is regardless of any dictionary definition. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I am not trying to be sarcastic ; but you may have perceived that I was - so I'm sorry for that. And actually reading it again, I'd say it's more akin to being facetious than sarcastic ; and I don't think sarcasm's a valid form of debate... unless you're friends with the other person and you know how they will take it. I also don't mean to be putting words into your mouth - so when I call him a ' dude ' I am trying to ascertain what it is that you think Jesus was doing here.... Also I don't think it's cultural. I am, as I said, highly pedantic. I try to say what I mean. Another poster on another thread has read into my posting of a question some kind of conspiracy or trap. I have said that it's not. And it's not. And you have what is to me a flippant approach. Why'd God send him - just as a messenger / guru? If so, then obviously as a messenger, He's failed, becuase most of us believe He's the Son of God sent here to end death.

Quite apart from that historians do ( arguably to different degrees ) use the Bible as an historical document. This too, the above poster ignores. So, all the evidences in the Bible aren't recognised, blanketly by the above poster. Hence, when faced with such dogged attachment to ignorance, we have to look to their own fields of belief<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Which author of the Bible was alive during the creation of the world, the creation of all organisms, and the Noachian flood? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>God was there. God inspired the Bible's books. He certainly communicated directly with Moses and other prophets. Then Jesus, God Incarnate, talks of God as Father, and Creator etc.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>You've wandered into the completely unverified and unverifiable.

I've got eyewitness testimony from God. Turtleism destroys evolution and creationism. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Crim, you asked me a question. I already know that you won't accept the evidence or that it is evidence. It's well and truly vapid to say you've got testimony from God, because you don't believe in God.

Then we are back to square one.. my original statement that the reason we discuss these issues with you is out of respect for your failings to understand the ' big ' picture... that is, things that exist beyond sciences capacity to describe. So we have to use your limited framework... Science only deals with a limited part of the universe. Did other planets in other solar systems exist before science discovered them?

And actually, you can answer all those questions without taking a literal meaning of the word " day " or the notion that the moon is its own light source. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>how is that? where does the bible say that the earth orbits the sun? if you are refering to " He set the earth on its foundations ; it can never be moved. ", it implies that the set course and bounds and laws that keep the earth in its established place can never change. the orbit of the sun IS the earth's foundation. saying that the earth is set in its foundations doesnt mean that the earth isnt in orbit or rotation, just that it is bound by unchangeable priniciples and parameters the moon is a lesser light than the sun that governs the night. a day consists of an evening and a morning. what in this passage suggests that it is not a literal 24 hour day?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>We are talking about literal translations. MOVED means MOVED. You came up with some apologetic interpretation that redefined MOVED. " It meant something more than it literally said. " That Psalm gives no indication that it should be interpreted in such a way. The other parts are all quite literal. The moon is not a light. Actually, what is " a light? " Is a flame a light? Is a mirror reflecting that flame a light? How literally are we supposed to interpret the passage? If we interpret it as literally as possible, it is factually incorrect. The words " morning " and " evening " could be metaphors for certain eras within the larger era of " day. " In 1984, it was " Morning in America. " You can just interpret it vaguely and metaphorically like you interpreted " moved " and " foundations " above.. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>the word " moved " and " changed " is the same. there is nothing apologetic about using an obvious synonym. the term " not moved " can also refer to the stability of the earth. you insist on associating the word " move " only with motion, when all the time we use the word in different contexts to suggest different ideas. light that reflects off the moon is moonlight. there is no mental acrobatics needed to accept this. a 5 year old would tell you the same thing. oh... so now when its convenient you drag metaphors into it? the word " moved " and " changed " are common synonyms. no metaphorical interpretation or allegorical hijinks involved. similarly an evening and morning in sequence makes up a single 24 - hour day. 6 of these days in sequence ( as counted ) make up a little less than one week. the genesis account makes it quite clear. introducing ideas like " era ", " vaguely " and " metaphorical " is obviously where you start to add to genesis what isnt there<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Then why do you have such a problem with less common usage of the words " day " " morning " and " evening "? when all the time we use the word in different contexts to suggest different ideas The synonym is far from obvious and a bit of a stretch since when reading the word " move " people usually don't think mere " change, " but a change in position. But you are defining the term " a light " differently than I am defining it. I could say that light bouncing off a mirror is mirrorlight. That doesn't make the mirror " a light, " which I define as a source of light, don't you? You are the one stretching the common usage of the word " move " to make the Psalm say something that is not immediately understood when reading it. When a person reads it for the first time with no prior knowledge of astronomy, he would not read " move " as mere " change, " but as " change in position, " by far the most common usage of the word. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>what word would you use to describe the light that reflects from the moon then? you are interpreting the psalm to say that " the world doesnt move ", when it says " it can never be moved ". you take it to imply motionlessness. in reality it simply implies stability. of course we can agrue that they are both valid or invalid interpretations, but it most likely will end up pointless strange enough, i never read that passage and took it to mean that the world doesnt move, or that it is motionless...<br><b> S2:4-  </b>The article A does something in the english language. Without it " light " is the radiation that travels around. A Light is not that. It is the source of the radiation. ( edit-in reading the NIV version of genesis, it only says : Gen 1:16 - God made two great lights-the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. So actually, this interpretation doesn't call those lesser lights the sun and moon explicitly. It may only be refering to there being more light during the day and less during the night. ) No I am reading it literally " it can never be moved. " But you are right about quibbling over the meanings and interpretation of words in the Bible. It is pointless. That is strange.

So god could chose whether he wanted to " save " mankind or not and he chose to do it? If God had chosen not to save mankind, then the human form of himself on Earth would have done what and would have had what purpose? I guess he could have just lived a long life doing parlor tricks and arguing with pharisees... The whole purpose of Jesus was so that everyone could be absolved of sin simply by eating a piece of bread broken on the altar instead of slaughtering a poor lamb on an altar. It's much more economical for large populations. Again, if Jesus was an ordinary human and not god incarnate, then he wouldn't have been able to heal the sick and do all those neat tricks.

Since humans are currently the only known instance of ' intelligence ', then prior to the existence of humans ' intelligence ' was quite possibly not an attribute of the universe. ' Wetness ' is an attribute of water but we wouldn't consider this same attribute in relation to hydrogen or oxygen, nor to their constituent nuclear components. Emergent properties happen. No, according to modern cosmological theories, not even the strong or weak nuclear forces existed at the very beginning of the big bang. The big bang is evidence that our local region of the universe did not always exist. Beyond that one has to say " I don't know ", though several recent cosmological hypotheses ( e.g., quantum loop gravity ) do strongly suggest events prior to the big bang, but not in our local region of the universe. Yes, brains in a vat, the Matrix, and Last Thursdayism are unprovable. That is why science has been so successful - it only deals with naturalistic explanations for naturalistic phenomena. An unconstrained supernatural force can provide an answer for anything ( fossils in the ground, complexity in organisms, etc. ) but will provide an explanation for nothing. Science is in the business of providing explanations - philosophy is down the hall and on your left. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>If the universe existed for an infinite amount of time then the property of intelligence as emerged an infinite number of times before and after the current time frame. Having what to do with what I said? Hypothesis aren't evidence, perhaps that mistake is why you believe in evolution? Anyway you can keep chaining stuff up but a random start event is inconsistent with what we know, so I still say that something has existed forever and it is not any part of the universe we are aware of. Hehe I can't tell a difference between my philosophy and science, it is all knowledge that is gained through non-contradictory inquiry into reality.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I was responding to your use of the word ' incontrovertible '. The standard cosmological model is based on general relativity and it is a known fact that GR breaks down at t =0. At t =0 the big bang was most likely a quantum event, and yes, there are theoretical physicists working on hypotheses to explain what happened at t =0. Given that they are currently only hypotheses I don't think the word " incontrovertible " is warranted. And yet quantum physics tends to be very contradictory, at least to our perceptions. Acausal events happen. A particle can be in two places at the same time. A particle can disappear and reappear in a different location without traversing that distance. And et cetera. Since the beginning of our local universe occurred at quantum levels, I would be cautious about drawing philosophical conclusions based on our macro-world experiences. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It is incontrovertible, there is no explanation for something appearing from nothingness. Then it tends to be untrue. I don't believe that is possible. I do not believe this is true either. Really, does the random appearance of quarks seem less inexplicable than the random appearance of protons or atoms?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Except that it's not. Your PC, DVD player, cellphone, microwave oven, etc. are all built on the principles of quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is the most accurate predictive theory of physics ever devised, accurate to how ever many decimal places that can be measured. That it says many things that are completely counter-intuitive is irrelevant : nature does not have to behave in intuitive ways. Whether you believe it or not is also irrelevant. The above have been theorized, predicted, tested, observed, and measured. If you want more information you can google ' zero point energy ', ' Casimir effect ', ' quantum tunneling ', ' superposition ', etc. Or pick up an intro to quantum mechanics in layman's terms. I don't know what you trying to say with the above..... Edit to add ( pre-emptively ) : Also google up " Bell's theorem ", the testing of which strongly indicates there are no local hidden variables ' below ' quantum mechanics, and thus quantum mechanics is an accurate description.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-540_130_128__131_132_133_134_135_136_137_138_139_140_141_142_143_145_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No. I'm saying that ask a dozen experts and they'll as likely come up with 12 different results in placing them into different categories.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>But, of course, monty completely misses the point. Why am I not surprised? The difficulty in precisely seperating the various fossil skulls above into species or even Genera would be what you would expect if evolution had occurred. The evolution of an ancestral species into one or more descendent species would be very confusing if you had only a few sample specimens from hundreds of generations. However this sort of confusion shouldn't be possible if you accept creationism. Homo sapiens are one kind, chimpanzees are another kind. How could there have been individuals who shared characteristics of both kinds? Despite different opinions from different experts, I'm sure that none of them would claim the Australopithecus africanus skulls are chimpanzees ' skulls, or that the Homo habilis skulls are modern humans ' skulls. And of course it's amusing to note that the creationist " experts " can't even agree amongst themselves which are human and which are ape skulls. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>What I'm saying is that some of these skulls which you might say are ' links ' are in fact just small human skulls... as fitting in with the normal range of human skull size. Also, is that the ' offical ' definition of ' kind '?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You're completely clueless, aren't you monty? There is much more distinguishing a human from a chimpanzee or gorilla skull than size. Here's a hint. Check the link which Lurch provided. Is sample A only a small version of sample N? Is sample I a large case of A or a small case of N? BTW " kind " is a meaningless creationist term. Feel free to provide your own perculiar definition if you are fame. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Clueless? You mean you're talking about chimps and monkeys, and I'm not. I responded to someone mentioning that the skulls are not like any creature alive, now you're talking about apes. I mentioned ' missing link ' as a clue. We are not descended from monkeys and chimps. I was asserting that with skull size, if you line them up, some people will say that the smaller skulls are more primitive, and that you can't use this as a measure ; a number of people will categorise them one way, a number as another. There is no agreement. As to ' kind ' it wasn't I who raised it. Tis a pitty you're so full of hate that you rebuke me for mentioning it, and fail to raise it with the person who did. I merely asked for their definition of ' kind '. Oh, that was you wasn't it? Oops, no wonder you're upset!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>monty, you have been provided with this selection of fossil skulls. Which are the ones that are small human skulls misclassified? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Firstly, please address the issue of ' kind '. Are you now saying that your use of it was wrong or do you have a definition of it? You did get a tad insulting about what you in fact raised.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>monty, " kinds " is a creationist term which has flexible / imprecise meaning. Despite its meaninglessness, creationists include it in their " explanations " of the diversity of life eg. some claim that humans are a different kind to apes. Enough of that red herring. Back to the skulls. Which ones have been misclassified because they are small human skulls? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>a ) YOU were the one who raise it b ) YOU were insulting when I asked you to define it.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Red herring.

Obviously I'm not going to deal with things the way you want, and you're not going to deal with things the way I want. However, I'm sure you'll want to drop a last word on the matter like it's only me who does this :)<br><b> S2:7-  </b>monty fails to put up, again. I wonder if he will shut up, after he withdraws his assertion about small human skulls. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>See! You make an assertion about ' kind ' and don't want to deal with that I knew you were only wanting to point score.<br><b> S2:8-  </b>I've heard all sort of inconsistent definitions of " kinds " from creationists. The only consistency is that they claim that humans are a kind on their own and distinct from all other linving creatures. What's your definition of " kind "? But back to the challenge : Which skull fossils have been misclassified because they are small human skulls?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10660_56_55__58_59_60_67_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Attempting to invalidate your opponents argument time and time again is not a very good debate tactic. Ripskar did indeed offer up a counter argument for the argument " you can't create something from nothing ", issuing the links he posted. The explanation for how QM relates to and counters the argument is within the links themselves. One link even addressed the initial argument directly. On you and ID ; it's clear from that link that you were arguing in defense of ID. Whether that's indicative of you being a supporter of ID is negligable. If I may chime in ; everyone on this forum knows that you argue for some altered view of IC, and every source available will tell you that IC is an ID argument - the argument was conceived by a proponent of ID ; IC is clearly used as an argument to support ID... Again, your view doesn't necessarily plop you into ID territory. You've rather convolutedly explained it to me once before, and I accept that if you say you aren't a supporter of ID, then fine, you aren't.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Invalidate or falsify is the point of debate, but I have not invalidated anything ; I have merely pointed out the lack of argument. I didn't read them, I know the statement cannot be countered rationally and would just as well see ripskar attempt to do so for it was he who's claim sparked my indignance. Pointing out false arguments is something I do all the time. I have done it to local creationist, to pretty much everyone. I am not an advocate of everything. That's like saying arguing against murder makes you a christian because christians condemn murder. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Falsification and invalidation are two methods that can be used in debate if you can, amongst many others. Thus far, I have not seen you apply any method other than attempted invalidation. This is a perfect example, in that one argument was pitched ( you can't get something from nothing ) and Ripskar countered that argument with the links he used that you neglected to read, referencing QM as a source of acquiring something from " nothing ". This is a perfectly valid argument, one in which you attempt to invalidate by claiming that he doesn't have an argument in the first place - something I've seen you do many times. See, using invalidation against a valid argument is not only ineffective, but it makes you look really silly. Ripskar referenced a number of links ; if anything, you are the one who has not developed a counter argument to QM in response to " the fallacy of something out of nothing " ; you've just not bothered to read his argument and then claimed he doesn't have one. Do you see how silly this looks??<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Lol, Nothing | Define Nothing at Dictionary.com. In other words I know it cannot be countered because such would be a contradiction. The statement ' a universe from nothing ' is a contradiction, the best that can be said is ' a universe '. If you think QM can dissolve logic why don't you make the argument, surely if your links made the case you could summarize it here. No, attempting one of those are the only two ways to attack an opponents argument, the rest are informal fallacies. I've said my opponent has no argument many times because many times they do not. Most of the time they blather for a bit with informal fallacies and emotional appeals and then quit. Lol, interesting way you phrased that. Try to invalidate a valid argument, yes that won't work. There are only two possible natures of his links, a description of QM which is in no way applicable to the logic of the original statements ; or some mystical rhetorical maze such as the one displayed recently with databed and the 1 - 1 = 0 equivocation to NULL = ~ NULL <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Oh yea, cause opinion based arguments don't exist, to name one. This is the problem with your arguments. You think invalidating someone's argument is the only way to provide one of your own. However, you can only invalidate someone's argument if that argument is... invalid, in the same way you can only falsify someone's argument if it is false and you can show that it is false. I actually read the links Ripskar posted, and not only did they address the issue ( falsifying your first assertive claim ), but it made complete sense to me, knowing nothing about QM to start with ; all was logical and almost based off of fundamental principles of QM ( and falsifying your second assertive claim ). You're still trying to invalidate Ripskar's argument by saying he doesn't have one when you haven't even read his argument.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It's the only way to provide a counter argument yes. Quite right. No, I didn't read his link ; I'll read any argument he cares to make. If you think QM ' counters ' something like " what came before time? ", and " something can't come from nothing " I will readily agree you know nothing about it. Still waiting for your argument, yours. Nothing is defined as the lack of existence, so yes there is no such thing as nothing. There is a concept nothing but that's all. Nothing = no thing.

Or alternatively PROVE ABSOLUTELY that the sun will " rise " in the sky tomorrow. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>More obfuscation chemist? You know that you're nothing but a XXXX hard who is making huge unprovable and unsupportable assumptions so just vacate and derail the debate rather than simply support what you say happened more than 400 million years ago on a dead planet void of all life. I mean, you speak with such all knowing confidence, surely you must have proof of what you assume happened, dont you chemist? No matter how you slice it, you believe that from the simplest single celled life form cam creatures with organs, limbs, nervous systems and brains that even developed the ability to reason and be self aware. All through RANDOM MUTATIONS. By accident according to your logic. Forget the odds of such diverse and complex life happening by accident and you still have the problem of all this happening by accident in only 400 million years. The best objective minds don't believe such incredible calculations could result accidently in 400 trillion years without some intelligent help.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Nope you left out the key process of natural selection applied to such variability and that makes the process non-random although it remains undirected. And yes with that modification I do believe that life on earth diversified from one or a few primitive common ancestors from evolutionary processes not greatly different from that of NDS. I have no prblem with it - apparently you do. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Oh that's right, I always forget that sticky little term of Natural Selection. But tell me chemist, before any living organism existed, what was there to Naturally Select? Can you clarify that little conflict? How does random mutation which is not really random, even though they have always called it random, encourage natural selection when nothing existed to begin with that was capable of producing life? And more importantly, how do you go to sleep at night knowing that only a lunatic would take the existing evidence and consider it reasonable or rational at all? Unless you actually do have a Time Machine and have physically gone back as far as you had to to actually see the process of new life taking place, then jumped ahead in 2 million year increments to see the process work. Without that happening, you are hoping that what is absolutely unprovable is true, but you can live another hundred years and you will be no closer to knowing what actually happened before any life existed on Earth in the primordial past and how it applies to life as we know it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Non-living chemical systems. What else? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Then you readilly admit that life as we know it came from non living chemical reactions. So from non living matter came life? How can you possibly believe this and have a hard time believing in a Supernatural Being called Yahweh, Master of Time and Space? He's easier to believe in than we came from rocks. I mean, even you would have to admit that rocks came from non-living chemical systems too, right? So why couldn't we have come from rocks? Note to Admin, my siggy about rocks and evo doesn't sound so radical now does it. Even chemist agrees its possible. How can a true statement be offensive?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Yes I do and I base my belief on the properties of matter as observed in chemistry and physics. And look at it logically at one time there was no life, later on there was, life had to come from non-life. Is it really easier to believe that some eternal all-powerful being decided to create life one day than it is to believe that life is a chemical and physical effect which can arise due to physical laws? And yes non-living rocks would seem to have come from non-living precursors - does that bother you? The simple matter of fact would appear to be that I have a reasonable understanding of how chemistry works and what chemistry can do while you do not. Thus you put in place a mysterious ( and unnecessary ) being to serve as a comforter for your ignorance of the core knowledge here. This is not uncommon with humans, they have may strange and irrational beliefs, but most try at least to remedy the situation by a process we call learning.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8828_33_32__35_36_37_39_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It proves that there are enough bible believing christians who are also working geologists and Earth Scientists to have an association of like minded members. Are you going to insist that among all of these christian geologists, that not one of them are YECs who work in the field of oil exploration? With that said, I have at least proven that there are enough christian geologists to justify having a professional association. Neither you nor the obvious child have even tried to show that no christian geologists work in the field of oil exploration. Again you read into my statement in order to attribute something to me which I never said. Show where I have equated YEC with christianity as a whole, in context, if you can.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>A simple analogy that comes to mind regarding YEC and Christianity is the distinction between squares and rectangles. Rectangles are polygons with four sides with all internal angles equal to 90 degrees. Squares are rectangles with the further criterion that all sides are of equal length. Accordingly, all squares are rectangles, but all rectangles are not squares. Similarly, all YEC's are Christians, but all Christians are not YEC's. Archangel may have never said, explicitly, that YEC is equivalent to Christianity, but he has been VERY SLOPPY and essentially uses the terms interchangeably. I suspect he does this intentionally to created a straw-man argument. Would ANYONE argue that ALL Christian geologists are hindered because of their religious beliefs? The proposition is absurd! MANY highly functional and successful scientists are Christians. Would a YEC geologist be hindered? Yes! This is the point that several posters have been trying to make. I have not read ANY posts suggesting that Christians, in general, could not be effective geologists. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>This statement proves that you agree that the obvious childs premise of this thread is both dishonest and blatantly inaccurate, as well as an unproven assumption. Secondly, I have neither been sloppy nor have I attempted to create a straw-man argument in any way. I have used a hypothetical and my personal beliefs in order to make as clear as possible my position on this issue. All of which you seem unwilling to, or incapable of grasping. I believe that YEC Geologists are not disadvantaged at all in doing their jobs in oil exploration based on their YEC beliefs. I can't be anymore clear than that, and still await your sides evidence that no Oil exploration company has ever hired a YEC Christian. The fact is that it is an impossible question to answer since companies can't even inquire as to ones religion during the hiring process in this country. But the obvious child has now run away since he can't back up any of his claims with actual evidence at all. Why Tester, don't you point out his straw-man which this thread is based upon? Now, I need to run to Salem to pick up my macbook from the Apple Store. See you on the flip side. :)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Because I think you misinterpreted his point. See below : Archangel : I can see why you're protesting the thread opener. I wish I had addressed this first. I interpreted Obvious Child's opener to argue that oil companies don't specifically attempt to hire YEC geologists -- not that they never hire geologists who happen to be YEC. That is, major oil companies seek oil using plate tectonics, stratigraphy and faunal succession, all of which are incompatible with YEC. That does not mean that an individual Young-Earth Creationist would be unable to perform a specific duty within that company. Certainly no oil company would inquire about a candidate's religious beliefs. A Young-Earth Creationish would, however, be at a disadvantage in terms of understanding the big picture, and the principles of Young-Earth Creationism are certainly not useful for finding oil ( and therefore not desirable to oil companies ). Perhaps Obvious Child will clarify? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I'm typing this from the Apple store on my newly refurbished macbook in order to give the new keyboard a test run. In response to your defense of the obvious child, you give him too much credit for actually thinking through his reasons for posting this thread. And the chances are good that he wont clarify his OP because he knows his original intent was based on a straw-man argument which can't be proven. But I have proven that since an association of christian geologists exists that there are many geologists who are committed christians. And your opinion that YEC Geologists would be at some disadvantage is also just that ; your opinion. Nobody has posted one iota of evidence verifying that claim at all. And in spite of your attempt to clarify what child intended to say, his opening post is clear and direct in claiming that " according to the Last I checked, no credible fossil fuel firm hired YEC geologists. That means he actually checked. Why wont he post that evidence for us all to see? It's because he lied and never checked anything at all and the premise of this thread is based on his own anti-YEC / christian bigotry.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Congrats! Apparently we have something in common Well, I'm sincere in how I interpreted what he wrote, and I honestly believe that is what he meant. Again, I don't think ANYONE has intended to claim otherwise. I think you erroneously interpreted the original post. I'm baffled you're claiming victory for " proving " that some, perhaps many, geologists are Christians. It is simply a matter of fact that was never under debate. Unless someone speaks up to explicitly affirm support of the idiotic counter position ( i. e, that there are no Christian or even YEC geologists ), you're clearly fighting a man of straw. Yes, they have. Seriously. Are you serious?

You characterized the thread as mainly a lover's feud between Arch and OC and that's why you reported it. Given that OC started the thread for that reason, that makes calling it a " troll thread " a fair description. Symbiote said something to the effect of what is the point of this thread? If you want to continue your dishonesty and deny that, then that's your problem. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That is correct - a majority of the posts there were spam between Archie and OC - the Admin removed those posts. It was not the whole thread, nor the thread itself - just a number of subsequent posts IN the thread. I'm sorry it seems you don't like it when your own rules are applied to yourself - that's just tough, isn't it? It may or may not be a fair description. That is not what is being talked about here. What is being talked about here is YOUR false claim that that is the description I gave of it in my post, when I gave no such description. I did not deny nor accept that Symbiote posted that. I said I could not recall if Symbiote had posted, but said he very well could have. Please do not misrepresent my post by claiming that I denied it when I did no such thing. Especially since you have been complaining about O _ C misrepresenting you and Archie in posts. It isn't that fun when you get a taste of your own poison, is it?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I interpret your comments to mean that you referred to the thread as a troll thread. I showed why. It's tough for you to be consistent with yourself. Your comments describing the thread can be characterized as calling it a " troll thread. " I stand by that. Can you show me where I verbatim said GiantOreo used the words troll thread to describe your thread? Please do not misrepresent my post by claiming that I said that you denied what Symbiote said. Repeating what I've said to OC and pretending that I haven't passed my own tests won't make it so. My characterization of your comments was accurate, OC's are not. I pass my test, he does not. It's not poison to me since my comments were accurate. It's plenty fun. Give me more. :) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And I showed why it is not rational to interpret them to mean that, given that no such word was used, nor was the entire thread itself described as anything - merely a number of posts in it ( which have since been deleted ). As I never once used the word troll, nor did I characterize the entire thread as anything, no, they CANNOT be characterized by that. You just posted the quote in your above post. Here is, word for word what you said : In what reality is that NOT saying that I denied what Symbiote said? You stated that he said something and then said it was my problem if I wanted to CONTINUE to DENY that. Quit squirming. It's unbecoming. So you don't care about your hypocrisy? Figures.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I showed why it is rational to interpret it to mean that. You described the thread as being " filled with spam " relating to an " ongoing feud " between the thread starter and the person whose comments were the target of the opening post. That's a troll thread. The fact that you did not use the actual word " troll " is irrelevant. Terms can have a synonymous meaning without being the exact same word. The only way you can prove that I misrepresented your thread is if you can show that I said Giant Oreo verbatim called it a " troll thread. " Can you show this? Again, notice the word " if. " I said " if " you want to do that. If means that you may decide to do something or not. Given that you may decide to continue to be dishonest or not is a true statement, the comment I made is true. You can continue to be dishonest or not - true statement. You aren't capable of making a persuasive enough lie to make me squirm. Don't flatter yourself.

I would like to see that experiment. It would certainly win the nobel prize. So your contention is that dna is not media for information just a lucky mess of chemicals?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Unless there's something very odd about you, you started as a sequence of DNA! You do know basic biology, right? Reproduction? DNA in an egg, cell division, all that stuff? As for whether DNA is a lucky mess or not, that's completely irrelevant to this discussion. It's still just a chemical, which you certainly can't deny, and the development of an organism is based on a series of chemical reactions, centered about that chemical. Change the chemical and you change what reaction you're going to get. Different chemical, different chemical reactions. The entire concept of information is moot, regardless of how you define it. It simply doesn't enter in to the question of why different DNA gives you different organsims. It's all chemistry. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It is hard enough for me to take this seriously as it is. I will refrain from my facetious comments if you will refrain from asking me if have found out the stork was a myth. Fair enough? It is a chemical that has embedded in it the information of life. You make it sound like drain cleaner or something. I agree DNA is a chemical but that the development of an organism is a chemical reaction I do not. Cell division is a bit more complicated than making mustard gas. The information system of dna is amazingly complex. We are made of chemicals but to think life is just random and undirected chemical reactions I find absurd. Why does DNA have a code if information is irrelevant-what is it's purpose? Science has no real idea what life is, to say it is just chance chemical reactions is based on worldview not evidence. If it was we could create life. if you are right we are all just a colossal chemical accident. Then you would be one accident describing the accident that created it. How could you trust your own thoughts? What purpose would life have? It saddens me to think people really feel that way about themselves. What joy could life have, what hope?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Fair enough. I'm sorry, but it really sounds like you are the one basing an opinion on a worldview and not fact. The idea that life, at it's core, is chemistry makes you sad, so you refuse to accept it. If this isn't the case, if your opinion isn't based on emotion, there's a simple way for you to demonstrate it. All you have to do is answer this question. If the development of an organism isn't based on chemistry, then what is it based on? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I'm sorry but I thought you were the smart one here. What do you think I am saying it is based on? Information. The chemistry is the media. And you say I am dense. What is the topic of this post?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well if we both think it than it must be true! Actually, I don't believe I have called you dense yet, but I'm becoming more willing to. Information can't actually do anything. It can't control a process. And chemistry is not a media, it's a collection of rules for how molecules interact. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're trying to hide behind semantics here. So, I'm going to ask again, and please don't be terse or sarcastic. Feel free to use lots and lots of words. If it helps for you to think that I'm not the smart one here than go ahead. Now, here's the question. If the development of an organism is not governed by the rules of chemistry, than what is it governed by? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>At least you have a sense of humor. A rare quality here indeed. Chemicals are media in this case as the biotic code is written into them is it not? Information cannot by itself do anything I agree. However no purposeful action is possible without it. Do you agree? I did not mean to imply I believe that I am smarter than you what I meant was I thought you were the brightest of the people I have discussed this with here. I still do. I was a bit surprised you missed my point entirely but it was probably my poor communication skills that caused the problem. Although you disagree with me you are not dishonest with semantics like so many others. I apologize for the remark. What I believe is God imparted the genetic code, which is still only partially understood, to man and to all the animals at the time of their creation. It does use chemistry to transfer the information to build cells and physical structures. Exactly how God does this I do not know but anyone who claims to truly understand how life came about with certainty I believe is delusional. Even Dr. Crick said it was a near miracle. I believe it was a complete miracle.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3287_96_61__121_147_151_161_165_168_204_205_206_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>peddler's argument is that information that living things consists of, such as dna sequences and neuro-electrical impulses, require the input of an intelligent being in order for it to exist. his definition of information is " something that requires a mind to create or recieve it ". the sequence of base pairs that make up a dna strand existed long before they were discovered. in fact, there is no information that we know today that didnt exist before it was known. peddler also argues that the information about what is at the bottom of the sea or in outerspace or in habib's deli hotdogs does not exist, because it is universally unknown. would you agree? this argument is no less than that about schrodinger's ( sp ) cat. the cat and the poison doesnt exist unless there is someone to observe it. would you agree? is there a difference between " we have no information about x " and " there exists no information about x "?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I don't recall saying neuro-electrical impulses were information.

Electrons are material things. Einstein derived the Equation E = M* C* C. It is well known as part of the relativity theory. This theory states that all matter is energy and all energy is matter. accelerator ( particle accelerator ) - A machine that accelerates charged sub-atomic particles ( electrons, protons, deuterons, etc. ) to high speed and energy. These highspeed particles are often bombarded upon a suitable target and uncharged high-energy radiation is subsequently produced ( neutrons or x-rays ). <br><b>S1:5-  </b>matter and energy are convertable, but matter is not energy. the theory of relativity requires matter to be destroyed in order for energy to be released. if the matter is destroyed, then it doesnt exist anymore this could easily turn into another definition joust of what is non-material. so i wont labor this but end it before it starts lets see if i can go over your assertions again information is non-material <-- agreed for the discussion's sake a mind is non-material <-- inserted by me only a mind can create information <-- assertion you failed to backup dna contains information <-- based on your application of the definition dna is matter <-- inserted by fishpower ( i think ) the dna sequence is a code <-- your interpretation dna sequences are not processed by a mind <-- inserted by me how then, can you demonstrate that the dna sequence is information under your preferred defintion, if you fail to demonstrate how it is created, communicated, or processed by a mind? what mind creates, communicates and processes the " information " in dna?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Lets just agree electricity is not information - fair enough? I agree that a mind is non material. That only a mind can create information is a self evident truth. Give me an example of how information can be created without intelligence? DNA is a code. Codes cannot create themselves and it has a purpose. The Sender and receiver understand the code. Therfore it is information. DNA is matter-the information embedded in the code is non-material. We don't know how DNA sequences are processed. We know they are processed which proves the sender and receiver are intelligent. Bees exchange information but they do not have a mind in the human sense. That is a straw man. Do you know how information is created in your own mind? Do you know how a bee thinks? If you read a book and have no idea who the author is the book itself is still empirical evidence that there was one.

Nirenberg have already won the Nobel prize ( in 1968 ) for working out how the cells of humans ( and all other organisms ) " read " the " biotic code ". There is no such scientific law : you are making it up. No it doesn't. A scientific theory never becomes a scientific law. Scientific laws grow up into scientific theories. Scientific theories are as good as it gets. That is correct. The theory of gravity is a weak one : it has little going for it beyond a few laws and formulas. Actually that is gibberish. Humans are capable of of creating " the biotic code ".

Since we still havent identified the purpose of all the code in the first place. If it fits the description it is. There are no laws of nature-laws of science-facinating. So now laws do exist-make up your mind. I agree everything you said is gibberish. There are no laws-there are laws-that qulaifies as gibberish. Copying and creating are not the same thing. To say we can genetically engineer DNA and produce life is not just gibberish it is a lie.

Since a mind did not create the biotic code, it is not information.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So coding for proteins is not a purpose? It is difficult to argue with your logic. Did you observe my mind deciding how to answer that absurd comment? How many minds have you observed? Please give details as this is one of the more facinating claims I have ever heard. Or are you saying that minds do not exist because you have never observed one? Are you serious or are you just jerking my chain? That is a non-sequitur. It is absurd.

There's no reason we should believe it does though.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>What you call it does not change what it is. As Shakespere said about the rose. I have no reason to believe you can reason. How did matter create itself? You are beginning your argument with the belief that there is no being more intelligent than yourself. No matter what the evidence says you will believe anything no matter how ludicrous than to consider you are not the highest form of life in the universe. That is an incredible assumption but you are so blinded by your religious beliefs you don't even know it. To believe you are the highest form of life is a very foolish thought. It begs the question. How would you know? If you cannot grasp that information cannot create itself then you believe these words may have appeared by magic. If you believe these words could not have possibly appeared without the input of an intelligent being but a code a billion times more condensed than the highest technology of man created itself you are delusional. I don't what else to tell you. This subject is beyond your ability to grasp. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Same goes for you, chump. There may well be more intelligent life in the universe. You certainly haven't provided any evidence of it, quite the opposite. Information cannot create itself. That is how we know DNA is not information. It's called evolution.

Since you insist on defining words in extremely odd ways, I have no idea what you'd term an undesigned, complex, self-replicating system. Read your own links. Even the creationist websites you cite don't support your exceptionally ignorant claims. At least it is clear now where you have stolen your ideas about information.

Please go on.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10491_6_3__9_12_14_15_26_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>This is an idea I read somewhere and thought it was worth noting. Just because God knows exactly what we will do, does that make us any less free or does it mean we are forced against our will? It may be taken that God foreknows what our free acts are ; having knowledge of an act does not mean the act was forced or that the act was not freely done. For example, I can think of the past and know exactly what a person chose to do, and I can know with certainty that that is what the person did. But having knowledge of the act did not make the act any less free, and it doesn't mean that my knowledge of it directly caused or compulsed the person to choose it. Maybe God's knowledge of the future can be similar to our knowledge of the past ; knowing with certainty about a choice or action, without having forced it to happen.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That implies choice which if there is no free will there is no choice If the act is known and not a guess then again there is no choice it just is. That isn't foreknowledge and wouldn't make a difference on whether your future acts are already set. God doesn't need to be the cause, in theory God is not restricted to linear time as we are. God would then be capable of popping into any point in linear time and know the cause and effect of any action without influencing it. The issue with free will and God within religion is that God influences man's choices and by doing so robs us of our free will. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>A lot of it hinges around how you define free will, and it is this precise area where the controversy arises and is the reason why it has been debated for so long. Here you say we have free choice or free will but it is limited. From a theistic perspective, people could view it similarily as you have ; that free will or free choice is limited by God's " popping into any point in linear time " as you say. Personally, I am not fully convinced of one particular view of determinism or how to define freewill ( though I find myself leaning towards one view or another at different times ), but it can be fun to talk about.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The future would have to be set for him to pop into. Religion attempts to constrain free will to a choice between good and evil. That some men choose evil supports their idea of free will. The problem is the final choice is not proof of free will. What makes free will free is that it is made without influence. By offering eternal paradise in Heaven or eternal torments in hell God is influencing what man will choose. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If that is your definition of freewill, and that is what we are going by, then I agree with you. If you or your will needs to be free from all influence in order for it to be a free will, then it is quite obvious that we don't have that free will.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Its not my definition in that I pulled it out of thin air or picked what I liked. Its the drfinition one finds in an English Dictionary. I think it fair to consider that a reasonable place to start with respect to meaning. If you have different understanding then please let me know what it is and why it should be considered over the dictionary entry. The word free is kind of hard to get around. There is not a lot of wiggle room there. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The question is : In what regards is our will free? Free from what? You answered it one way by saying it is free from all influences ( which is just about everything ). Here is a link that goes through different other answers Free will - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This link does not have an exhaustive list of the different views, but it is enough to make my head spin. Here's another link with another view and definition. It's quite interesting, I haven't read all of it but it so far sounds like a viable possibility. http://www.optimal.org/peter/freewill.htm</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10491_22_20__24_27_29_31_46_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Databed, if any future decision can be foreknown, then free will cannot exist. Free will means that at the instant of the decision, any of all options can be taken. If the decision is foreknown, then none of the options can be taken except the one that is foreknown to be taken. It doesn't matter if god is directing or not, if he knows the option that will be chosen before it is chosen, then there is no choice among the remaining options, and therefore there is no free will.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I have to disagree. My example of a movie was supposed to emphasize that an observer can know the end while watching the middle but have no control over what is going on. This is because he does not exist in the same continuum as the movie itself. Would it satisfy some of you if I said that in this example, any attempt to step into the movie, or continuum, would result in changing the outcome of said continuum and remove any knowledge that an observer has of the future? Because this must also be true in my example. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Nobody is saying god is the director or controller, we are all agreeing for the sake of the discussion that he's just the observer. Even in this case free will is taken away from the ones being observed. If at some point in the movie the actor must make a decision, that decision is not one of free choice, but only the option that keeps the movie on the predetermined path. If you can fast forward or rewind the movie at any given point, and the actions at that point are already foreknown, then it is a predetermined action, not one of spontaneous free will at that point in the timeline.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But why not? Let's say that I do have freewill. I live my life making free choices free from influence of an observer outside of my continuum. You're basically saying that just because someone has the ability to move in time to any point within my timeline and simply view it, even if they have absolutely no ability to interfere, that my life was predetermined and the entity that determined the unfolding of my timeline cannot be me. Clear a couple of things up for me. In this scenario, if I wasn't determining my own path, then what was? Why can't something else, outside of my continuum, know what my actions are? I think you are not understanding what atemporality is in this case. If something knows what all of my actions are, you can't say that he knows them before they take place because there is no before, no after, no during in his continuum. He is outside of my timeline. He is atemporal to my continuum. My example of a movie was to demonstrate this. Just because someone can watch the movie having already seen it and knows what the ending is going to be, does not necessitate that the movie was predetermined within the timeline and at the time in which it was created. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Look at it from the perspective of options. For free will to exist, the chooser must have the liberty to choose any of the known options available. If your decisions are known, then the option you will choose is predetermined. Let's say you have to choose between options a, b and c. It is foreknown that you will choose option a. In such a case it is impossible for the chooser to pick option b or c. Those options, even though known by the chooser, are not possible to be chosen at all. It is equivalent to having no choice but to pick the option that was predetermined and foreknown. There was really no other choice at all to begin with<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I understand what you are saying, but you are again not grasping what I am saying as evident by the word " foreknown " as used above. The decisions are not foreknown, they are not known after they happen, they are not known at the time. They are simply known by an atemporal being. There should be no argument here, this is the way things must follow under the scenario I have presented. It is a way for omniscience to exist and free will to exist side by side ( note I avoided the word simultaneously and omnipotent ). Please note I am not condoning this view. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I define omniscience differently. Omniscience is the knowledge of all things that are. Things that are not simply are not. If you know all things that are, and do not know things which are not, you have omniscience. A future decision, action or event is something that is not, and therefore knowledge of something that is not is not a requirement for one to have omniscience</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10491_84_82__87_88_89_90_91_94_95_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Those ' easy ' translation do not state that gods ability is limited because he is incapable of anything. They are a reassurance of a promise. Please dont keep banging on with the same flawed argument if you dont want to hear the same explanation. Your explanation is only correct in YOUR own mind. All powerful and etenal are words only.. you cannot understand or comprehend their meaning. Your problem is that you cannot comprehend this. God cannot cease to exist in the same way that infinite cannot cease to exist.. if you think that this is a limitation on infinite then you do not understand or comprehend infinite. Which is exactly what I am saying. Thank you for proving my point for me<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Okay. Like I said, You're right, but only in your own mind. You asked me to show you where the Bible limited God, and I showed you that it clearly stated that God can't lie, can't look upon evil ( you still haven't responded to that one ), can't change, and can't cease to exist. Telling someone they can't understand something isn't at all convincing. I'm sure you can't understand it, but that's no reason to assert things about me, and even more so it's not an argument that helps you. All you are doing is saying " If you disagree, you just don't understand. " You've provided nothing to back up your position, and have resorted to ignoring and twisting any scriptures that prove you wrong so that you don't have to man up to your being wrong. And yes, ' infinity ' is limited in the sense that it can not end. It is a stipulation, and it exists for everything, which can easily be stated as this : It can't be something that it is not. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You are supplying the scriptures that do not back up your assertions... dont blame me for that. As I stated something that is infinite cannot be seen as ' limited ' because it cannot cease to exist ( and that in itself is making an assumption that cannot be backed up in any practical way ) It is your logic and the limitations of language that is limiting your ability to understand what is obvious. If you think that a covenant not to lie means the being that makes it is limited then I cant help you. If I promise not to lie to a child does that make me any less powerful? As for god cant look upon evil... this illustrates the limitation of language... does an omnipotent being have eyes? Could lucifer give him a poke in his eye and blind him or does he have an infinite amount of eyeballs? You provide the very questions in a form that proves my point To be honest your obtuseness is quite annoying, especially as you are projecting it at<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Can't back up that an eternal being can't cease to exist? That's the definition of the word! If it was possible for him to cease to exist, he wouldn't be eternal. And since an inability to do something is a limitation, my point is proven. Again, it's not the oath, it's that the verse says that it was impossible for him to break that oath ( because he can't lie ). You can't escape the word ' impossible ' here. You are trying to say that God just chooses not to, but that doesn't agree with the scripture. If it is possible for God to lie, the bible is lying. Either way, you asked for biblical support, and your position goes against what the bible says. If you still want to continue to believe that ' impossible ' doesn't really mean ' impossible, ' then go ahead, but your not convincing anyone else. The seeing evil argument really wasn't about the literal-ness of his ' eyes, ' but regardless I will take that one back since the bible contradicts itself on this issue : Proverbs 15 :3 <br><b>S1:3-  </b>What you dont understand is that if an infinite being cannot cease to exist it does not mean this is a limitation of the beings capabilities. It means that non existence is not applicable to it. When you understand that then you may start to understand your limitation in comprehension. Can god change his socks? Once again you are using an imperfect medium to try to make an point that is not appllicable. It is impossible for god to lie because he agreed not to, not because he cannot. This does not mean the bible is lying.. it means he means to keep his word. Sheesh.. once again you highlight the limitation of words.. the bible mentions gods eyes to try to make a point to people that have limited comprehension. None of the texts were meant to exactly quantify any aspect of god... but you supplied the sentences and complain when I take them literally in one way when you choose to take them literally in another Impossible means impossible because god chooses to do it. If want to believe that impossible means an omnipotent being cannot do something... hence not being omnipotent because he has agreed to do it the go ahead.. but you are not convincing anyone except yourself. Maybe you really think the bible told us god has eyeballs lol<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Shifting the goalposts. It is still a limitation on God. And if God created everything and sent himself to earth in human form, then yeah, he can change his socks, his shoes, his pants, and his underwear. ( He doesn't wear a shirt because as we all know, gods are ripped and like to show off their pecs ). Seems you still want to believe ' impossible ' means ' possible '. I think you need to check your own ' understanding ' of language. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>To be infinite is NOT a limitation because ' not existing ' does not apply to it and therefore cannot be seen as a limitation. If you think it does then I think you need to check your own understanding of language. A promise from a diety is as near as a certainty as to be written as impossible to be broken in a text written by man. If you think that it does not then you demonstrate again your limitations in understanding the limitations of the written word and so must believe god has eyes :). Why should god have to become a man to change his socks.. maybe he has celestial socks... will he still need to change them?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Okay, let me get this straight. If I think _______, then I must be an idiot. That sounds about right for a gansao argument, and because of that ( and the fact that you admitted you weren't taking the word ' impossible ' as completely impossible, which is what the word means ), I'm done here. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>OK Ill except the literal term impossible if you admit you think god has In other words.. yes you are an idiot for trying to make me accept a literal meaning of a word that suits you and implies an omnipotent being has limited abilities... as well as eyes.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-15_71_69__72_74_77_82_83_87_89_92_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Isnt heat a frequency of radiation? Wouldnt the amplitude of heat in a mollecule be mediated by the ammount of gluons, weak guage bosons and photons it contained? I do understand that heat is supposed to be the kinetic energy of the individual mollecules due to there increase in velocity, and conserved in the mollecular body due to the collision of the mollecules up to the point of vaporization. But before that, some energy is lost due to radiation of these particles I mentioned earlier. But when a body of matter absorbs these particles and they become bound to the mollecules, does the velocity of the mollecule change? Or is the kinetic energy changed due to the increase in mass of the mollecule from the extra radiation particles?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Certain wavelengths of light, usually in the infrared and into the microwave can excite molecules into higher vibrational, roatational, or translational energy states. So frequencies of radiation can cause things to heat up, surely. Simple answer : NO. Gluons don't have much to do with heat as we experience it. Well, don't forget about vibrations and rotations, but heat is a manifestation of this kinetic energy, yes. Don't know what you are talking about with the " point of vaporization. " No, simple molecular collisions do not result in radiation of subatomic particles. Well, except when the collisions are really intense, as in an atomic bomb. Nope, this is nonsense. Sorry. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Gluons dont have much to do with heat? How bout the w and z bosons, and the photon? when a substance vaporizes, the individual mollecules draw heat away to cool the substance. This happens when the body of matter cannot radiate as much energy as it recieves, and the matter reaches an energy level sufficent to break the electromagnetic bond of the particles. In water, this would be the hydrogen bond. And mollecular collisions isnt what I'm talking about for radiation of subatomic particles. The mollecules may exchange these particles until the particles reach the surface of the body at wich time the wave / particle such as a photon leaves the body of matter leaving it with a lower kinetic energy. Please tell me why my last statement is nonsense?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well, the W znd Z bosons cause radioactive decay, so sure, they can contribute to heat. The photon, of course, is responsible for all kinds of things. It's those microwave photons that are heating your bag of popcorn. But gluons, IIRC, are the exchange particles responsible for the strong force. They just hold nuclei together. I don't see them contributing to heat in everyday circumstances. Ok, what does that have to do with what you were talking about? I think you were talking about atoms absorbing gluons or something, and that's just not how gluons work. I may be wrong, but gluons are not exchanged between nuclei, except in nuclear reactions, I suppose. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>This has to do with the exchange of the thermal energy of matter, or heat as it is defined. And gluons werent the only bosons I was talking about. I was just trying to point out that if a mollecule / atom gained a bosonic particle, then the kinetic energy of the mollecule / atom would increase due to the increase in mass. An example would be if a photon excites an electron, it stays with the electron in the excited state and therefore increases the electrons kinetic energy. When the electron discharges a photon, the electron drops to a lower quantum state, hence a lower kinetic energy. This increase / decrease in kinetic energy of the electron in an atom would increase / decrease the kinetic energy of the mollecule / atom.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I see. Photons do all this, but I don't know what gluons have to do with thermal energy, except that when the strong force is overcome, you have nuclear fission. That surely generates heat. Again, we have confused usage of the terms " temperature " and " energy. " The substance can be of one temperature, but the particles that make up that substance cannot all be in the same energy state. In a bose / einstein condensate they are in the same energy state. But normal matter, since it consists of fermions, cannot do this. http://www.pa.msu.edu/courses/1997sp...ic/bosons.html But here we are talking about apples and oranges. In one we are talking about thermodynamic microstates ( from statistical thermodynamics ) and calling them " energy states " and the other is talking about quantum mechanical states. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Temprature Is energy. Its just a specific form of energy. Thermal energy to be exact. And werent you just talking about thermal energy? And as for gluons, I dont know too much about them except that they mediate the strong nuclear force, and are responsible for holding nucleons together, as well as binding quarks together to form the nucleons. Do gluons have an energy value? I know that they are a point particle and have no volume, but they must have mass to have energy. And about your point of a substance being at a certain temp but the particles not being in the same energy state, does this have something to do with the fact that a crystal emits a certain frequency when it is heated or compressed? Mayabe the oscillation of the mollecules allign and this causes the frequency that we can detect. In a Bose / Einstein condensate are all of the particles bosons?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No, it is a measure of the average kinetic energy within a given frame. Sure, heat is just another way to say thermal energy. Sure. Ok. Of course. Well, in QED ( quantum electrodynamics ), mathematically particles are treated as dimensionless points, but they may not actually physically be that. But you don't have to have mass to have energy. The photon is the prime example of this. A photon has no mass, but can have a wide range of energies, from picometer-long gamma rays to kilometer-long radio waves. Not sure what you are talking about? The piezoelectric effect? Um, yeah. This page is cool : http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/bec/index.html Keep clicking Next. And Helium atoms are bosons. I'm not sure if the way they become a superfluid at a certain temperature has anything to do with Bose-Einstein. http://www.fluidmech.net/msc/super/super-f.htm Well, apparently they are : http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Superfluid That's interesting, I didn't know you could have Cooper pairs of atoms. { shrug } That's why I come on these boards.... <br><b>S1:5-  </b>How bout we all combine two different peoples theories into one!

Each of us is the result of a thought of God. Each of us is willed, each of us is loved, each of us is necessary.    -- Benedict XVI I have to admit that I really don't know the incidence of believers of evolution amongst catholics, but catholics are not required to believe in evolution, and many disagree with the pope    s position that a belief in evolution is even acceptable. If the bible is the infallible word of god and it says right out of the gate :    And God made man in his image, in the image of God he made him : male and female   , then that    s pretty tough to get around, no matter what the pope says. Yikes, tebor. I didn't see that you had already posted that quote.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That just goes to show how ignorent even Catholics are. Let us look the puns from the original hebrew. When it talks about how god made man, it used the term ' formed '.. the same word that would used as a potter would form a pot. THe word " Adam " means man kind. It is similar to ' Adamah " which means red clay, and a related word is ' edom ', which means flesh and blood. So, if you look at the original hebrew, it basically says ' God formed mankind out of flesh and blood, as a potter forms a clay vessel '. Although evolution does not consider any supernatural influences, the ' forming of mankind out out oif flesh and blood ' is certainly consistant with evolution. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No, it is not. Single celled organisms do not have flesh or blood.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But apes do. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And you believe that god created apes?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Myself, no. I don't believe there is any deity what so ever. I, however, was commenting on the meaninging of Genesis if you read it in Hebrew, vs the rather inaccurate translation into English. It is obvious Genesis was only an allegory, not literal. Since it is only an allegory, it was commenting on spiritual truths, not historical or scientific facts. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>What you said was : The premise that god made apes ( or some other multi-celled organism ) is no more consistent with evolution than if he had just made man.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>That is your religious belief. However, many good christians disagree with you. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I don    t care how many good christians disagree with me. If you don    t believe in any deity, then using the support of people that you think are deluded to support your position is meaningless. Doesn    t evolution maintain that multi-celled organisms came from single-celled ones? If so, then any supposition that isn    t consistent with that transition is inconsistent with evolution.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Yes, and evolution has examples of intermediatary organism for that. Now, you claim that ' support using people that I think are delueded ' is meaningless. Where did I say they are deluded? You seem to be projecting. It seems you want to disregard anything that does not meet your opnion. How is that debate? You just have a knee jerk reaction, and ignore any kind of evidence that is presented that does not meet with your preconceptions. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Therefore you are conceding that    the ' forming of mankind out out oif flesh and blood ' is certainly consistant with evolution    is wrong. Just follow the train of logic. Intermediate between single-cell and multi-cell? What are your examples? You have already conceded the debate. Therefore, you yourself can    t think much of the    evidence   . I said that I don    t care how many good christians disagree with me. Why should I?

If their will was to be based on any type of education, the U.S. Constitution would have been written differently. The argument can't really be made that times have changed - that the founders came from a time when there wasn't much higher education. The founders could all read and write, yet a large percentage of the U.S. population could not at that time.

What has been said about Jefferson ( or any other person of that time ) that has been distorted, as you claim? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The constitution makes no reference to education, concerning terms of senators or represenatives, or any of the workings of government. The senate is a level above the house, hence the longer terms. Concerning your " shifting terms of the rabble " reference, the concern was about " mob rule " - a majority taking advantage of a minority. A thing called greed. Greed and education, are not related. Since you missed what I said concerning the view of the founding fathers regarding education, I'll repeat what I said ; The founding fathers views on education would correspond with their worldviews.

The founding fathers ' views on the uneducated correspond exactly with their written views on the uneducated. Except that the term ' separation of church and state ' became part of the body of law long before 1947 : Chief Justice Morrison Waite, ( in Reynolds vs. U.S., 1878 ) cited Jefferson's letter of 1802 and the phrase ' separation between church and state ". He further stated in his written opinion " Coming as this does,... from an acknowledged leader of the advocates of the measure, it may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the amendment thus secured.

It's sticking your fingers in your ears and going " la-la-la, I can't hear you! " Faith isn't belief despite evidence, it's belief despite lack of evidence. It's not the absence of doubt, it's perserverance in the face of doubt. Failure to admit that you could be wrong doesn't show your faith in God, in shows your faith in your own infalibility. It's procaiming that not only can you not be wrong, but that you understand God perfectly ; both ludicrous claims. If your faith is really strong, then it will stand up to self-examination. Everyone doubts, everyone questions. Sometimes the questions lead to new answers, sometimes they reinforce the old answers. But you have to ask the questions. An unexamined faith isn't faith, it's just pride and stuborness. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>if God tells you something, then it must be true, regardless of evidence. wouldnt the fact that God says something be enough to make it true? lets say, for example, God says that if you paint your door red someone will deposit $10000 in your bank account. now assuming that the actual one and only true and living all-mighty God said so, would that alone make it true? you may not even have a bank account, but once you paint your door red, you expect to be the owner of a bank account with a $10,000 balance in it, not so? if there is anything at all in the bible that was actually said by God, then it MUST be true, regardless of evidence for or against. doubting that it is true would not change the truth about it, but acting on anything actually said by God would make absolute sense, because that would be the absolute truth. if someone has no doubt in their mind that a statement made by God is totally and irrefutably true, is that person pigheaded and stubborn?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No. But that's not what we have here, is it? We don't have a statement made by God, we have a statement that you believe was made by God. In fact, you believe that every single statement in the Bible was made by God. And you refuse to examine that assuption, for fear of losing your faith. And so, in the name of your infallible faith, you've closed your mind to everything else. You've closed yourself off from all of creation because you refuse to even consider the possibility that every single word in the Bible didn't come straight from God. Remember, no one is questioning God's truth, they're questioning whether or not something is God's truth. Faith in God is great. Refusal to consider whether or not something did in fact come from God is pigheaded and stubborn. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>ok, so once again, how do we determine what in the bible was said by God, if any? in fact, it may be totally possible that NOTHING in the bible is actually the word of God. we already can safely say, according to you, that not everything in the bible purported as the word of God was actually said by God. so what in the bible is? and how do you determine that? if the bible is not the source for the word of God, what is?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>How do you find the word of God? Read the Bible critically, with an open mind. Read the works of wise and good people. Talk with people and discuss things ; again, with an open mind. Accept that you don't already have all the answers. Be willing to learn and grow. It won't be easy. It takes alot of work, and may cause you to change some long held opinions, which can be scary. But, if you'll forgive me for reading between the lines of some of your posts, I think you already know that some of your beliefs contradict the evidence of the real world. I think a part of you already is questioning whether a literal Bible really makes sense. So take the next step. Re-read the Bible, but this time without the assumption that it's all God's literal word. Ask yourself who wrote what you're reading, and why? What were they trying to say? What does it mean? How does it fit in with the rest of what you've read? Try that, and you may find things that you've never seen before. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>you are saying that by reading the bible only, i will not find all the answers. since the bible is but the work of man, and a collection of personal judgements and best guesses, what makes it more valueable than anything i can come up with? there is no reason to believe these men were hearing from or being inspired by God, since they got so many errors. there is no way to determine which of the authors either genuinely heard from God, or recorded correctly what they heard. there is no way to determine if the people that compiled the modern canon were inspired by God and not politics ( which is likely the case ) since God hadnt actually spoken to any of the authors of the bible back then, why would we assume that he is a God that communicates to humans?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Not all people are the same. Some are evil, some are good. Some are wise, some are foolish. The best guess of a good, wise man is worth more than that of an evil idiot any day, right? Is Pol Pot's take on morality worth as much as Ghandi's? Obviously, no. Likewise, the writers of the Bible display uncommon wisdom, which makes their words worth more than the average Joe you might pull off the street. That's why its valuable. There's wisdom in there that has survived the test of time for millenium. Don't discard it just because it didn't come directly from God. I won't lie to you. It is possible that after reading the Bible with an open mind you could reach that conclusion. On the other hand, after allowing for human fallibility, the word of God may come through more clearly than ever before. You seem to want to know where the journey will end before you start it. I can't tell you that, no one can.

" Nonetheless, people have offered plenty of sound evidence against the idea of a global flood of the nature described in the Bible myth.

Richard.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I wasn't presenting an alien theory. I was saying that if I was, it would be up to me to provide the evidence to back it up. Saying " well, prove that aliens didn't populate the planet " is shifting the burden of evidence. Therefore, if you want to postulate a theory ( " The Noah's Ark story is true. " ), it is up to you to provide the evidence that proves your statement, not others to prove you wrong. If you don't have enough evidence to defend your theory such that you need to take an offensive ( as opposed to defensive ) position, you should re-think the value of your theory. At least, you should not expect others to believe it as you do, since it is based on a chosen faith and not logical evidence. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Correct! but the theory according to the thread title is not really a theory at all rather a question, which I have answered before, so me asking a question is not shifting the burden of evidence mearly inviting more debate. Not my argument!!! now who's shifting. Read my response to lurch.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Incorrect! When a person says you are shifting the burden, they are usually not referring to the title of the debate, but to what you have said. Therefore, it doesn't matter if the thread title is " How does Santa fit all those toys on the sled? ", and you had already replied " Obviously he shrinks them with magic until he is through your chimney. " If you go on to say, " well, where's your scientific evidence that rudolph didn't have a red nose? ", you would still be shifting the burden of evidence. Therefore, as you are the one putting forward a theory ( global flood ), it is up to you to defend that theory. So, what is your evidence of this global flood?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-903_94_85__113_119_121_123_125_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>These are philosophies of science, not actual science itself. People are subjective, even scientists. The latter use a tool of objectivity ( science ) to minimise that subjectivity ( such as recognising the bias of the hypothesis and thus testing the inverse [ the null hypothesis ] ), but they remain subjective. Science can be debased by bad scientists. G.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You say that they are not science, only because you know Nazi science to be ' false '. You were ( probably ) * taguht western capitalist science, only it doesn't have the term attached to it. Most people on this forum believe that it is the normative theory of science, and then all other versions of science are false. For instance ( and this is from my ' many faces of science ' ) Darwin believed women were meek, in line with the beliefs of his century. Male dominated science continued to describe the characteristics of women, in evolutionary terms, but through the male perspective. Now feminist scientists for instance ' discovered ' that the ovum actually snare a sperm, so it's not passive at all. Any previous description of the fertilisation of the egg was ' true ' through a western male dominated perspective. However there's an alternative western feminist theory. * Assuming you're educated in the UK <br><b>S1:2-  </b>montalban, if there is one thing that I detest in people, its them not listening to what I say and assuming I meant what they wanted me to say. If I believed that they were " not science, only because [ I ] know Nazi science to be ' false ' ", I would have said so. If I say that they are philosophies of science and not different types of science, its because THAT IS WHAT I MEAN! You are unable to differential between science and philosophies of science. You can repeat the idea that there are multiple types of science as much as you want, but you are wrong and will remain wrong. " Feminist Science " and " Maxist Science ", " Western Capitalist / English Impiralist Science " " Ignorance-based Misinformed Idiot Creationist Science " are not sciences. They are different ways of applying subjectivity to the objectivity of science. G.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If what you say is true, then I might term evolution as the philosophy of ' Western Capitalist / Imperialist Science " Would that make you happy? I suspect though that you believe that evolution is not a philosophy of science and is ' science ' Anyway, again you miss the point. You can only call Nazi science non-objective, because you believe it is false science. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The theory of evolution through natural selection is neither philosophy of science, nor ' science ' ; its science. You are doing it again. How do you know that I believe " Nazi science " to be false science? G.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes, it's comforting to believe that. But it is a materialist philosophy that has mutually exclusive evidences and other contradictions. However, Feminist philosophies of science :) have shown that evolutionary science is in fact dominated by a male-orientated philosophy of science. What you hold to be ' true ' in an evolutionary sense, is not necessarily true. Thus I showed that Darwin believed that women were the weaker of the two sexes, and evolutionary science for the next 100 + years has come to show this to be true - excepting under the gaze of feminists, who have shown a lot of these assumptions are in fact false. Where is the ' true ' science in all of this? You said it wasn't science, but a philosophy of science. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The science is not the people's opinions ( thats the philosophy ) but in the underlying maths and empirical evidence. You only seem interested in reading people's opinions of science, rather than learning about the science itself. I think you do this as finding people who disagree with each other encourages you to form the often false opinion that the science itself is divided. Exactly : I said it was a philosophy of science, not a false science. Rather than asking for clarification of my position though, you seem hell bent on making assumptions about everything I say that you do not understand.

The Gospels make you out as either misinformed or a liar.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Don't change the subject. The topic was, " dead people don't get up after 3 days of being dead and walk around ". If you think otherwise, you should offer some evidence. By the way, the universe just appearing out of nowhere is your theory, not that of the science community. There is evidence to support the Big Bang Theory. And who cares what the gospels say, they are at best just hearsay. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Read the Gospels. Most of history is hearsay. So go throw your history books in the garbage. What existed before the Big Bang? Let's hear your THEORY.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Already have. They are not even well written. But most of history has corroborating evidence. Your gospels have nothing. They're not even consistent. As for what was there before the big bang, I don't know. We have no data to examine. But that does not mean we should make stuff up. " God " is just a non-answer. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It's the #1 Best Seller in history, preppie, so what would you know? Nuts. < Flush > You're full of folly. I have four ( 4 ) Independent, historical Gospels plus assorted Epistles for corroboratiion. You're the one who has nothing but denials.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yet again, your gospels are not independent. It doesn't matter how many time you say it, you're still being willfully ignorant. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Back that folly up with some facts then. I have four Gospels written at different times by different people in different places and you sit there like a know-it-all and say they're not independent? Back it up.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Here is a little snippet from the Catholic Planet web page. Even they admit that there was copying going on. But you can ignore the evidence if you wish. It's what we expect from you. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Nice try. First, even if your " copying " theory is correct, did they copy the TRUTH or a lie? You are interested in the truth, aren't you? Where's your evidence they copied a lie, or that they copied at all? There's another explanation that even many evangelicals overlook that nullifies your theory of copying : " But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you. " - Jesus, John 14:26 So they had no need to copy - all they needed was divine assistance. Finally, you said the Gospels don't agree with each other ( although all four confirm the death and resurrection of Christ ). Here's a blurb where not even Seal team / government officials agree on how Bin Laden was killed. SEAL book raises questions about bin Laden's death - Washington Times So once again, you've got nothing but your usual conjecture and unsubstantiated theories.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Well we seem to have at least an admittance of the possibilty that there may have been some copying going on. Quite a big step from the insistance that you have " 4 INDEPENDENT GOSPELS ". You now feel the need to defend the claim that they didn't really need to copy because the holy ghosty was guiding them. Note that this is a claim in the bible, which is the very thing that is in question, so cannot justifyably be used as evidence in the debate of whether the bible is " THE TRUTH ". You're slipping into your usual circular argument. The bible must be true because those who wrote it were inspired by the holy ghost as is detailed in the bible which must be true because those who wrote it were inspired by the....... rinse, repeat. And surely, if your argument that the gospel writers didn't need to copy because they were guided by the holy ghost is true, then why are you comparing them to differing accounts of Bin Laden's death? Surely they must be perfectly accurate if divinely inspired. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I never said that, you did. They all agree on the resurrection, his miracles, his crucifixion, etc. You still can't see the forest for the trees. And I also noticed you had zero evidence for your copying claim ( Who copied who, when, where, why.. ). Don't try your hand at being a reporter because you're a full quart low on facts and evidence to support your THEORIES.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>But you did change your tune from, " I have 4 independent gospels blah, blah, blah ", to, " well even if your claim is true, they didn't need to because they were all inspired by the holy ghost ". That in itself is a very big step for you. I just gave you a quote from the Catholic Planet web page. Did you not read it? It explains how Matthew's gospel would have been ' widely circulated ' by the time Mark wrote his gospel, and that Mark probably had a copy of it ( plenty of opportunity for plagiarism there ). And later Luke had both Matthew and Mark as sources ( even more stuff to copy ). And later still John would have had access to all three other gospels ( widely circulated ). And not only that, he would have been writing for the ' whole church ', which would have given him all the incentive he needed to support the divitiy of this Jesus character, whom it is very likely none of them ever met. If you think that is ' zero evidence ' then there is no hope of you ever accepting any evidence against your willfully ignorant belief in your omnievil sky-daddy. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>I didn't change anything. I remain steadfast that the Gospel writers didn't need to copy anyone because of John 14 : 6. I'm not a Catholic. What's more, opportunity doesn't prove anything. You bring that argument up in a court of law and the defense and the Judge will blast you out of the courtroom. It is zero evidence and you're a stiff-necked fool for thinking you have anything other than more hot air and conjecture.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>You think that my evidence would be blasted out of court? Maybe, but your evidence wouldn't even be admitted as a case. You have absolutely nothing. Hearsay at best, just a poorly written story with unbelievable characters and dodgy plot-lines is nearer the mark. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>You're full of horse manure, as usual. Dr. Simon Greenleaf, the Royal Professor of Law at Harvard University, wrote the much circulated and highly regarded legal volume entitled, A Treatise on the Law of Evidence, considered to be the greatest legal volume ever written. Initially, Dr. Greenleaf believed the Resurrection of Jesus Christ was a hoax. So much so that he resolved to expose it as such conclusively. After a thorough examination of the evidence for the resurrection, Dr. Greenleaf concluded that the biblical account was absolutely true. Here are some excerpts from his book " An Examination of the Testimony of the Four Evangelists by the Rules of Evidence Administered in the Courts of Justice " : " it was impossible that the apostles could have persisted in affirming the truths they had narrated, had not Jesus Christ actually risen from the dead,... " - Simon Greenleaf, An Examination of the Testimony of the Four Evangelists by the Rules of Evidence Administered in the Courts of Justice, p. 29 ). Moreover, Greenleaf concluded that the resurrection of Jesus Christ was the best supported event in all of history!

That removes it even further from any underlying genetic pattern. It obviously happened but it did not evolve ( the process ). A tautology is not false because it is a tautology ; in fact that would be a contradiction. My argument is not a tautology, you simply cannot abandon the premises that it's falsification would require. Actually that can happen but it requires the exceedingly rare case that every step in the annihilation of a system is beneficial because it destroys the system. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>How about the blind river dolphin, do you think that is an example of something un-advancing? South Asian river dolphin - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia They use to have sight but evolved into blind animals, would that be an advancement or not?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Yes that is un-advancing ( the loss of a system ), and while this may help their species in the short term it reduces the ability to adapt to future changes. Now when I say yes I mean I think it's possible, it could also have been genetic drift allowed to destroy a currently vestigial eye. @ MrWriteLA the modification of the limb to be better at swimming is not the loss of a limb. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Dolphins used to live on land but returned to the sea via evolution, that would be something you don't agree with, right?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I cannot disagree with a fact. But were they a different species before contact? Are polar bears and brown bears the same species now that we have confirmed a hybrid? Every diploid organism is genetically diverse from each other. If you're saying divergence constitutes a new species how much? Arguments need premises, and I have them. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So you do agree that dolphins once lived on land but returned to the sea through evolution?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>They weren't dolphins when they were on land and no, not through evolution there are advancements over land mammals in dolphins. Obama, health care, life, Americans, accessibility are in the universe. Same problem. You couldn't display your ignorance more clearly. Neither of those were arguments. You aren't qualified to be debating much less lecture on logic.

" A = " an argument dealing with something in the universe " A = ~ A <br><b>S1:5-  </b>What kind of advancements?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>You have contradicted yourself : You have identified statements erroneously as arguments : Since you do not admit or even seem to recognize these failures it is unlikely that it was a mistake and more likely that you are ignorant of the fact they are failures. Thus you lack the basic knowledge of formal logic required to understand or participate in debates effectively. The sonic systems for one. Their intelligence has no doubt taken a unique path since divergence and is superior to most land mammals. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>So you are saying the sonic system and the intelligence of dolphins can not be explained by evolution?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Correct, nor any other system. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>So breeding dogs using selection is plausible, but making big changes like from lower intelligence to higher intelligence or developing a XXXX-hole in the top of your head is not?<br><b> S2:7-  </b>The scale involved is unimportant except to the odds of spontaneous generation. Dog breeding may have produced a great deal of diversity but as of yet no one's tried to construct novel systems with it. That is conceivable for people to do because we can have a final system in mind and select for something that is not naturally beneficial merely because it moves towards the system we are trying to build. I know no example in any animal breeding of this occurring, even our genetic engineering usually just tampers with existing systems to suite our tastes or we just copy useful proteins from other organisms and paste them onto crops and such. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Evolution gives us very reasonable explanations to everything we see around us, just because we haven't seen all of it doesn't mean the rest of what we know is wrong.<br><b> S2:8-  </b>Support that. <br><b>S1:9-  </b>Supporting common sense seems redundant.

If you require a nitpick to keep you from losing correctness in the details I am happy to provide that service.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Nonononono.

You mean despite the fact that probably coming up on a dozen times now I have told you premises represent evidence and you decided that the last time I told you this was a concession.... What do you think a ' logical premise ' is? Show me denying that I said A. I'll be honest I have no way to prove otherwise because proof relies on logic. Of course there is an objective truth here, I can illustrate the contradiction inherent in false logic using the real world ; but if you don't accept that contradiction is unacceptable....<br><b> S2:5-  </b>If a premise is true, it can be used as evidence. How does one determine a premise to be true? You said in the PM : " With evidence. It will take quite a lot of research to get to that premise. That premise is the conclusion of the research.

I also stated the method by which research was connected to a higher premise, an argument concluding that higher premise. I did not show that nature is synonymous to pertaining, and I did not claim that they were. Interesting, but what of denying that I said statement A?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Yes, among other things. Premises are not useful unless proven true, yes? A true premise can be used as evidence towards an argument. A premise is understood to be true if evidence supports it, so in a formally laid out argument, a true premise is just a statement supported by evidence. http://numero6.altervista.org/_alter...urfacepalm.png "...' regarding the nature of ', ' dealing with ', and ' pertaining to ' are all closely synonymous ( as attested to by dictionary.com )...

You're talking about a lower level argument that's all. A statement is understood to be true if a sound or cogent argument supports it, or for all practical purposes both parties agree it's true.

The observations are the facts. The theories explain the facts. Why don't you try to educate yourself about science before you speak. All scientific theories explain, by definition. theory : A set of statements or principles devised to explain a group of facts or phenomena. - American Heritage Science Dictionary and theory : An explanation for sets of phenomena that is developed by observation and experimentation. - Dictionary of Modern Biology I know the concept is pretty difficult for you to grasp, but try. Not really. It was a gene duplication and an alternative long open reading frame of an internally repetitious coding sequence. There does not appear to have been a point mutation. However, this is macro evolution since it created a new species ( Flavobacterium Sp. K 172 ). The actual new gene is located on the pOAD 2 plasmid. It produces a 392 - amino acid-long-residue bacterial enzyme. The original reading of the sequence produced a 472 - residue-long protein sequence. I believe that the original gene still produces this protein sequence. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>But it doesn't. Description is not explanation, even when one is able to describe as a single universal principle. Alright, why do masses exert attractive forces on each other? Confusion in general nomenclature ( as evidenced by the varying and sometimes contradictory definitions presented for scientific terms [ up to and including science and scientific themselves ] ) does not translate to my ignorance simply because I recognize them. Then give me ' the theory ' of gravity. Interesting, so you are saying that this thing lost 240 base pairs of data and then it could metabolize a byproduct of nylon which has like a three functional group similarity with lysine.

Scientific theories aren't guesses as the uneducated believe. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I knew you would not answer. It seems even the uneducated can catch someone so well versed as yourself in a contradiction if they pay attention. This excuse doesn't change the fact that you refused to give the explanation for a phenomenon when you had already claimed there was an explanation. Then perhaps you will help pandion out, and explain gravity. Nice to see someone admit it. It does become tiresome to criticize the theory and be called ignorant of evidence due to this annoying dual use of the word. No, maxwells equations describe electromagnetism ; they do not explain them any deeper then the conceptual understanding of force fields and charges.

I have been trying to teach you but you don't seem to be able to learn. But gravity isn't evolution. Please try to pay attention. Don't be stupid. It is a matter of language that words have multiple meanings. Only the ignorant don't understand this fact. Since you are so ignorant of the topic, and refuse to make any effort to educate yourself, it is understandable that scientific terms that have different meanings from those that you understand are annoying.

First I am ignorant because I supposedly don't understand that theories explain, and are not facts ; now I am ignorant because I don't realize that words can have different senses of meaning depending on context. Are you noticing any pattern here? Shall we look back and see which of us happened to make a universal statement about what theories are? Do you happen to know a possible fallacy that arises from using the same word in an argument in two different senses? Don't worry my teaching is better than yours, I'll actually answer my own rhetorical question for you. It's call equivocation. And to what discussion is this diatribe meaningful?

Alright, have fun with that point. My point is and has been that mr. michael is correct in everything he said. There can be no rational non-causality, the supposition of non-causality is the supposition of irrational universe. I maintain that a dimension being a value on itself is circular contradiction. I deny that 0 = 1 - 1 is a model from the generation of existance from non-existance. If anything it represents the ultimate neutrality of a system with respect to the arbitrary zero point. An area totally devoid of force fields classically cannot exist in a universe with charges.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well, I guess if you don't get it, you don't get it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Was your pretty graph supposed to convince me that the universe can't be understood? Perhaps I was to intuitively understand that you're right :p<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I know I won't be able to convince you of anything, I don't know why I keep trying, guess it's just a flaw in my nature. Universe can be understood ( with in limits ) it's just not going to present it self as something we can instantly visualize and understand intuitively. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Thanks, but wait ; who's on first? You might be able to convince me that you really want to honestly debate me, but I doubt it.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I don't know what you mean, how have I been dishonestly debating you? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>You constantly quit under the excuse that even though you made an assertion any opposition to it is too foolish to acknowledge. You attack the character, intelligence, education, knowledge, and objectivity of me and others. You make absurd statements like " When you're explaining you're losing " in response to the ( compared to you ) extraordinary effort to clarify my position to you.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I guess it worded that poorly, I what I meant to say is, what makes you think I am debating you? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Rofl!, I promise you I did laugh in the hearing of others when I read that. No, you're quite right ; it would be a mistake to say you've ever put enough effort into any post to describe it as trying to debate. That however is dishonest in itself given that you are expected to argue when you assert things on a debate site.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Would you say that last little exchange we had about visualization and intuition was honest? <br><b>S1:7-  </b>Dangerously close ( it was also suspiciously similar to explaining!!! ). Except that you said these things in the same string : Unsupported. Unsupported. Ad hominem Ad hominem Science is not all of one piece. I think those who set themselves against problems with such an extreme lack of hard data are setting themselves up to fail. It's of course still not excusable that they think they can throw out human logic if they think the math or the reasoning is leading them that way, because of course math and reasoning are human logic. Sounds an awful lot like Aquinas ' defense of faith in which he basically said that men have to use their reason to conclude that faith is the only way to achieve the divine truths of the universe.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8435_584_83__586_592_596_597_603_604_607_608_610_611_613_614_6<br><b>S1:1-  </b>This universe or world could not have existed forever or had an infinite past, so it must have had a beginning. Things that begin to exist, don't cause themselves to exist ( that would mean that it would have to exist before existing, in order to cause its own existence ) Therefore there has to be some sort of being or power that caused the universe to exist, and this being itself must be infinite.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>In all his supporting arguments from the beginning there could have been alternate choices, he chose the ones that support his conclusion and the other choices are not mentioned but if so would be much more likely then saying god did it. His first post in this thread : There are two possibilities here, either time has existed forever or it didn't. He offers no supporting argument at all, exactly how did he determine that the universe had a beginning? At this point in our history no one knows which of the two possibilities are true. There is a third possibility as well, our brains are inadequate to really understand whats going on. How does he know, that things that begin to exist don't cause themselves to exist? Either it needs no cause or it does not need a cause or our brains are inadequate to really understand whats going on. Has to be some sort of being or power that caused the universe to exist? Again he fails to consider other possibilities. His arguments after that are just a more complex variations of the above. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Accipter, I would like to challenge a specific point you brought up ; you think that it is possible for things to cause themselves to exist. You seem to think that something can create itself. The reason I do not allow this as a possibility is because it is contradictory. For a particle to cause itself into existence means that the particle is the cause and also the effect. The cause is the effect at the same time and with respect to the particle itself. Another way of putting it, is that for something to have causal power, presupposes that there is    something    that exists. So for the particle to cause itself to exist, by its own power, would mean it would have to exist and not exist at the same time ( before it existed ) in the same sense. This is a text-book contradiction. You just repeated yourself.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Yes I think it is possible that " something can create itself " I also think it is possible that something can not create itself. When you are talking about something outside of our universe you can not assume that contradiction and causality will work the same way. Even inside our own universe there are things that contradict our experience and intuition for example black holes, how can a single point of zero dimensions ( the singularity ) have the mass of hundreds of thousands of suns? How could anything whose size is absolutely nothing even exist at all? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It sounds like you're saying causality and contradictions don't work at all. Whoa whoa whoa... that's not what I'm challenging. I'm not saying self-creation contradicts our intuition or experience, I'm saying self-creation is self-contradictory, thus making it a logical impossibility.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Virtual particles create themselves from nothing all the time all around us. The universe is a zero energy state, if you take all the positive energy and subtract all the negative energy you get zero, no power is needed to create it. " The theory of quantum electrodynamics describes nature as absurd from the point of view of common sense. And it agrees fully with experiment. So I hope you can accept nature as she is, absurd. " - Richard Feynman <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I'm not sure anyone would say that they literally create themselves, as you have done, but either way even stonewall would disagree with you since he said, " Conservation is maintained as the energy of the system never actually changes. " So to say they come from literally nothing is wrong, but that still doesn't deal with the logic of self-creation. Actually, " if you take all the positive energy and subtract all the negative energy " you do not get zero, you get twice the amount of absolute energy in the system. Even if I were to take the view that there is no imbalance in the universe's energy, that still doesn't mean it was uncaused... you're statement AGREES with me that it was caused, you just say that it was caused BY ITSELF. You are avoiding the fact that you said it created itself ( caused itself to exist ), and shifting gears to a position of it being created by nothing at all. Do you hold to this quote if ' absurd ' means contradictory? If so, then do you concede that self-creation is contradictory.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You are right I would not say it that way, I tried to put it in to words that are similar to what you are saying. What I would say is that virtual particles pop in and out of existence from nothing all the time, or virtual particles are created by nothing from nothing. The zero-energy universe thing was again me trying to put it into words that you could relate to, the correct way to say it is : The amount of positive energy in the form of matter is exactly canceled out by the negative energy in the form of gravity. Which ever way it is said the fact remains, it took nothing to create the universe, no power full omnipotent being needed. Feynman's quote says if your argument or logic or whatever does not match observation then there is a very strong possibility that it is wrong no matter how unbelievable that may seem. Another thing that is very possible is not that logic has failed it's your application of it which has failed. What created the universe was a quantum fluctuation and what created the quantum fluctuation is nothing. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I have to disagree with you on the idea that things can come into existence from nothing, by nothing, and for nothing, for reasons I've already stated. But either way, the specific point you stated that I was challenging you on can now be laid to rest.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Could you point out others who share your opinion? I am sure someone out there has pondered this question seriously and I honestly would like to read about it. As far as the issue being laid to rest I have to disagree. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I only challenged you on one specific point ; your view of a particle creating itself. To which you responded.. So you have conceded, and changed your phrasing to something different. Though I still disagree with what you changed it to, the specific point that I challenged is laid to rest because you are no longer holding to a self-created particle but rather to a particle created from nothing, by nothing.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Does it really make a difference to say particle creating it self from nothing or particle popping into existence from nothing? Might as well say it created it self, the result is the same. I would still like to see some references on your position or are you the only person in the world that believes what you believe? <br><b>S1:7-  </b>What would be the difference between saying a particle created itself from nothing or saying that something else created the particle from nothing, the result is the same right? The difference isn't in the FROM nothing, the difference is in the BY nothing ( the causal question ) and that makes all the difference in the world, especially between your view and mine. So yes, it does matter how you say it. My position on virtual particles being caused by something else? or the physical universe having a beginning?<br><b> S2:7-  </b>That the universe was created by god, and it is illogical to think otherwise.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7481_112_108__117_118_120_125_127_131_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Your challenge is so easy, I'm surprised you even bothered. Your whole world view is based on one assumption that has no hard evidence whatsoever. The existence of an almighty deity. Did you really think that it would be difficult to show that you are the one who is making assumptions that effect everything you believe? However, very few assumptions are made when dealing with scientific evidence. If someone were to look at your scientific evidence and find a glaring assumption had been made then you would be laughed out of the scientific community. It may be true that some of the more far reaching theories have gaps, due to unknowns, but to throw out all scientific knowledge from the base up just because we don't know everything is very short-sighted indeed. Smiley PS Make the next challenge a bit more of a.... challenge.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Again you allow your ignorance and denial of your spiritual humanity to cause you to make another incorrect assumption. And you do it with such bravado, it is laughable. I have first hand evidence that is available to all who seek it personally. The key word is PERSONALLY. God does not perform for crowds all the time regarding His personal love for us but He will always make a private appearance for those who will just seek Him personally. So don't think I am just hoping I will be proven right someday. I know I'm right regarding our origins and am just waiting for the precise details to be made clear to me. But this I do know for certain. That you are 110% wrong in you pseudo man made science that completely excludes the author of life in your equations. That much you can bet your soul on. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>So I was right. No real evidence.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Like I said smiley, I have my evidence and it's overwhelming. You need to seek it yourself and if you are sincere, you will receive it too. Besides, any evidence I present will only be scoffed at and rejected out of hand. But denying what I have personally experienced is a fools errand. But then again, coming from your ilk, it's par for the course. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Ever hear of Peter Sutcliffe? He had enough evidence of the existence of his god to go out and butcher 13 women. It certainly overwhelmed him. It's possible that he was delusional. But then again... Let's just hope your god doesn't ask anything similar of you. Smiley<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Smiley, if you weren't so utterly clueless regarding what it means to be born again you would actually be funny. But as it stands you are seriously pathetic for even attempting to lay this psychopath at Gods door in any way. During the time of their courtship, Sutcliffe had developed an obsession with prostitutes that he indulged together with a friend, Trevor Birdsall, and they spent a large portion of their spare time cruising red-light districts in the Yorkshire area. This obsession continued after their marriage and the acquisition of his HGV licence in June 1975, and his subsequent work as a lorry driver, took him away from home more than ever, enabling him to indulge his obsession without fear of detection. There is speculation that a bad experience with a prostitute, during one of these forays, led to the violent hatred of these women that resulted in the death of thirteen women, and the vicious attack of seven others. This is just such a great example of why it is a waste of time even attempting to reason with people with such limited understanding of who born again believers are to even think that this demon possessed sociopath was told to do this by God. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>He certainly believed in god, as he had had personal contact with him. So, did you happen to miss that bit? Or perhaps it was too inconvenient for you. Smiley<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Talks cheap smiley, I'm saying that if he truly had personal contact with the real and living God, he would have witnessed to those women rather than first pay them for illicit sex as he cheated on his wife and then butchered 13 of them because he had a bad experience with one of them. What I truly marvel at though about all of you hypocrites is that in all of my posts when i insist i have a personal relationship with God that is based on unconditional love, you demand proof. And yet, with this obscure serial killer who claims God told Him to do it and you hold him up as a believable example of what a christian is. Do you see why you are a tool of satan and an enemy of the God of love, and of all that is good and righteous?

Voyager is a good example of our continuing search to the edge of our Solar System and beyond. http://www.google.com/url?q=http://v...7hh5vgs_yiA_2A And isn't it true that scientists have dated the Universe by looking back to the beginning with Telescopes and extrapolating its age based on the speed that light travels from then until now and here? Did they account for the effect Solar Winds would have on the speed of light? Or the effect the varrying densities of the Space that light traveled through had on its speed over sucha vast distance? Of course they didn't and couldn't as that information is impossible to compile as it is a statistical unknown with no way to determine over such an incredibly vast distance of Space. So how do some confidently state that the Universe is 14 billion years old? They can't with any confidence. Yet they do. http://www.space.com/scienceastronom...se_030103.html<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Not exactly, but you don't care about the actual science so I won't try to explain it to you. We'll just use your erroneous example, since it's really close enough for this discussion. They can and do take those things into account. That's why they say it's 14 billion years old, instead of 14.12437845682376534756 billion. There are some factors that we can't pin down exactly, and they add a small degree of uncertainty. That uncertainty might add up to 100 million years. But out of 14 billion, that's not really a big problem. There is NO way the uncertainty could, for example, turn 14 billion into 6 thousand. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>So my example is erroneous but it's close enough not to correct huh? If it's so erroneous you would jump on the chance to prove me wrong. But even when I'm right, you must attempt to imply I am wrong. You're a perfect example of a philosophical coward kronos. So post a link saying my questions are incorrect if you can. And if you can't, stop making assertions you can't back up. Prove any of these huge assumptions. Don't you get it that none of what you are saying can be proven absolutely? You are placing a tremendous amount of faith in what you are saying above. None of which can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt by a preponderance the evidence. Huge assumptions must be made and held on to in order to accept most all of what this type of science asserts to be reasonable conclusions.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The measurments are based on the red shift of light, not on the speed of light.

The Bible tells us where we ( believers ) are going. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Have you refuted the evidence presented? You offer no positive evidence towards Creationism nor did you deny that the idea of Creationism as scientific was destroyed long ago.

Nope.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>What evidence? How about the flood? It was not " destroyed long ago ". People simply have begun to believe in evolution because they either : 1. ) Don't want to believe that the entire Bible is true. 2. ) They don't want to believe the Bible at all.

The Noachian flood did not occur. Ignoring the obvious impossibilities of the ship / animals / etc, we see that the results a global flood would have caused do not exist.

Can you PROVE it? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Huh? Yes, evidence is 100% evidence. That is not a prediction made by the global flood hypothesis. It can also be explained by climate changes. Rivers dry up.

Some biologists may study evolution, but biology is NOT evolution. Okay, what I meant to say is that you can't use the Catholic church as an example showing that the majority of Christians believe in evolution. ( ' Cause the Catholics don't believe a lot of things in the Bible. ) There is a hell. I just hope that you don't have to find out the hard way. Thistown : Sorry ' bout that. I was really tired and not thinking strait... see my post to Crim. See above... <br><b>S1:7-  </b>We know for certain that organisms change over time. No serious scientist ignores the fact of evolution. Biology is centered around the theory of evolution. Without it, biology is hardly biology. Of course I can.

Here are some other denominations which have supported evolution in past court cases : United Methodist, Episcopal, Presby, and Southern Baptist. Also, most Jewish groups.

Way to ignore the issue here. All of those products stem from applying the various sciences within evolution together through an evolutionary view. Creationism however, has absolutely nothing outside of publishing. A key determinant of validity in science is whether or not it can be made tangible. Creationism has nothing in that sense while evolution has hundreds. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Typical answer from a dishonest socially-inept evolutionist coward. Ignoring the real issue.

Btw, thanks for proving that creationists rely on dishonesty. Except that those fields of science in which those discoveries were made didn't exist without evolutionary theory. Many came from interdisciplinary fields united by evolutionary theory. Without that tie, we don't have those discoveries. Not to mention that many of those sciences are directly contradictory to literal creationism. The search for gas and oil deposits follows that of evolution, where diatoms lived, evolved and died in large concentrations, where large ancient swamps and forests were. Literal genesis however, doesn't suggest hydrocarbon formation, it argues that such deposits were created by the the flood. Aside from the sheer idiocy of that argument as it completely ignores physics, oil and gas deposits should, under that theory, be randomly scattered or should be evenly distributed everywhere. Obviously that is untrue. Literal Genesis viewpoints reject the necessary sciences to come to such findings and commercial products. So, no, you are wrong. Wrong again. I see you refuse to post in the informal challenge. Not surprising from a coward creationist. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I did not change the subject and you're the one who's dishonest. Biological evolution can be studied independent of the belief that all life evolved from a common ancestor. Wrong. You're using false dichotomies. You're assuming that if literal creation is not true, then that validates the theory of evolution, something that you accused creationists of doing. Hypocrite. I have never stated that I believe in creationism in any shape, way or form.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Because I said so! What are you, archangel? Did you really just say that? So the study of the change in species from one species to another can be done without the belief that species came from common ancestors? Really? The belief in a common ancestor is the study of biological evolution. It is simply an issue of how far one goes back. If two species evolved from one, and another species and that one evolved from a common one, how exactly are you going to propose we ignore history? Prove to me how geology is not contradictory to literal genesis. Explain to me how biology is not contradictory to literal genesis. Explain to me how astronomy is not contradictory to literal genesis. Show me a science that SUPPORTS literal genesis. The fabulous thing about evolution is that it can and has adapted to new finds in science. Modern evolution is very different from the ideas originally set forth by Darwin. But you, as a person who thinks that creationwiki is valid wouldn't know that. While it is possible that there is another alternative, the world was dominated by Literal Genesis.

I'm going to pretend that sciences on their own, not looking through evolution came to those conclusions! TROLL ALERT. Incorrect again. You claimed that those findings could have come outside of an evolutionary view. The problem is that there was no other view other then literal creationism.

On two other fora, it was raised by evolutionaries as a criticism of Christianity - the issue of eating shellfish. It was supposed that because the Old Testament prohibits the eating of shell-fish that Christians are hypocritical for doing so now. When a reply is put forward that man's understanding of the wish of God has changed, the say therefore the whole religion is in error! Now you're using that as a defence! Man is trying to understand the essentially unknowable God.

There you were the one arguing in favor of absolutes, so it was permissible to bring up the inconsistencies and arbitrariness of Church doctrine. Here, no one is making any claim as to the " absolute " nature of the theory of evolution. That theories change with time, or even discarded, as new evidence is uncovered ( or old evidence understood ) is part of the nature of science.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You've seen my stuff before? Where on www.abc.net.au? or creationtalk? Why didn't you say ' hi '? Anyway, this is a fair point I'm making. The eating of shell-fish is not an absolute. It was a law given to the Jews at a certain time. If such laws were absolute then they would have been given to Adam - i.e. from the beginning. Certain Church doctrine too is not absolute as we gain in our understanding of God. Arbitrary is such a loaded word and bespeaks of your bias towards the Church. It is difficult for me to argue against evolutionary theory when the theory itself is in total flux. It is difficult for me to understand the dogged defence it gets, when what you are defending today, could in fact be shown wrong tomorrow. Just as when Darwin and Huxley first had a go at Christianity, they knew nothing about irreducibly complex systems. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>CreationTalk, where I posted as the primitive hominid. I didn't say hi since I was curious whether you'd recognize me. But, hello Montalban. I hope you've been well. Anyway, my intention was not to derail the topic of this thread. Just to clarify that criticizing the belief system that changes is valid if it claims somehow to be absolute, but science always admits to being a changing enterprise.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>A generalisation with regard to Christianity. There are in deed absolutes, but there is no absolute really as to what all of them are. Most Christians would agree... there is a God Jesus is the Son of God Jesus came to earth as Man and died for us and for our salvation - and he rose again on the third day. However, it is not an absolute ( as far as I can see ) whether my priest has a beard, whether he faces the congregation at one point, and turns his back at another point. Likewise I don't believe that whether the earth is flat or not, or at the centre of the solar system is an issue. Further, I believe in a literal six day creation, but I'm not sure if Orthodox teaching means that the earth is young or not... Some monk tried to use the Bible to age the earth and came up with 7,000 years or so. I am not certain if this is Orthodox teaching. Certainly the six days is. Certain also is the fact that God is the creator.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-5417_65_58__71_77_84_91_101_103_117_124_128_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>If it frustrates you that you can't show any practical value, other than entertainment, religion bashing, and grant money, then get over it. No comparison in totals in tax breaks for churches, vs. total scientific funding. So science is in the business of trying to prove that there is no God?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>To be honest, I thought it had already been thoroughly answered by other posters. But if you want my twopennorth, here goes. The discovery of Tiktaalik was a " win " for science in two senses. First, it added to our knowledge of the processes involved in the emergence of the earliest tetrapods ; and second, it was a superb appilcation of deductive reasoning. The only person on this board to have taken the view that the discovery ' discredited religion ' is yourself. This discovery and religion inhabit separate realms of human thought and endeavour ; neither can ' discredit ' the other. Discrediting hair-shirt creationism is another matter ; but I for one do not equate that misguided worldview with religion. Are you suggesting that the only scientific research permissible is that which has a clearly defined practical goal? Presumably you would abolish cosmology as well ; not to mention pure mathematics. What an extraordinary non sequitur. Nothing in DamEtel's quoted text suggested anything of the sort. I can only assume that you equate ' explaining the natural world by means of natural mechanisms ' with ' trying to prove that there is no God '. Should scientists, then, be forbidden from undertaking such a quest? Are we really back there with Galileo and the Inquisition? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Third, it puts science closer to eradicating faith. Fourth, science knows it has much more political power if man is nothing more than an animal. Fifth, science can get more funding now for more expeditions. Sixth, it's better insurance to keep ID out of schools, to keep students from asking too many questions. Seventh, it gets closer to establishing atheism, no matter what the first amendment says. A big win for science, I'll agree.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Just for the moment let's put aside the issue of the discoverers ' intentions. Does this discovery, in your view, actually go any way toward ( to use your phrase ) ' discrediting religion '? Does it make a religious world-view less tenable than it was while the fossil still lay safely buried in rock? It's the only source of scientific knowledge ; and that's the only kind of knowledge the discovery of Tiktaalik provides. It says NOTHING about religion. If it contradicts creationist thinking, that is because creationists are trying to use religious precepts to make pronouncements on matters amenable to empirical analysis. When that empirical analysis shows them to be wrong, what it has demonstrated is not the falseness of religion per se, but the futility of applying its precepts to such a domain. Creationists complaining that palaeontologists are attacking religion are in roughly the same position as someone who takes his granny to a logging camp, stands her under a tree and then accuses the lumberjacks of trying to do her harm. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>YES, because of your #2 post. That is the first reaction of many people when they hear of a discovery like that. And many open minded people that read posts like that are taken in by them. Going back the the terms " appear to be ", " suggests ", " implying ", " look alike ", etc. - what we often have is science adding 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 and getting 1000. Several suggestions, some implications, an appearance, and ~ PRESTO ~ we suddenly have a scientific fact!! Now all the guesses that led up to the scientific fact are all but forgotten, and the new fact is used as a building block for still more facts, when THEY'RE added to a few apperances and implications. When it comes to writing history for millions of years ago, it's so easy to build it on human frailty. There would be no reason to stand granny under a tree. Creationists have reason to believe knowledge that is outside, and often above, science. Things like knowledge of human nature, and history.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>My #2 post drew attention to the often-repeated claim by creationists that transitional fossils don't exist. They do, of course, and Tiktaalik now adds another excellent example to the catalogue. If that makes people doubt creationism a little more, all well and good ; but I still don't see how that adds up to ' discrediting religion '. Being religious and believing the literal truth of Genesis 1 are not coterminous. We have the fact of the existence of an ancient vertebrate combining fish-like and tetrapod features. Your attempt to make terms like ' suggest ' and ' imply ' turn the whole exercise into fantasy and guesswork is an unconvincing exercise in equivocation. Our conclusion that the earth revolves around the sun is based on suggestion and implication : no-one has observed it. And there is no reason to bring religion into palaeontology. And if they insist on bringing that ' knowledge ' into conflict with palaeontology, and if ( inevitably ) it comes off worse, and if you are right and that discredits religion - who is to blame? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>It adds up to discrediting religion because it's obviously the most important part of the fossils ' discovery, and the associated theories that go with it. If this type of discovery were most important for enhancing man's knowledge, how come the most important part of that " IU scientist find possible missing link " thread was to put down creationists, even though none posted there? It's more convincing, when we look at this Richard Dawkins statement ; ( from his wikipedia biography ) How can you observe something while it's not happening? You have to WANT to see it really badly, to make a statement like that. A lot of suggestion and implication there. We have observed it a lot more clearly than we have events on earth millions of years ago. The one's who are doing the bringing. Human nature and written history from eyewitness accounts have been around a lot longer than palaeontology.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>This reply is so muddled and evasive I hardly know where to start. Palaeontology has nothing to do with ' human nature and written history ', and palaeontologists make no reference to such matters in their findings. And yet somehow, by your reckoning, they are deliberately effecting a confrontation with them. Palaeontology is the empirical study of ancient life forms as revealed by the fossil record - no more, no less. If creationists insist that its findings conflict with their beliefs, that is a battle of their choosing. Yes, in post #2 my first reaction to the Tiktaalik find was a reference to the problems it generated for creationists - but they are the ones who have put themselves in the frame with their insistence, contrary to all the evidence, that transitional fossils do not exist. Tell me, marc : in your view, should the study of palaeontology be forbidden? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>As we see from this link, palaeontology was originated by a Christian, Nicholaus Steno. http://www.edinburghgeolsoc.org/z_41_02.html Palaeontology started out secular, a study of material in the here and now using five senses in the present. It's 21st century definition shows that it, like much ( but not all ) of science has evolved into little more than atheist propaganda. It shouldn't be forbidden, but since it's largely a public endeavor, it should be policed by the political process - not by scientists alone, and not by courts alone.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Policed? I'm sorry, but I have this persistent vision of SWAT teams battering down lab doors and arresting scientists for illicitly uncovering a transitional fossil. Perhaps you'd like to refine the term. I'd also be interested to know what ' political process ' you have in mind. Presumably this would involve elected representatives passing legislation restricting what palaeontologists were allowed to investigate. Didn't I read in another post of yours that you were against bigger government? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>" Policed " probably was a poor choice of words. It's all about funding. Scientific exploration ( palaeontology & all the other branches of science ) seldom if ever discover noteworthy findings while opening their own wallets and providing the money. If they don't get government money, they can be free to do whatever they want of course. They can try to find someone in the private sector to help them prove atheism. Legislature and people getting more detail about where university grant money is going.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-5417_195_194__196_202_206_208_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>But when science presupposes no creator in it's " naturalisic " quest to make all its discoveries....<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You know, there are only so many times we can explain this to you, marc. If you simply refuse to give any weight to our points, even when you are utterly incapable of providing any reason not to accept them, there's really not much else we can do. May I recommend Dr. Kenneth Miller's book, Finding Darwin's God? Once again, just because you don't like certain facts doesn't make those facts false. I don't really want to delve too deeply into politics here, but the ignorance of the public ( and by ignorance I mean " lack of knowledge, " not " utter stupidity " ) regarding certain issues is not a sufficient reason for people in the know to play dumb. You elect representatives to educate themselves on the matter and make the decision for you. The U.S. is not a democracy, it's a republic ; and ( to paraphrase Churchill ) even though it sucks, it's better than any alternative. Ask Miller if he thinks Tiktaalik was a victory for atheism. Go ahead. Ask Catholics. Ask other theistic evolutionists. Or even ask an atheist who understands the implications of such things, because you obviously don't. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>From the link in post #1 of this thread ; This scientific study attempts to CLOSE gaps in the fossil record to show evidence of NO HIGHER POWER. Simple logic tells us that this study presupposed no creator. I guess you can, if that's all you can do. If you're incapable of condensing it and putting it into your own words in a brief way here, showing how Miller addresses the words " hope " and " fear ". I can see why you don't want to delve into politics too deeply - it may show you to be a liberal! :p Miller doesn't post here. I'm asking GazzaElliot. We'll give him more time - it obviously stumped you.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Your interpretation of the quote is belied by the quote itself, despite the fact that you cited the quote in its entirety. Filling gaps is a XXXX to those who believe that gaps are evidence of a higher power ; filling gaps is not in any way an attempt to disprove the existence of a higher power. But hey, you don't get simple logic, so what should we expect? Sorry, I've made it a point not to cater too much to your ignorance. If you want to deny that Miller actually believes the things he writes, you go right ahead. Frankly, your pulling out the " incapable " card is laughable at best. A non-response thinly-veiled as a backhanded ad hominem. Believe me, you're not fooling anybody.. except maybe yourself. You asked the question, and the mere existence of beliefs like those of Miller's refutes your assertion. If you dared take off your rose-tinted glasses regarding this evolution = atheism crusade of yours, you'd understand my point. However, as I pointed out earlier, your willful ignorance and close-mindedness render these conversations a lot like doing this : <br><b>S1:3-  </b>We just have different definitions of simple logic, that's all. You sometimes do a great job of answering your own posts. Read GazzaElliott's posts - you could learn something about debating.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But my definition is one that conforms to reality. I have to, because you never seem to do too well. In fact, if you had bothered to pay attention to my explanation of my use of the word ignorance in post 195, you'd have realized that I meant not " utter stupidity " but rather " lack of knowledge " ( in your case due to completely ignoring all disliked points ). Instead, you simply proved my point. What's this, yet another non-response with a thinly-veiled ad hominem attack? Now everyone can see why I have to answer my own posts...</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-5417_145_140__149_150_154_157_5<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I think that you are correct. While 99.9% of scientists are not creationists, it is alsonot safe to say that 99.9% of all ordained ministers and pastors ARE creationists. I have known many ordained ministers and pastors, ( Lutheran, Catholic, Methodist, Presbyterian ) that I knew when I was young or with whom I was stationed in the military or that I have known since. Most of whom were friends. None of them were " creationists " in the sense that you mean. All were men of God and Christians, and all accepted evolutionary theory as correct.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So the ordained ministers and pastors that you knew : Luthuran, Catholic, Methodist, Presbyterian, rejected not only the book of Genesis, but the books of Psalms, Jeremiah, Acts, Romans, First Timothy, Ephesians, James, and others? ( Creation is mentioned all throughout the Bible ). Did they believe in any of the Bible at all? How did they become ordained? Fundamentalist cults are the only ones who believe in the Bible? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Now you are being insulting and silly. Why play dumb? The narrow view of your particular cult is not generally held by most Christians. You are trying to pretend that " creationist " means anyone who believes in God as Creator. It doesn't. " Creationism " arose in the 1960 s as an anti-science movement, and " creation science " was invented in an effort to force the teaching of a particular cult religion in public schools. I think that the clergymen that I have known were better Christians than you. Also, more educated in the history and the theology of Christianity than you. It has nothing to do with belief in the Bible. It has to do with a failure to educate oneself in the history and the sources of the Bible.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If there's ever a prize for word games on these forums, your statement that I highlighted above would have to take it. SO IT'S POSSIBLE TO BELIEVE IN A CREATOR, YET NOT BE A CREATIONIST, ACCORDING TO YOU. It's no wonder naturalistic evolution is an " established " fact. Evolutionists seem to really have a way with words. If the ordained ministers and pastors that you knew believed in God as creator, ( BUT WERE NOT CREATIONISTS, DARN IT ) do they believe in naturalistic evolution? Do they believe that life originated from water as evolutionists seem to favor more and more, and also that man was formed from the " dust of the ground " as the Bible says? You said you knew them - come on tell me tell me, this oughta be good!!! <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yes. Most certainly. At least not in the common sense of the word, someone who believes that the earth was created from nothing in 6 days about 6000 years ago or some such mythology. It is foolish to believe that the Bible contains the literal account of how God created, especially since there are two different creation stories. Now what are you talking about. Since evolution has been observed, yes, it is a fact. The theory of evolution is the scientific explanation of why it happens. Yes. They did. I used to discuss it quite a bit with the chaplain of my artillery group ( Lutheran ). He lived in the BOQ and we used to spend lots of time on long drives to outlying batteries. He was smart enough to realize that the Bible can't be literally true in every detail - it isn't history, except in that it is the record of the Hebrew people with their Deity. From it we learn moral lessons. We learn that God is the Creator, not how he created. Science is working to explain how. Sure. Life probably originated in the water. It is silly to claim that man is dirt. No wonder christians have always been so willing to treat others as dirt. Wipe the foam off.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I knew it would be good. Creationists are only those who question atheist encroachment in our society. If a person believes in a creator, yet pays little attention to the politics of atheism, then they're not a creationist? - they're not subject to your creationist attacks. ( I wonder if they're offended, or take exception when you riducule creation. ) I don't think I've said anything about the exact time period the earth was created, or exactly how literal I believe the Bible to be, not only in this thread, but anywhere on these forums, ever. New heights for Strawman. Evolution definition number 389256. There are no moral lessons in it, if God is not the creator. God's creation of man ( however it happened ) is the foundation for all knowledge and moral lessons in the Bible. I am a Luthuran, and I know that Martin Luthur knew that much. EXPLAIN HOW??? I thought science and religion were separate!! You've changed your mind about God being the creator? Should we have religion in science classes now? Wouldn't that help them explain it? I knew it was gonna be good!!!</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10140_205_203__207_210_211_212_214_215_222_4<br><b>S1:1-  </b>go back to the post where you said " abiogenesis is an integral part of evolutionary theory ". then view my reply of links disproving that statement, including the link YOU POSTED in order to try and prove that very statement. tell me, how have ants served you today at all? made you a sandwich? you were the one claiming God put every animal on the earth to serve us, so back that statement up by telling me how ants, cockroaches, fruitflies, earwigs, centipedes, termites and grasshoppers have served you. all of them, because remember, God put all of them on the earth to serve us. did grasshoppers make your shoes? i am the one claiming they are NOT here to serve us, they all make up the intricate biosphere, and we are a part of that family - there are no slaves. you realize that when we sequence the DNA of any animal, they ALL fall into a hierarchy, right?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>WOW, your ignorance and narcissism is astounding. But I shouldn't be surprised that your secular humanistic mind can only think in terms of what affects you directly as an individual mattering to you specifically. It doesn't work that way with me at all. I learned long ago that we either rise together as a species or we fall together. That means that each and every creature on Earth has a purpose in balancing the chain of life with whatever contributions their lifecycle contributes to the environment they live in. Ants aerate the earth and scavenge living and dead insects which serves a valuable service to the world. And every insect you mentioned above contributes to a balanced ecosystem in their own way so they most definitely benefit me personally with their existence. And I will hate to see the impact mass animal extinctions have on us and our planet / chain of life when the Tribulation period starts and massive segments of animal species are wiped out through war and pestilence. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>way to change your argument from ' all animals are here " to serve our needs " ' to ' all animals serve the purpose of " balancing the chain of life " '. FENCE POST MOVER!! you and freedom could be best friends.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>IT'S THE SAME THING, MONGO!!! Unless someone is as self centered as you apparently are. Is it beyond you to grasp that because all animals contribute to a balanced chain of life, they also serve our needs as human beings even if we don't consume some of them for food? But I'm hard pressed to name any animal, insect or bird that isn't consumed by some culture somewhere on earth. I myself have been offered chocolate covered ants in my lifetime, and it is common knowledge that insects are high in protein and recommended eating if one is in the wild and hungry. It is also common knowledge that other cultures find insects to be a delicacy. So I haven't moved any fence post at all, you just refuse to, or are incapable of grasping my point, as usual. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>i never said anything about eating or food ( other than ants making you a sandwich ). how about parasitic organisms? tapeworms - how do they serve us?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Truthfully, I don't know, but since I'm not the end all and be all of human knowledge I don't feel obligated to have to come up with an answer for that. Besides, I'm not even sure those examples fall into the category of animals beneficial to the chain of life since they are parasites rather than animals found in the wild. They live off of animals rather than as creatures who live independent of other living creatures. For example, take cancer ; do you believe God created cancer? I don't believe that at all. Cancer and all diseases are the result of our fallen nature. Death came into the world because of sin, sin is the great enemy of Man and is why we get sick, age and die. Don't misunderstand me though, when a baby is born deformed or handicapped it isn't necessarily because of any specific sin he or his parents committed. It is a result of the general human condition called the sinful nature. That is, if it wasn't caused by some unknown environmental contributor which is also caused by our fallen nature given it exists because of some general social ignorance. Love Canal comes to mind as one such example. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>hahahaha! parasites are animals. many, many animals are parasitic, all of which you claim God created in order to serve us. all species that belong to the animalia kingdom of life are animals, and tapeworms do fall into that kingdom. and to say that God created all animals to serve us, thats saying God created ALL animals to serve us, including parasitic tapeworms. now, it should be a perfectly answerable question - how have tapeworms served you personally? or how could tapeworms serve anyone? the answer is they do not. that is not their purpose, as with every other animal or plant. they are not here to be our servants or for our entertainment. so let me get this straight. if a child is born with no defects or diseases, thats God's miracles, but if a child is born deformed, thats nature and God has nothing to do with it. what, in that instance, God just turns his back and pretends that he didnt notice? no again! a child born normally is nature just as a deformed child is nature. picking and choosing positive things God does and calling the negative things in life " nature's doings " has a name - it's called cherry-picking. also, thank you for cutting the ad hominem attacks and insults. its much appreciated.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Based on this condescending and argumentative reply, your thanks might be a bit premature. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>are you going to respond? you responded to the post, but not the argument. it seems like a re-occurring theme with you.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10140_192_191__200_203_204_206_208_209_224_226_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>To date, there has not been conclusively identified even one direct-line ancestor for modern man.

The Bible says " come let us reason together ". Even the creation account in Genesis commands man to master the earth. To master a thing you must understand it. Additionally it is of paramount importantance to any Christian that the Bible backup it's claims. If it cannot be trusted as " the word of God ", but rather as some run-of-the-mill do-good book, then how can the Christian be certain that what they believe in is truth, or a bunch of hocus pocus? Afterall, the VERY SAME book that claims that God created the earth aproximately 6000 years ago also claims that Jesus was the son of God, and you should believe in Him. If one of these claims can be proven incorrect, how can the other be trusted?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Lots of us don't take the Old Testament too seriously as anything more than a set of morality and origins tales dating from the Bronze Age or even earlier. In the light of scientific knowledge, it would be pretty silly to take them as scientific descriptions of prehistoric events, and where they contradict reality, such as in the tale of Noah's Ark, they need to be discounted as anything more than a myth. It's not that myths don't have some heuristic value, but they shouldn't be taken too literally, otherwise we would have to regard Aesop's fables as all literally true. And I don't think even bibliolaters would want to go that far. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Creationists use geneoligical records in the Bible which go from creation to Jesus Christ in about 4004 years. As a matter of historical record, most agree that Jesus was on the earth about 2000 years ago ( perhaps 2007 years ago? ), hence approximately 6000 years. Two points here ; first, that is not what the Bible claims itself to be. It claims itself to be the infallible Word of God. Secondly, the truth is unaffected by popular opinion. With new evidence, or better interpretation of existing evidence comes a change in the popular perception of the truth. Each of us has an opinion on the truth based on our worldview. That worldview effects how we process or interpret the evidence we see. Consider : creationists and evolutionists have the same rocks, the same fossils, the same " evidence ". Both interpret that evidence differently to support their presuppositions in light of their understanding of the world in which they live -- basically filtered through the lens of their worldview. For the creationist, the Bible is their list of presuppositions. For the evolutionist, materialism, naturalism, and uniformitarianism are the underlying presuppositions. Presuppositions are required for interpretation of evidence who's formation was unobserved.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Unfortunately, the worldview of the Creationist is based on mythology ; the world view of the scientist is based on empiricism. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I guess a creationist might ask how many empiricle evolutionists were present at the formation of the universe to observe it, or how many observed the first forms of life, or how many eyewitnesses there were to observe the first stages of evolution. A creationist might wonder how any empiracle process can be based on such little observation. A creationist might point out the number of " missing links ", and wonder how something that is missing and unobserved can be considered empiracle. To the creationist, the evolutionary worldview looks like the mythos, and their creationist view is supported not only by their interpretation of the evidence, but by eyewitness testimony ( the Bible claiming to be the Word of God ). The creationist models have the sea floor lowering over time, while mountainous regions lift, yes. There are deep crevaces in the middle of the pacific ocean. IF the earth were to rip open and enough water the cover the whole earth came out, there would be a void where the water came from. Additionally, there would be a lot of weight on the crust pushing it downward into the void. Actually, most creationists would argue that. see http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v18/i1/oldearth.asp<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I guess a scientist might ask how many Creationists there were as eyewitnesses to god writing the book of Genesis. History leaves its mark in geology and biology. Scientists read and interpret it. All Creationist do is read their bibles, which will teach them nothing about history. A scientist might wonder how Creationists have the cheek to pontificate about science when they know so little biology, geology or even plain physics. A scientist might point out how many mistakes there are in the bible if it is read literally. A scientist would conclude a Creationist can't tell logos from mythos and keeps mixing them up to preserve a discredited literalist interpretation of their bible. Where were the so-called eyewitnesses who saw all this creatin ' goin ' on? Creationist " models " are pure fiction with no science to back them up. They exist solely to explain away the vast errors found in literal interpretations of the bible. They are good for a laugh, but no more.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-6050_189_187__190_192_194_195_197_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>And look what it's done to you. That's what I used to think. They only agree because you want them to. It's easy to rationalise using alleged perspective, but there's a plethora of contradictions and anomalies available for perusal on the ' net. Simply because you said the rainbow meant destruction by fire ( which it didn't ). In my previous post I've put it down to semantics. Agreed that it's nothing further from the truth. But I didn't say that. Look at the punctuation. As for the rest of your interpretation of Revelation, I have no problem in essentially agreeing with you to a large extent in that is what the Bible is saying. The slight problem is the veracity of the claims...<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It isn't my job or intent to try to make you believe as I do charlie. In the end we all travel this journey of life alone so believe what you will and good luck with that. I also find it interesting that your avatar represents the bleached white skull of a dead bull. Could that be some prophetic irony? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The last few exchanges are easily summed up, Arch. On the contrary, I learned plenty about the Bible and Christianity. I revelled in it. The real learning comes when you stand outside the box and look in, and analyse dispassionately. No one wants to die if they've got their marbles and health. In those circumstances, very few want to choose when and how to die. I want to live forever. There's a lot to learn. Learning would never cease. A lot of people want that. But not to the point of self-delusion. The real world is here and now. At least you've got a sense of humour. But I find it infinitely more tasteful than the tortured body of a man hanging from the murder weapon.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Are you saving money and investing for retirement Charlie? How about auto and health insurance in case of an accident or illness, do you prepare for that future possibility? Then why isn't preparing for our eternal future just as important as spiritual beings? And more importantly, how is preparing for that time denying or avoiding " the real world in the here and now "? You make no sense for one who claims to have studied the truth. I haven't noticed any avatars on this site of Jesus hanging on the Cross. Can you point it out please? Mine represents the " Lion of Judah " who as you can plainly see is very much alive and well, and beautiful too. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It makes no sense to you, Arch, because you think you have found The Truth. Nothing outside of that will influence you. The Truth is a prison for the mind. Yes, I studied The Truth for years. As ultimately there wasn't a shred of evidence for it, apart from wishful thinking, getting out was supreme sense. Did I infer that? I see crucifixes adorning necks every day. Look at me ; I'm a Christian. Or else it's a hypocritical sham. Every day I see roadside crucifixes - sometimes up to 4 m high - and shrines. The reference wasn't directed at you, Arch, but the Christian in general and their use of sick imagery.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I don't think I know the truth charlie, I know it. The Holy Spirit of God which indwells me assures me of my eternal standing as His child. You are perfect evidence of the difference between studying The Truth and Knowing It. Had you truly possessed the Holy Spirit and knew the Lord, you wouldn't be rejecting Him as foolishness now. Yes you did infer it since my original statement was referring to avatars and had nothing to do with Crosses in general. You should have been more clear about generic crosses you see in your everyday travels. Also, it's worth pointing out that the Cross isn't a symbol of death as you see it but is a symbol of resurrection and eternal life. I'm really starting to doubt you ever went to any type of Bible College as you have no understanding about what is even believed. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>@ Archangel - I've tried to be polite and at least try and educate you, but in this I have singularly failed. This is self-opinionated and staggering arrogance of the first order, and wouldn't be uttered by a true Christian who knew the Bible. Did you never read Matt. 24:13? He that endures to the end is the one that will be saved. You've already decided that you've got eternal standing before the end. Secondly, whilst tough debate is not for the squeamish and those of delicate sensibilities, you regularly pen spiteful comments in your replies ( as evidenced to other posters in this thread. ) That is not in the true spirit of debate either, even allowing some leeway. By your example it is difficult to conclude that you are an ambassador for Christ ( 2 Cor. 5 : 20 ) and that a belief in God is worth pursuing. You have all the appearances of an internet troll.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-2325_72_71__74_75_78_82_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Some more thoughs on darkness ( as in what you get at night ) : It is an effect that humans percieve because of the sensitivity of our visual senses. It occurs because of a lack / abscence of light. So isn't light / dark just like hot and cold? Both dark and cold occur when there is a lack of something ( ambient light, thermal energy ). Both are a subjective human perception resulting from the sensitivity of our sensory systems. Both ambient light and heat can be objectively measured, but not in a way that directly equates to human perception. We can say wow, its cold today and measure the ambient temperature to find it is 2 degrees celsius. We can then say when the ambient temperature is 2 degrees celsius its cold. Likewise we can measure the Light Value of a subject. We might say its dark at the moment and the LV is - 14. We could when there is a LV of - 14 a person would percieve darkness. All this non-material stuff is like playing with smoke and mirrors and making confusion over something we can describe and quantify, certainly in terms of our own perceptions.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So you describe darkness by a negative ; lack of light. Light is material, and can be measured, if you take all that light-material away you are left with an area that is material-less, or non-material. It is darkness. It is real in so far as it exists ; affecting animals, plants etc. It is non-material in that it can not be measured ; because there isn't any ' materail ' there to measure ; despite Mach's unsupported claim to the contrary. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not a negative but an absence off, like with my comparison with hot / cold. The " negative " is a product of our perception - if I take my same example about the light and apply the same conditions to a cat, it does not perceive darkness as we do due to the sensitivity of its senses ( in this case because of the high proportion of rods to cones in the retinas of its eyes ). Why do you say it cannot be measured? we measure the available light and that gives us an understanding of how light / dark it is. We could say zero light would equal absolute darkness ( as in absolute zero, 0 K is in the Kelvin temperature scale ). That is our measure of darkness. Darkness is no more immaterial to light than the zero energy state absolute zero is to heat.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Show me the test to measure darkness. What is the speed of dark? Your belief is un-scientific, as far as I know science can only test for what ' is ' ; as in material. I could be wrong, but no one has yet shown me a science ' test ' for something that doesn't exist in material. It can test for light ; heat ; sound ; etc. Thus it can give properties of each ; a speed of sound ; a speed of light. There is no speed of cold, of silence, of darkness. A ' measure for darkness ' is not gained by measuring light. Measuring light is measuring light. If you argue that darkness is material, show me what it is made of. If you argue that darkness is non-material, then you can't suggest science can measure it. This is after-all a foundation of the claim of Mach et al ; that science can know everything there ' is '. It must be shown how science measures ' it ', or he and others have to face the fact that althought ' it ' is... it can't be measured by science. However, I am unsure if this relates to dark matter ; which has not been observed ; only its affects on matter have been observed. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Perception, perception, perception! we can quanitatively test for the light and the heat, that is all that is actually " there ". The cold and darkness are only concepts of description that our minds use to desribe the lack of heat and light. We could discard dark and cold completely and describe everything in terms of warmth and light.......... it just wouldn't be as articulate for describing the world we perceive. What is darkness made of? it is all the material world around us. We just don't always perceive it because of the presense of light. Forget dark matter..... thats another issue of perception ( ie. the capabilities of our current sensing equipment ).<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are the one who said it was nothing but a concept post #78 Thanks, but it doesn't help your argument... whatever that happens to be. So, you're saying I should do research to support some position you have, whatever that position is at the moment? It is rathe pointless, ' light ' is material. Darkness is not. Then show me the facts. Funny debate! So, you're opinion is not just an opinion, but based on facts which are ' somewhere ' on Google. This is convincing stuff.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8409_524_523_1_525_527_528_529_530_531_532_533_534_535_536_11<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Accipter is an agnostic not an atheist.

An athiest is not just ' someone who believes in no God '. It broadly means ' someone who does not believe in God ' - the people with faith in God's absence are just a subset of all those who don't have faith in His presence. Like I said, ( a ) theism is a dichotomy. You either believe in a God, or you don't - you can be a skeptic, but you still have to lie on one side or other of that dividing line. Your attempt to label this as ' pedantic ' is ironic, coming from someone who's currently trying to tell me what my beliefs ( or lack thereof ) are. ( Oh - and who just took the time to look up and post the definition of ' pedantic '. ) Agnostic atheism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>An Athiest is someone who denies the existence of God.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Atheism is anything that has no belief in God.

Please try to keep up!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Any my point is that, since Accipter has no belief in God, he is. Denial of God is sometimes a feature of atheism, but it is not necessary. I'm way ahead of you. The bolded part is entirely false. Insisting otherwise may not be pedantic, but it definitely indicates that you've been using the wrong terminology for years now and are reluctant to change. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>No, you are still trailing way behind.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>... it only looks that way to you because we're going in circles.

I never stated an opinion, I provided definitions to prove that Accipiter was not what he said he was.. and succeeded<br><b> S2:5-  </b>The opinion you've implied is that the definition you linked to is the only one for atheism that applies. The opinion you've stated is that an agnostic is someone who ' denies true atheism '. Both of these opinions conflict with my citations. Both of these opinions are incorrect. I don't disagree with your definitions - just your citations. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I think Accipter cant call himself an atheist Where have I implied an agnostic is someone who denies true atheism. I have made very simple and accurate definitions and reached a conclusion using those definitions.. the rest is in your head<br><b> S2:6-  </b>The exact phrase you used was ' does not profess true atheism ' - post #526. It is false because it implies that ' true atheism ' is different from what it is. As I showed before - ' denial of god ' is just one subset of non-believers, all of whom are ' true atheists '. Accipter can call himself an atheist for the same reason that I can - we have no belief in God. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>An Athiest is someone who denies the existence of God.

Fallacies are a creationist's best friend. You claimed : " have never shown to add any new structure or even a new part to any existing structure. " Now you are changing your argument away from structure as new proteins and especially enzymes ( which are proteins ) don't count. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>first of all, the claim is that random changes in molecules do not produce bodiliy structures. Proteins are molecules and are thus not what I was referring to. Second, there are no new enzymes or new proteins produced by any mutations... and not only that but none of those mutations have been shown to be random. So for all the billions of bodily structures in the world, ToE cannot account for even ONE of them.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Since when was evolution defined by the presence of new body parts? Except that proteins are in fact structures and play a huge role in organisms. To deny them as relevant is to essentially say that your body isn't important. Without proteins and their functions, life cannot exist. Incorrect. I provided two links showing that claim you regularly spammed as false. How many times have you been refuted on that? 10? 15? 20? 100? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>so of all the animal kingdom, the evidence that mutations can create new sturcutures has been narrowed down to two proteins.

All dogs and wolfs are the same species, any breed can mate with another and produce offspring. What you see in dogs is the power of selection not speciation. All those breeds of very different looking dogs shows the variable potential within the original animal that can be achieved through selection.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Polar bears and kodiak bears are the same species? Zebras and horses? Only because it is unlikely that mammalian advancements would be abandoned. However I am sure an operational gill would be of great help to modern sea mammals. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species you can't just do anything your out of control imagination wants, i don't think it's unreasonable to assume that there are limits here in the real world. As for the development of lungs into gills i don't know if it is imposable but does not seam likely. Further their are no examples living or dead of lungs evolving into gills but plenty of examples living and dead of gills becoming lungs.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Oh, yes I forgot if you actually answered my question that would mean you were explaining and we can't let that happen can we. What are you talking about out of control imagination? We don't know what causes advancement so how can we know what it's limits are? What of having lungs and gills? That is because there is more oxygen in the atmosphere than dissolved in water. Aerobic life would have no selection pressure to abandon such a rich source of oxygen that doesn't mean it wouldn't be beneficial to also have access to dissolved oxygen. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If you ask me the definition of a word I would post a link to the word in a dictionary, what's wrong with that? I agree their are factors in the environment which put limits on which way things can go. I don't see dolphins really needing gills, they are total viable with out them, why do you see dolphins with gills as an advantage?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>1. I did not ask for the definition I asked about two specific cases. 2. Wikipedia is not a dictionary. You sound like genesis, it doesn't matter what you think ' is needed ' natural selection is not an intelligent force prompted out of slumber by the dire upcoming fate of necessity like it is painted. Fish are totally viable, and were totally viable ; but that doesn't mean there was not a better form of life that would out compete other fish. Births would be less risky ; they could stay underwater longer, which means deeper dives, longer hunts, and better ability to hide if needed. Now when certain amino acids are selected among others for lower nutritional cost this would be a mountain. It is not happening because the system does not exist, not because it would not be advantageous. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Do birds need jet engines? No they don't, but boy it would sure be a tremendous advantage! Evolution is driven by the environment, if a species can reproduce and maintained great enough numbers their would be no pressure from the environment to change. Lots of organisms have not changed since their arrival, what requires them to increase their " performance "?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Evolution as we know it is driven by benefit that allows for greater reproductive success and that encompasses everything. There is always pressure where there is reproduction and death. Whether anything changes depends not on whether something else would be better but on whether a change was beneficial. So no, you are dead wrong. It doesn't matter how many of a species is flying or running about, if a change is beneficial ; say a jet engine. It will be selected. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Why are there no dolphins with gills?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I don't know if you are the same one who made the mistake before, but you are confusing the inefficiency of the motor with the inefficiency of the system. Massive energy is wasted in the free burning of hydrocarbons to heat. If you could effectively transmit bio-chem energy to a neodymium electric motor ( just an example ) you would see how absurd it is to consider limbs more efficient than rotary devices in these cases. I do admit limbs are far more versatile for such creatures that need it. Why are there dolphins? Until we know how novel systems come about we can't know why some are generated but others are not. The easy answer would be to say that the function is IC ( like all systems ) and it cannot just spontaneously form, but that is true of gills and lungs even in their respective species. Obviously they do exist so something made them. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>What made icicles?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>The consistent stability preference for hydrogen bonds of a certain geometry combined with the random interaction of water particles. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>You left out the temperature, the substrate on which they formed, gravity, precipitation, the atmosphere, wind and on and on. A more complete answer would have been, the environment made them.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>Temperature and pressure are requirements, the rest contribute to the random interactions. No what gives snow flakes their ordered shape is what I described. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Snowflakes? What happened to icicles? Did you make a mistake?<br><b> S2:8-  </b>I thought you did. I have no idea what relevance icicles would have. I shall read it if I get a chance. Well actually accipiter said it, but I do think that a jet on a bird as an emergency addition to a turbine system would be of great benefit if not because it can cruise efficiently. Wings and legs are an advantage of their rotary equivalents for other purposes. In straight propulsion though they do not compete. <br><b>S1:9-  </b>Well I guess that snowflakes would do just as well because they are also unique in shape and a product of their environment. You trying to tell me that the environment is not responsible for shaping the things and organisms with in it is simply inane. You have put yourself in a position where your arguments must become increasingly ridiculous to defend the foundational argument. You have invented your own special physics to create a universe that fits your arguments which would not work and you are the only person in the entire world who believe it is correct. You are a complete waste of time, I insult myself by discussing anything with you.<br><b> S2:9-  </b>Their ordered shapes are not the product of the environment, are not explained as opposed to any other solid by the environment. That is correct. The environment is a factor, not a cause. You are saying that rain created umbrellas and I am saying umbrellas were created to defend against rain. This is very simple stuff they would teach you in any logic course. This idea that the environment is the only variable which contributes to reproductive success is one of the consistent fallacies young evolutionist are brain washed with. I suppose it is in hope of eventually turning out one of you who seem to ascribe mystical powers of generation to the environment. I have been accused of believing in a ' perfect ' version of an organism or a system in an organism, yet what does it imply when you think every selection pressure is in equilibrium just because gene frequencies aren't shifting? It means you think there is nothing left that will grant reproductive success, it means you think that in the context of the current environment the species is perfect. Problem is I don't measure ridiculousness by how divergent it is from other's beliefs. Further I have not noticed a significant increase in disagreement. lol It's your perverse idea of ' discussion ' that insults you.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8409_692_691__693_694_695_697_5<br><b>S1:1-  </b>the eye would have formed under positive selection pressure. meaning, no specific event needs to take place, per say. what i mean by positive selection pressure is that alleles increase a trait which succeeds instead of alleles decreasing and getting rid of negative traits, leaving only positive traits. the way the eye formed was probably not with negative pressure, seeing as with the progressions of the eye, animals will avoid predators instead of the negative alleles being eaten. genetic drift means a general change in the pattern and prevalence of a given interval in a species undergoing a genetic change. the name implies not a stillness but a movement from one point to another. and with the genetic drift formulas, we can predict the outcome of an interval based on known variations and knowing what they do. which is exactly what you proposed with guided mutation.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The specific events of the mutations would have to take place and selection events would have to follow.

Can you explain what you think it is in terms of selection pressure? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>it was quite a long time ago when i read the book, ive forgotten most of it, and like you said it was quite confusing to begin with so im not sure i understood it when i read it. but ive researched a number of creationist arguments and the evolutionist responses, especially the dover trial. by your definition of IC ( something that could not have come about by a process ), it can not be applied to selection pressure, since selection pressure involved a number of evolutionary processes.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well that is one of the definitions but that statement is also equivalent to that which cannot have positive selection pressure until it exists. It if fortunate that I do not agree with your attitude that one must read every possible article or book on a subject or else I would declare you to ignorant to discuss IC :p <br><b>S1:3-  </b>i didnt claim that you must read every book on evolution in order to discuss it, i said you have to have an understanding of the evolutionary process and you get that through reading some of the basic evolutionary literature - it appears to me that you have less than satisfactory understanding of the evolutionary process, seeing as you asked me to provide a link between intermediate forms and the evolutionary process when the answer is very obvious and direct to a person with basic understanding of evolutionary theory. you claim to be neither a creationist nor an evolutionist, but youve read at least two creationist books that i know of, probably more, and zero books on evolution, yet you claim to have a good understanding of both, and an unbiased opinion on both. somehow i doubt that.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are right that is an exaggeration of what you said. I do have an understanding of both the proposed and actual evolutionary process and from my perspective it is greater than average. I disagree, I am sure if you provided the point as a formal argument I would be able to show you what I mean. By your definition Behe is a creationist, and so are his books for they conclude ID. IC didn't need a book for it's own definition and neither does evolution. I have speculated before and asked you to correct me if I was wrong but I think The Origin of Species contains mostly chapters on evidence and ties them together with the theory briefly perhaps in two pages? Yes You may doubt but I cannot see that doubt as relevant. It's a boolean measurement, if you mean how does one go about measuring IC's implications to random chance I would say the genetic differential should be that meter. Yes, that was the point of the guided mutation formula / test. It's not a scientific theory it's an argument, you evaluate arguments you don't study them like a field of knowledge.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8409_356_349__359_360_361_362_365_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>So according to you, evolution admits it doesn't know?

There was nothing wrong with my answer. I did the correction after being insulted, double-standard huh. I am not entitled to my own opinion if it doesn't agree with yours. I expected alot more from you, you've let me down. Your obviously only looking at one side of the argument.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So why should you care about their non-scientific beliefs in a debate on science? Most people who believe in evolution do so because of science, so their non-scientific beliefs are irrelevant. I agree, this wasn't targeted specifically at you, which was why I said there were other people who do these things besides creationists. Again, this wasn't just about you and me. I do think you corrected someone's spelling and if you didn't it was another creationist. What does spelling have to do with your own opinion? Again this isn't just about you although I think you did resort to correcting someone's spelling and just didn't answer the question. This has nothing to do with being entitled to your own opinion.

It is based on a web of lies, ignorance and baseless claims. Claims that systems " must have been designed " can be scientifically objected to, what can not is supernatural or religious claims. It is the " creation scientists " attempt to prove their religious theses with science which is the problem. The idea that evolution is contrary to god is an idea that you and other creationists alone hold. The morality of creationism is this ; to lie, to speak of things which you are ignorant while claiming to be an authority, to use any means, regardless of how dishonest or fallacious to convince an audience of your correctness, to appeal to their emotions and ignorance rather than their minds. Is the intentional spreading of ignorance a " morality " we should be concerned about? Absolutely. Is the creationist movement a threat to science? Absolutely, in America. That wouldn't prove they are the same... " ID " and " creation science " both claim to scientifically prove creation, how does this show science is contrary to a belief in supernatural creation?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What's the difference between creation science, and supernatural creation? Claims that systems " cannot have been designed " in spite of very recent discoveries of the complexities of life, can also be scientifically objected to. It is " evolutionists " who often attempt to prove atheism with science that is also a problem. Nah, anyone who reads the hatred of religion and God on these forums knows it too. Sounds like exactly what goes on in todays universities about evolution! Really, the morality of creationism is largely that man is on a level above animals. That is a key difference between creation and evolution. If man is a mere animal, a creature of instinct, he is malleable to state control ; he can be trained and bred like any other animal. It also lays foundations for governments to control human reproduction and family size. Life and Death can be defined by science through it's definitions of several stages of brain death ; science can determine the differences in worth between a newborn and a fetus etc etc. These things make a world of difference in how today's science operates, and how it's funded. By opposing any type of study that's not based on atheism. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Show me these claims. Evolutionist is a made up word and doesn't have a clear meaning, it apparently means " duh I went to creationist university and don't know the differenace between a biologist and a paleontolgist ". Show me these " evolutionists " who attempt to prove atheism with science. It appears to me they are a figment of your imagination. No, the morality of creationism is to make up a bunch of XXXX and use dishonest means to try and give it scientific credibility. Man can be evolved and be on a level above the other animals, or created and on the same level as them. You are correct however that many creationists see the acceptance of their thesis as a great moral struggle - they are so willing to misrepresent the truth because they believe they are doing god's will.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Enthusiastic ( or maybe panicky ) attempts throughout the scientific community to " disprove " irreducible complexity. Ever hear of Carl Sagan? Richard Lewontin? How about Richard Dawkins, and his book, " The Blind Watchmaker "? Or the website talkorigins? No, it's the morality of atheism that attempts to do that. That is true for many worldviews, as long as they reject the Bible. And the enthusiasm ( or panic ) of evolutionists to oppose it shows that they have an equally great moral struggle - to misrepresent things and fill gaps, to establish atheism. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Irreducible complexity is the claim something must have been designed, since it cannot have evolved. You claim scientists set out to prove things " cannot have been designed ". Are you lying, or simply in need of a lesson in basic comprehension? Show me where they claim or attempt to " prove atheism ".<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Comprehension? My claim " cannot have been designed ", and " to disprove irreducible complexity ", go together well. This is from the preface of Dawkins book, his words ; http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/...tchmaker.shtml The " ONLY KNOWN THEORY " - No God. Atheism means " Disbelief in, or denial of the existance of God or gods. http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=atheism I can't make it any clearer than that. It's also obvious that Dawkins does a good job of " persuading the reader " too, considering this review from the same link ; Reviews of Dawkins ' book show that many thousands, ( if not millions ) influenced by Dawkins book hold it too. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>And surprise surprise there is nothing about proving atheism there. You may interpret his words in an odd fashion to come to that conclusion, you wish to imagine that is what he is saying. Dawkins explicitly notes that some things, like god, unicorns or leprechauns can not be disproven. What dawkins shows is that neither god nor leprechauns are necessary for explaining the origins of mankind. Does this disprove god? Is it an attempt to? Absolutely not. Similarly, showing that things can evolve ( through disproving irreducible complexity ) does not show that they must have evolved, it leaves open the possibility they were designed by an enclave of rebel unicorns and leprechauns. So basically what we have here is another example of dishonest / ignorant creationist argument ( the lines are somewhat blurred ). Creationists who have never read authors, except for quotes from creationist websites, taken out of context, claim to know what these authors " really mean " and end up attributing to them views they do not hold.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8309_22_20__23_24_27_28_30_32_34_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You're the one that's ignorant.

The two belief systems are as diametrically opposed as night and day and you can't believe one without corrupting the other. In order to accept evo you must disregard key elements of Genesis and other scriptural principles which God declares are absolute. I admit I can't explain the so called inconsistencies between what the bible say's and what we " think " we know, but I err on the side of trusting God's explanation until He can tell me differently Himself some day. My only other option is to trust Man over God and that is the greatest lessen we learn from the Old Testament, that Israel so mistakenly did so often that destroyed their relationship with God and was defined as faithlessness by Him.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Please explain how you came to the conclusion that evolution and creation are complete opposites based on a non-literal interpretation of the bible. There is evidence of evolution, so I believe it happened. In my heart I believe God exists, so I believe he created the world. Is it really that farfetched to believe that the theories could exist in harmony, and in fact that evolution was a creation of God? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>If you are doing what many cultural christians do and accepting what is convenient about both belief systems and marrying them together so as to still be able to claim a type of intellectual spiritualism, then you are deluding yourself by compromising what the Creation story is with man made science, because the whole principle behind true evolution is that man evolved NATURALLY and SPONTANEOUSLY from organic matter billions of years ago. And from that humble beginning in the primordial ooze, all life formed from single celled bacteria or enzymes or whatever. But we weren't created by an intelligent being. So in order to accept evolution you must deny what the bible says about our creation by a loving and personal God. Unfortunately, that is the choice we have if we are to claim to believe in God. And God doesn't allow us to compromise.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I am not following my beliefs because it's convenient. I never said I believed in the whole evolution theory, either. I believe that the emergence of life is anything but spontaneous and random, which leads me to believe in a creator.

You are having a hard time accepting how geological evidence conflicts with Genesis so you attempt to accept both as rational beliefs. And I can respect you for that ; but don't compromise what the Torah tells you just for the sake of satisfying the man made science of secular humanists who have no real clue of Mans origins as they do everything they can to prove that we came into being naturally, apart from any participation of a loving and personal God by the name of Adonai, Jehovah and Yahweh.

Would it be a violation of the laws of physics, whatever that is, if I could think or believe myself into healing a disease or various medical condition?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The laws of physics don't preclude neural activity impacting physical reality, they require that it take place via a physical mechanism. eg positive thinking may improves serotonin levels and consequently white blood cell production, or some other mechanic. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>so what about the idea, though, that if I move into a new location and my subconscious mind generates a new physical trait to adapt me to the situation. In this way my mere thoughts ( non-physical ) would be creating a new physical body... aka, getting something from nothing -- pulling a rabbit out of a hat. ( I can show you numerous examples of this in the animal kindom if you wish. ) Also, what about non-locality. I could post some some weird stuff from physics... any of that count? I'm trying to pin down what is considered " miracle. " And why does God have to be involved in a " miracle " anyway?... what if I were to believe that since humans were created in the image of God that we are all capable ( or at least have the capacity ) of performing our own miracles? O, Ye of little faith -- Jesus<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Is it the " mind " that creates the change, or the electrochemical processes that accompany ( or are ) it? What you are doing is assuming when the physical mechanisms are unknown, things happen by magic. This seems like groundless superstition to me. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I don't know if they're " magic " or not -- no one will give me a defintion of magic. Is it the " mind " that creates the change, or the electrochemical processes that accompany ( or are ) it? something had to stimulate these specific electrochemical processes.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>And as far as we can tell, they're being stimulated by prior electrochemical processes, some internal, some external. Photon hits photoreceptor, chemical change takes place that sends an electrical signal, triggering a cascade of processes. As far as we can tell, at the level of electrical, chemical, motor activity of the body, there isn't any room for an independent mind. All the physical events taking place appear to have a prior physical cause. That's not to say there's no " mind ", its just a different level of explanation of the same thing. Just as a " crowd " is a different level of explanation for a group of people. A physical event without a prior physical cause - now that would be magic. Maybe the start of the universe, or maybe the behaviour of quantum particles works this way - then again maybe they don't, and we just don't understand the physics behind them, yet. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>interesting last statement.... and I think I would agree... not only that, but I think if thoughts / awareness indeed translate into new physiology, then " miracle " is the only explanation. Let's say, for example, that a white fish finds its way to a speckled background and then shortly after alters its color to speckled so it can blend in. How could this be anything but a miracle? There is nothing physical about being aware ( especially subconsciously ) of a particular background color.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Or is there? Awareness still takes place in the physical realm of electrochemical brain processes. I see no reason to believe spotted fish are any different in this regard. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>or is it the other way around ; is it that the electrochemical brain processes operate in the mental / conscious realm. It seems to me that the physcial must follow the lead of the mental.... if, for example, I ask you to picture a monkey standing on the back of an elephant, sure enough, the correct neurons will fire in your brain to make that happen... but you first made the conscious decision ( based on my suggestion ) to picture this. Your brain did not fire these neurons in advance of my question.... your physical electro-chemical activity, then, is the effect, not the cause. By you saying that no matter matter rules over the mind simply because all mind is within the body is flippantly dismissing thousands of years of debate...... Just because a physical body exists does not rule out that a non-physical mind is in control of it. It could be that the physical body is just the physical manifestation of the mind.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Ok, that seems intuitively reasonable to me too, but dualism of this variety has serious logical flaws. And this conscious decision takes place in.... different neurons. No, it fired different neurons in advance of my question. To really break it down we could talk about listening neurons, hearing neurons, consciousness neurons and visualisation neurons - that isn't really an accurate reflection of the complexities of brain structure, but it adequately illustrates the point that physical brain activity doesn't only start taking place at the post-decision level. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>but you first made the conscious decision ( based on my suggestion ) to picture this Actually, as I understand it, all the important stuff happens at the synapse... which is not really in the neuron at all. And until you can present me with a neuron or neurons that are responsible for picturing an elephant with a monkey standing on it, the idea that thoughts occur / originate within the confines of a neuron is merely speculation.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Clearly I didn't " decide " until after I " heard " and " understood " the question, and " felt " a certain way towards it, and any number of processes with neurological correlates took place, there's no gap in the process which requires the intervention of a mind creating action from nothing. I don't know where you heard that, but it's wrong. Such as the kind you'd encounter and extensively debate over the course of a 13 week philosophy of mind course, some of which can be found at the bottom of the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism...osophy_of_mind) article. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>SS : Actually, as I understand it, all the important stuff happens at the synapse... hmmm... really : HHMI Bulletin : The Synapse Revealed Virtually any cognitive task requires that the brain function on many different levels, from the individual molecules in cell membranes to far-flung neural circuits that encompass many cerebral regions. But at the center of the action is the " synapse "    the narrow cleft between neurons where one brain cell sends signals to another. This neural structure is essential to perception, behavior, memory, and thinking. " Without synapses, the brain would be just a collection of isolated neurons, " says New York University neuroscientist Joseph E. LeDoux, author of Synaptic Self : How Our Brains Become Who We Are. " Synapses are the gateway for information flowing into the brain, the means of communication within the brain, and the means by which behavior emerges from the brain.

So you are a creationist and an evolutionist. Strange combination Obviously you are not a scientist, neither psychology nor economics are science. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It is a common misconception, and one you apparently hold, that the purpose of studying evolution is to refute god. Whether the earth is 10,000 years old is irrelevant to whether evolution is true and / or useful to understand. I never claimed to be a scientist... Psychology is a broad discipline encompassing everything from computer modelling of cognitive theories, through neurobiology, which is simply biology, itself a subset of chemistry, itself a subset of physics, applied to the brain. In the context of this discussion, the relevant aspect of psychology is neurobiology, so whatever your half baked thoughts are on the rest of the discipline, they're entirely irrelevant to this thread. Thanks for your input.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Don    t put words in my mouth, I never said ( and you know it ) that the purpose of evolution is to disprove the existence of God. If you were a scientist, which evidently you are not ( and you admit it, thanks ) you would know that God ( or her negation ) is never part of any scientific theory. God is irrelevant to Science, the moment you introduce her into science it ceases to be science. Even people who are not scientists know that evolution of life on Earth has been taking place for billions of years so your    what if God created the world 10 000 years ago    is an    if    either originated by ignorance or sarcasm. Everything is a subset of something but it doesn    t mean that because of that reductionism you can use Quantum mechanics and string theory to explain the mind. You are so good at sending people to learn about this or that, it would be great if you would follow your own advice for once for it when it comes half baked mumbo jumbo you are numero uno <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Then of course you realise that there's no conflict between evolution and special creation... Actually it means exactly that. The laws of physics don't break down inside the brain. We choose to operate at a higher level of abstraction because the quantum level is simply too detailed for our purposes, we don't want to know about what happens to every quark, we want to know what happens at the level of the cell, neuron or brain region. I wouldn't have to if you bothered to do some research before opening your mouth. Making pointless and ignorant blanket statements like " psychology isn't a science " marks you as someone with who intelligent discussion is impossible. I completely understand if you hold a philosophical stance contra mainstream psychology, a la Tom Cruise, but you don't even have Tom Cruise's level of thought put into what you say, it's just something you heard and repeated without bothering to think about it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>how do you know I never I thought about it and repeated it without bother to think about it? look, I don't care for your insults.

Chao, the thread is yours. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Then why come out with #### like " why bother about evolution then? according to the Genesis it took her less than a week to create the world as it is now. " Because if you bothered to think about it, you'd realise that the controversies around psychology as a science have nothing to do with neurobiology. If you bothered to think about it, you'd be able to explain your view without resorting to cutting and pasting the first thing that comes up when you google psychology not science - Google Search Well you thought wrong, if that were the case there'd be no Chemists, only Physicists. That's not my occupation, no.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>because you said what if the world was created as per the Bible and then evolved in 10 thousands years. the world was created complete, totally evolved according to the Bible so evolution was unneeded. it was you who came up with that absurd ' if ' not me. of course not, psychology, as that link shows, does not qualify as science. by the way you are always sending people to links, obviously you are unable to explain your views without resorting to it, but you don't like it when it is done to you. chemists work at the necessary level But it is what you got a degree in, right?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7011_159_158__160_164_166_176_178_181_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>...

It just confirms that, being personal, it's all purely in your imagination, and you're afraid to face reality.

It is a typical debating method to minimize ones opponant in order to weaken the strength of their stance but nobody is dumb enough to believe that I am the only believer there is, so you just succeeded in minimizing your own credibility.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>OK, Archie, what don't you understand by the terms : Your God. No-one else's. The fact that millions world-wide seek solace and an emotional crutch in an imagined deity of their own making ( however common the foundation ) only strengthens my argument. There is nothing to suggest that any of your experiences are other than anecdotal, being totally unverifiable or testable. a. nobody said or even hinted that you were the only believer there is. You persistently air your own viewpoint as the only valid one because your God is your personal God. ; b. your quote above is an exceptionally transparent strawman. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Sorry, but that statement clearly implies that God is a personal God to me alone and nobody else. If that isn't what you meant to say then learn how to communicate more clearly. You insult me and all believer again charlie, and you deceive yourself further by assuming that our submission to a Holy God is an emotional crutch in an imagined deity. And again with the testable and verifiable requirements as if you can find the God who created everything in a test tube. How sad and wanting I find you to be charlie. A true empty vessel. Oh really? I'm exaggerating what you said? Here is your quote, read it for yourself and tell me how I should have interpreted this.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I'll ask again, Archie, what don't you understand by the term personal God? Do you know what the term personal actually means? A personal God is personal to you, nobody else. Millions of people have their own personal God. But it's personal to them. That's why you chose to use the term personal. So once again you are playing at being obtuse and introducing strawmen into what could be an interesting debate, but being made nonsensical by you and your unproven aberrations. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I see what you are implying charlie. God is " A " personal God, not " MY " personal God. But you already knew and understood very well that is what I said in my description of our relationship. But you have wasted this bandwidth arguing this non issue. And you claim I am introducing a strawman? You waste my time with meaningless minutia and then claim to seek an interesting debate. Can you comprehend the word hypocrite?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>( My bold above. ) I can certainly comprehend the word hypocrite. Here's a definition : Sums you up perfectly, Arch. Anyway, I digress. How do you differentiate between a personal God, and my personal God? Here's a small selection from your recent posts referencing a personal God. Who's is this personal God, if not yours? You're so keen to spout about your personal relationship with God, a relationship you can't demonstrate beyond the fanciful and anecdotal, a relationship which seems to give you the right to be arrogant, conceited, haughty and condescending to those who seek to challenge your assertions. I'll say it again, Arch, no-one here doubts that what you think happened to you is anything but your own interpretation. No-one denies that you firmly believe that. But what you keep refusing to answer is WHY we should believe you. How does your experience benefit us? How do your anecdotes prove that God and angels exist? Fanciful imaginings are not proof of anything and don't leave room for any sort of manoeuvre in trying to debate the issue. If you don't want to debate fanciful imaginings or subject yourself to intellectual criticism on a debating forum, why bring it up?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7237_70_62__73_76_82_101_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You should acknowledge that there are different opinions on what a " fact " is.

We do find this statement there ; I believe that's true, and I'm sure many scientists don't. So there you have it, who is right? Could it be that many scientists believe it's possible to add a fact and a theory, and come up with a fact for the sum of the two? Or might they think that multiple additions, such as five facts + one theory equals a fact? Or maybe one fact + one theory + one hypothesis + one guess + one lick + one promise all equal a fact as long as it supports atheism? Actual facts are pretty hard to come by IMO. They should be so clear that they shouldn't be disputed. I even believe it's possible to add two facts and not always get a fact for the sum. The slightest bit of human desire or emotion changes it from a fact to a theory. To not acknowledge that science does this for political reasons all the time could be a VERY self destructive act, considering its eternal consequences.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Pot, meet kettle, you're black.

We do find this statement there ; Which is amusing as you use the products of those so called non-facts every day. How is it that you can reject the science which brings you great products? Geology is wrong but gasoline is real? What kind of asinine logic is that? So me getting angry makes gravity not true? I see you haven't changed at bit. You don't win many discussions do you? Exactly. Hence why politics needs to get out of science and why Bush should have never started his bullying of sciences to get what he wanted. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>There is a difference between present products and pre-historic proclamations.

Did you say something about pots and kettles?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Yes, but when the sciences that comes to the conclusion about the past that uses those conclusions to produce products that you use, the difference is rather minute. Creationists live a life of outright lies. They deny that evolution is true yet freely embrace the products of the sciences that say evolution is true. Evolution is wrong but geology which uses much of the same methods to estimate and find fossils and fossil fuels is true. Oh wait. Contradiction, but we're creationists, let's just pretend it still makes sense. All of the time. Your pasts post here haven't been kind to your reputation. And please answer the question about since when did religion and God for that matter only include Abrahamic beliefs. Merely stating the truth about your arguments is not bullying. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Name some of the products we wouldn't have without evolution. I'd like to check on how they actually originated.

Atheist : Anyone who disagrees with Mar c9000 extremely narrow point of researchless views. This is English. Not make up your own definitions language. Other religions have no problems with evolution. You are therefore, as always, wrong. How can evolution be atheistic when religions accept it? You never answered this question and always flee like a coward when addressed it. And atheists reject the notion of God. Evolution doesn't even discuss it. How can it be atheist when it neither rejects or accepts a deity? Evolution is far more accurately described as agnostic, not atheistic.

Maybe your definition are in a sense better but many people adopt the position that when someone defines things you intercept them using their definitions AND THEIR DEFINITIONS ALONE. You do not seem to think this should be done. This is the main reason why people treat you the way they do. It actually has little to do with them practicing objectivism or scientism.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Is this the reason you have four times called me a liar, and offered no proof?

Since a statement cannot be verified and unveirfied at the same time, it cannot be a hypothesis and a conclusion at the same time. The same statement that started as the hypothesis can end up being the conclusion, but at that time it is no longer a hypothesis. People purporting to be scientists present conclusions beased on incomplete testing and by not following the scientific method all the time. In a captialist system, especially in america, what is accepted as backed by science has more to do with what the media promotes as true than what has been actually verified by the scientific method. Regardless of how much another scientists refutes the claim based on real science, it is the acceptance by the public that allow multi-million dollar corporations to commit fraud and get away with it. And because they can control what the media says through money, they can financially benefit through the manipulation of the public to accept their claims.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>A conclusion is not a tested verified hypothesis, it is merely the statement whose truth value is claimed to be dependent on supporting statements in an argument. You're telling me, AGCC irrational evolution, absurd diets, everything causes cancer. This is a cultural problem, people think science is an authority that must be blindly accepted. Corporations control the media? rofl. The media controls the media, and they are left wing lunatics who would rather cut the throat of a successful corporation than lie for them. They have their own agendas and when companies spring up to take advantage of the falsehoods they spread do not confuse cause and effect. Yet you still have made no progress towards explaining why a financially motivated scientist can't practice science. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I never said a financially motivated scientist can't practice science. I said a scientific conclusion cannot be derived because of financial motivation. You cannot pay a scientist to come up with a conclusion that scientific testing can't verify.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You said : You have changed the claimed relationship. Now you are claiming that financial motivation cannot make non-science science. This is obvious. Before you were claiming that financial motivation could make science non-science, you have not supported this. In the above quote you do not mention anything about the conclusion except that it was the source of financial motivation. Since you did not include any other conditions your statement must apply to cases in which the scientific method is followed as well as those in which it is not. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>What? Financial motivation cannot make an unverified conclusion into a scientifically verified conclusion. That's what I've been saying all along, in both instances that you quote me. I never said otherwise, neither do I need to support a claim I never made. Now I have no idea where the disagreement even is, because you've confused what I've said, along with interjecting your own ideas of what I've implied, that I don't even know what the point of the dabate is anymore.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>In this statement the subject is the scientist : Let us take it one step at a time. Scientist A is hired by a company to research subject B. They tell him he will only be paid if he reaches conclusion 1. Using the scientific method, and repeatable and conclusive experiment he arrives at conclusion 1. Your statement applies to this scenario because it is a scientist who is motivated by financial gain to arrive at a particular conclusion. Why is it not science? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The scientist arrived at conclusion 1 because he followed the scientific method and it verified that conclusion 1 is supported by the research. He did not reach the conclusion because he was paid to. The presence of money or any other reward is irrelevant to the evidence supporting the conclusion. You cannot pay a scientist any sum of money to arrive at a scientific conclusion that science in itself cannot support. Any such occurence is unscientific. Which is what I've been saying from the onset.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You are modifying your statement, which did not contain a causal condition but merely a condition. Not : I agree, which is why I said that if a scientist is reports a particular conclusion because it will give him financial gain, then its not science. Neither pure nor true nor any other type. Even that would not be sufficient, because it could be argued that he followed the scientific method because he was paid to ; and thus financial motivation is still in the causal chain. You would have to say : I agree, which is why I said that if a scientist is reports a particular conclusion only because it will give him financial gain, then its not science. Neither pure nor true nor any other type. All hypotheses are the conclusions of the experiments which will support them. Note in Winston's example the money is returned if the tests fails, thus the money was not offered for mere testing, but for a particular result. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>In other words, you disagree with what I said, then rewrite what I said, then agreed with it. Fair enough. Agreed. However, you cannot know whether the test will support the hypothesis until the test is run, at which time it becomes a conclusion. These semantics games are boring. No disagreement here either. You said that 2 of the 4 scenarios Winston mentioned entailed real science ( patting yourself on the back ), when Winston just reiterated the point that if the scientist came to the conclusion that the company wanted him to because they were paying him to do so, then that's not science, which is what we have all been saying from the beginning.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Problem is you didn't say it, what you did say was incorrect and not what you switched to. The conclusion refers to the statements relationship in logical expression, it's label is not dependent on the truth of the premises or even the quality of the logic. So no, it is a conclusion before and after. You said more than that, you said that those two scenarios weren't scientist either.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-4061_132_129__134_136_146_148_150_153_5<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Isn't that the exact definition of why people have belief in evolution. Your funny. :p ( ie. We don't know how it was done, but it happened, so even though we can't actually prove it, we must be right. So much for that theory. Don't you see that is exactly what this debate is about! Neither side can prove a. evolution or b. a creator 100% That is why my argument is : what is a more plausable explanation for the origin of life.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You've been playing fast and loose with this terminology, and it really has to stop. Evolution is the study of how populations change over time. The theory of evolution has been conclusively proven to be true. Abiogenesis is the study of how life started on this planet. There are no theories yes, just hypothesis. We know evolution is true. We know life started somehow, and we're trying to figure out the details. If you want to talk about how populations change, use the term evolution. If you want to talk about the process by which life started, call it by it's proper term, abiogenesis. Otherwise you're just adding another layer of confusion to the discussion. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I was referring to evolution. You think it is fact and I don't think it is fact. In your own words and what I was laughing at : still hilarious. closer to a fact does not make a fact. What don't you get about that? I think I've already asked you that. Don't you see? Listen to what trebor said : But hey, you think evolution is a fact, er I mean almost a fact ( )? I have tried to keep this to one argument, but with the billions and billions of species in the world, you should be able to show me at least many many, but for now if you can show me just one scenario where the links take us from one species completely to another, I'd be happy to look at it and comment.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Sigh. We, and by we I mean anyone who knows anything about the science of evolution, understand that the theory of evolution is 99.999% likely to be correct. The. 001% basically is to allow for something utterly bizzare to appear out of nowhere and discount it. Based on that I'd call evolution a fact. What would you call it? We have the fossil record that goes from modern horses back to something that resembles a dog. Multiple examples are spelled out in the book " The Beak of the Finch ". We have genetically determined that the whale's closest land based relative is the hippo. And of course people have taken boars and turned them into pigs, wolves into dogs, and wild fowl into chickens. These are just the easy ones. There are literally millions of examples in the literature. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>LOL. Isn't that a little like me saying God exists because creationists say so? If there are so many examples in literture, please point me in the right direction. I'm not really interested in micro evolution. We all know that that is a fact. So, no whales growing legs. What I want to see is just ONE example of one species turning into another. No matter how many times you say it is so, it doesn't make it so. You need to start backing up your assertation.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Of course not. Scientists base their statements on observable facts and reasoning, which you can check up on. There's nothing similar backing up creationists claims. I just gave you several. Do you literally mean that you only want one? Fine. We have a fossil record showing a dog sized animal changing over time into the modern horse. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>No, no, lol. Again, please provide the proof. I keep getting knocked because I'm not providing proof of a creator ( when all I'm actually trying to do is prove that a creator is a plausable theory ) You need to be able to back up your claims with a reputuable source. If this is true, there should be any of number of websites and books dedicated to it. Please advise where to find this information.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Seriously? I though this was common knowledge. Ok, here's a site with good photos of the fossils, showing the change over the course of 55 million years. http://chem.tufts.edu/science/evolut...eEvolution.htm If you don't think that this constitutes proof then please spell out, as exactly as you can, where you think the holes are. I have no idea what your educational background is, but there are clearly things that I think are common knowledge that you haven't heard, so I really don't know how much detail you need to be able to follow this. BTW, since you keep claiming that your discussion isn't about evolution at all, I'll have no objections to your dropping this thread, if it'll give you the time to state what you position actually is on ID. If you have stated when and how this design was supposed to have happened I must have missed it.

Even if all your critizisms were true ( which they are not ), nothing you have done has attempted to answer that question. That is what your original claim that you were going to do was. When are you going to address that subject? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I did, but you conveniently ignore what I say that you can't answer. You can't get to B if you don't first have A. See? I said that this was a debate of science vs. science. And before my original intended argument turns into evolution, which is irrelevant, I really would like to get back to this. I expected you to at least move on to self ordering tendencies w / my argument against amino acids and protiens being able to organize themselves, but you haven't. Why haven't we gotten into the guts of what a cell is really comprised of and why do you refuse to discuss this self organization? I suggest that is because you know you must take a great leap of faith. Your very refusal to discuss these things is evidence that we should at least consider intelligent design.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Let's see.. We gave you lots of answers. You reject it. YOu insist on more information, you move the goal posts. You have not discuess ' ID ' at all when it comes to the origin of life. I suggest you aren't discussing ID because you have nothing to say about it. I suggest you reject the information provided, because it threatens you. I suggest that it doesn't matter, because at the essence of your claim is that ' An intelligent designer is more logical than natural process as the origin of life ' " makes the knowledge, ( or lack there of ) irrelavent. You made a claim for the logic, you fail to address that issue.. Untill you act with a little more honesty, I am not going to sucked into your lies.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-584_4_1__7_9_11_12_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Here are some embarrassments that evolutionaries have had to gloss-over... Archaeoraptor http://www.dinohunters.com/History/Microraptor.htm<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Mont, I grow weary of dealing with this creationist strawman about the way in which Archaeoraptor was received by the scientific community, and subsequent rejection of the taxon as invalid. I will explain the situation to you one last time. " Archaeoraptor liaoningensis " was presented without formal description in peer reviewed literature as a nomen nudum, in a 1999 National Geographic article. The article was mainly a photo-shoot, and explicity denied being a rigorous treatment following the protocol of the ICZN. It was during this nebulous period that the paleontological community, upon further review, demonstrated that " Archaeoraptor " was a chimera, and therefore the taxon was invalid. Note that not only had the scientific community left the taxon as a nomen nudum, but furthermore, the very evolutionary biologists supposedly promulgating " Archaeoraptor " as sine qua non proof of theropod origin, and NOT creationists, who exposed " Archaeoraptor " as a nomen dubium. Therefore, the entire creationist strawman account of the history of this specimen, so zealously parroted by the likes of Jonathan Sarfati and AIG is quite simply the most specious of distortions. Only in creationist spew, has " Archaeoraptor " ever been so euphorically treated as is claimed. Vindex Urvogel <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Then, don't deal with it. Isn't that simple. There is a lot of arrogance displayed from posters on your side... " I've already dealt with this argument " " I've grown tired of debating this " " You are bothering me " It is rather too centred on self. I am not writing these things directly to annoy YOU or take up YOUR time I'm sorry that YOU would think that my whole reason for arguing is to convince YOU particulary. Sorry, but I don't even know YOU... so if YOU are being bothered, don't read my posts which are quite clearly marked as being authored by " MONTALBAN "... just skip past them. ( This is of course the product of a godless society that allows the individual to be the supreme arbiter of good and evil ; the ultimate authority in the world - self-centred world )<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Not at all, mont. You presented a deliberate lie about the reception and treatment of " Archaeoraptor " on the part of the scientific community. I called you on the distortion by detailing the ' actual ' facts of the " Archaeoraptor " issue ( which makes your assertion that I simply ignored the issue and do not deal with it supremely amusing ). Either retract the claim, or substantiate it, and keep your preaching about godless society and ad hominems borne from refusal to present anything ' but ' strawmen, out of the thread -- as they have no business here. Vindex Urvogel <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Eh? On another thread I think I said quite clearly that it was a fake. I also said I didn't know who presented it as fake... it may have been you that said scientists followed it up, and I accepted this explanation. But, it remains evidence of frauds and fakes, which I am quite happy to include in a list of frauds and fakes. And the people who presented it were evolutionaries, so it is still a valid point to list it here. Even here I said " Of course, some writers will be at pains to point out that evolutionaries un-covered these frauds. " So your argument is that if an evolutionary presents a fake, and it is found out to be a fake by another evolutionary, they cancel each other out, and should never be heard of again? And, you are starting to get agressive. Am I forcing you to read my posts? Perhaps again this is further proof of the arrogance of posters on your side. What happened to ' free speech '?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You presented the case of Archaeoraptor in a long list of other cases which you have claimed were engineered by overzealous scientists seeking to promulgate evolution at the expense of reality. " Archaeoraptor " was a debacle only to the National Geographic, it was never a significant issue to the scientific community, which is accustomed to a nomen nudum turning into a nomen dubium all the time -- it is indeed quite common in paleontology. I furthermore would call to your attention that in a moderated forum, " free speech " is in fact restricted. Individuals using a moderated forum which is based on certain protocols, are not free to say anything they wish.

Kinda hard, since I'm male.

If anyone else doesn't ask for forgiveness they go to hell. Comprendes? When the female you reproduce with has children without tonsils, let me know. How was I supposed to know that you were male? " Crim " doesn't sound like a gender specific screen name to me. Calligirl, on the other hand, is kinda obvious. Source please? Sorry but the link won't work. ( I'm not kidding, it won't work. ) Not if it's a mutation or an acquired trait. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Any of the CBN shows like the 700 Club. Plenty of channels on Sunday mornings. And why should shows be giving god credit for anything? You said all homosexuals were going to hell. Your reason was because homosexual acts were sins. I pointed out that all people sin. Do a google search on the CCR-5 gene mutation. Try this : http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/speciation.html Why wouldn't it?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Oh yeah, like the televangelist shows. :) Come on, get real. Maybe they should give God credit for things because He is omnipotent and omnipresent. Maybe because He created us to love Him and serve Him. Maybe because He has blessed America in so many ways! They go to hell because they do not ask for forgiveness from their sins. Anyone who asks for forgiveness and changes will not go to hell. They do not want to change their sinful ways. ( How many times to I have to repeat myself? ) I'm lazy and debating 3 other people. Why don't you do it for me? I tried the link and it took me to http://www.weeeeeeee.com/ ( I think my computer is having problems. :) ) Ever heard of the " mouse experiment "? This freak scientist cut off the tails of mice and then bred them together. The offspring had normal size tails. He tried this millions ( exagerating ) of times with the same results. Acquired traits cannot be passed down from generation to generation. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You asked for one. I supplied it. If you'd like to present an example of a show being explicitely atheist, please do so. I see no reason why secular shows should be required to mention your mythology. And HOW do you know that homosexuals don't repent? Because I don't feel like copying and pasting articles into a forum when they can be easily accessed online. But for a quick summary : The CCR-5 gene mutation is present in about 15% of caucasians, with 1% having the homogeneous version. These 1% are completely immune. The heterogeneous people possess some immunity. Do a google search for ' observed speciation events '. Those links should be the first two results. That's basically the dumbest experiment I've ever heard. Cutting off a mouse's tail wouldn't affect its DNA, so the offspring would still have tails.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Animal Planet, Discovery Chanel, NOVA, etc. I just gave you three. If they had repented, they wouldn't be homosexuals any longer. Crim : I'm going to have to reply to your other statements later. Gotta go! <br><b>S1:4-  </b>They're explicitely atheist? Wow, I didn't realize those channels had a lot of shows about " hey, there's no god ". Read what I said again. Why not?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Oops, sorry! I was thinking about it and realized that they aren't atheist, they are humanist. ( Or at least they try to be. ) I didn't see the word " secular ". But if they are humanist ( which they try to be ), shouldn't they mention every " god "? I never heard them mentioning God using evolution as a possibility for the existence of man. Because they would not be performing homosexual acts any longer. homosexual : of, relating to, or characterized by a tendency to direct sexual desire toward another of the same sex God takes away wrongful desires. Therefore, someone who was previously " homosexual " would not be considered " homosexual " anymore. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>They're not humanist, they're scientific. So you've never repeated a sin?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Yes, God does take away sinful desires. ( If you ask Him. ) I'm not saying that it doesn't take any work on your part, though. When you have a sinful desire, you allow a thought to become more than just a stray idea. You foster and encourage the thought and it becomes a desire. God takes away the desires, helps you deal with your " stray thoughts ", and shows you how to keep them from becoming desires. That all depends on what your definition of science is. ( Different debate. ) Let's put it this way, if they " repeat their sin " but honestly ask Christ to forgive them and to help them not to repeat it, then they are not " homosexual ". If you are constantly having sex with the same sex and then asking for forgiveness, you are not a true Christian. You are trying to tell me that the desire for the opposite sex is some kind of " accident ". " Well, what if they didn't mean to have sex... " That doesn't work, you have to be truly sorry and then MAKE AN EFFORT to stop. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I disagree.

What provided the hypoxic environment and the minerals for the entire height of the standing, unrotted tree?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I'm not aware of an entire tree being fossilized. Usually, it's just a portion of the trunk. It's going on in a reservoir near me, as muck accumulates over trees submerged when a dam produced a lake. In the right conditions, the environment is hypoxic, and not much rotting takes place. If it's not disturbed for a long time, we get petrified trees, usually polystrate, because the process goes on for several periods of time. Say a grove of trees is flooded by some kind of lake-forming event ( landlslide say ) and then over a number of decades, several floods deposit layers of sediment. Eventually, the land changes, dries, and the muck compacts to rock. Standing polystrate tree fossils result. Not very common, but they do exist. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I have heard that explanation b4 and the trouble is that the root balls could not have formed and fossilized at the same level as their neighbors ' stems. If a mudslide came into your area and buried the trunk upto 12 ' you could not expect a root ball to form in the 4 - 10 foot level above original grade. [ That assumes the original trees survived the mudslide and continued to mineralized. ]<br><b> S2:2-  </b>They didn't start the process at the same time. That's why they are polystrate. Sure you could. In fact that can be seen happening. At Mt. St. Helens, many trees near the lake were partially or fully buried. Later, trees grew on the new ground, with root balls higher then trees buried in the first level. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The root ball would start at the same level where the top of its neighbor rotted off. The most you could expect for overlap is the depth of the stump from the crown down. Speaking of Mt. St. Helens, what is the status of those trees in Spirit Lake?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Spirit lake does not now exist there. Many of the trees are deeply buried, some still sticking out of the ash, and others completely covered. As new trees take hold, they grow down into the ash, and overlap with the old trees. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>It will be fun to see how long it takes those things to fossilize. Seems like that was ideal conditions for the process. Interesting article about sand dune fossilization of those crustaceans. Is there a way to tell the difference, between wet and dry fossilization? Has it ever been done in a lab or observed in another setting? This last line makes me wonder if they were saying these things were fossilized in the sand dune but was under the sea for a while : " This could be due to a fall in sea level associated with glacial eustasy in the last ice age. ( author abst. ) " What do you make of it?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>In artificial circumstances, it can move pretty quickly. But it doesn't give you as much detail as more gradual fossilizations. Somewhat. The shape of the grains of sand, for example, are different in wind-blown and water-moved cross-bedding formations. No one's had a few million years of lab time, yet. Even in dunes, there's some water. But normally, the dunes get compacted and then cemented. Over time, there's a very slow migration of mineral particles from one to another, and as these harden, the sand gets cemented together.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-761_45_44__47_49_50_51_53_56_58_61_64_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It dictates, but it doesn't actual prove that you have a so-called soul.

Therefore saying that belief is incorrect because it doesn't fit the facts is just as incorrect. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Hardly. Believing that the Earth is flat and the sun goes around it doesn't make it so. Beliefs based on facts and reality are far more valid than those based on nothing more than wishful thinking.

We can show that a mind exists. Everything that exists can be measured in one way or another. Energy is energy.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Don't be Montying around. What makes you think everything that exist has energy? Maybe just everything we know about has energy. Okay well I'm open, prove there is no soul. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Even the so-called immaterial has an energy signature. First, prove that we do have a soul. Don't act like a theist and try to shift the burden of proof.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Okay show me how you know that everything that is not material has an energy signature. I am a theist, why shouldn't I act like one? But you were the one that said Deeph's belief about humans having a soul was incorrect and that you were basing yours on facts. You made the assertion that you had the facts and I'm asking you to back it up with the facts you mentioned. Deeph admited that it can't be proved, you are implying that it can. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Energy is " immaterial ". Stick your finger in a live socket and find out. :) In that caes you are acting like one and thus are trying to shift the burden of proof. In all of this time no one has ever found the so-called soul, and it wasn't from a lack of trying either. Along the way were have learned much of the body and mind instead, but still no soul. Say that you had your mind recorded and one day you are killed and they grow you are new body, and then download your mind into it. Would you still have a soul? If they made other copies would they to have your soul?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I was under the understanding that Einstein proved that energy was just another form of matter. No I was requesting proof of your statement, not shifting any burden of proof. Deeph had already stated he had no proof. You stated that you had the facts. Well no one has ever found the explanation for biogenesis either although it    s not from a lack of trying. Does that mean it never happened? There are lots of things that man finds every century. How does not finding something prove there is not that something? Besides how do you find something that is supernatural with natural means? I never said the soul was tied to the mind. Different people have different beliefs about a soul or lack of. I happen to believe that it is a part of God in us. I don    t know how it    works    and is therefore a mystery to me. But I still believe it. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Didn't say that it wasn't. Engergy and matter are basically the same thing. All have an energy signature of somekind and can be measured. You're the one who is making an extra-ordinary claim. The existence of a soul. How is unknown, but it is easy enough to see the results. Where do I look to see a soul? They've been looking for centuries, even thousands of years and nothing. Prove that the supernatural exists in the first place. All that exists is part of nature. You think that nature is only to do with the wild. Nature : 2. A causal agent creating and controlling things in the universe If you believe in the supernatural than you must also believe in everything said to be supernatural since by your definition you can't disprove, or prove it. So ghosts, werewolves, vampires, and other supernatural things that go bump in the night must exist as well.

I understand where you're coming from, I just don't see it that way. Like you said, the purpose of science is to explain mysteries. Evolution is one of those mysteries and there are religious Scientists who have done great work in the field. But for me the real mystery is the Origin of Life. As long as religion stands in the way I personally don't believe we will ever really know, we may not either way. A religious person may now believe in evolution, and they may even speak out against Creationism, but they still believe there is an imaginary being in the sky watching over us as we move through life. Many of those same " Scientists " when asked where they came from will still say " GOD "... So they are not really scientists in my opinion. And then there is the faction that have jumped on board with Evolution so they can mix with the reality of the world. I think that they honestly believe this will help them one day push " God " back into our schools. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>well, a scientist shouldnt be accredited as a scientist based on his / her beliefs that have nothing to do with their work, no? they cant substantiate God, and since science requires substantiation, their belief in God is unscientific, and therefore they believe in something that is unscientific, which is not very scientific of them, yes, and thats where i see the hypocricy in their beliefs. but their beliefs apart from science dont affect their scientific credentials. would you call a believer in God with a Ph. D in biology from Harvard, now a professor of biology at Harvard not really a scientist? i wouldnt.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I wouldn't either, but I would question his ability to think rationally. So what you're saying is that in order to do his Job he would have to think like a scientist while at work, but when he gets off work he can " Dumb " himself down a bit to go back to irrational thought?.. I just don't see how Science and religion can exist in one mind. They are complete opposites. but that's my opinion, I will admit I am a bit Biased because of my feelings about organized religion.... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>now that, we can agree on. however, you have to think, when were talking about science vs religion, we arent talking about every religious person, were talking about those religious people who attack science and try to resort the world to religious dogma. a person who is religious but doesnt attack science in any way - may even be pro-science - is not affecting the situation at all. we're after the fundies. whether youre against religion as a whole, which i certainly am as well, is a different matter.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You mean there are religious people who Don't attack Science?....

I do believe scientists are sincere in their search for knowledge, but there is so much in the effort of finding things just to try to deny God. Yes, there are many people thrown out of their positions or denied tenure if they teach I.D. (. ) I encourage you to watch the movie " Expelled " that Ben Stein made, even if it is only to see the people who have been fired for their beliefs.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That's an idiotic assertion. How can a search for knowledge be an effort to deny your petty god? What would be the purpose of searching for knowledge that denies your petty god? Ben Stein lied to you. Those people in Stein's movie weren't fired because of their beliefs. They were fired because they refused to do the job that they were hired to do, or they were incompetent. Take for example, William Dembski, who was let go by Baylor University ( a Baptist affiliated university ) because he didn't do what he was hired to do. I notice that you don't support your assertion with examples. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>This is the kind of person I was talking about. ( Thanks for proving my point Data ). I know what you mean, my parents told me Harry Potter was evil because of the witchcraft, then my dad saw one of the movies and loved it so much we own all of them and we read all the books. But as Data has shown, there are those who use " science " so they can deny God. Most of the science that does this is unbased while most other facets of science show His glory even without mentioning Him. They were hired to teach a class, not to teach evolution.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Apparently you didn't notice that he didn't say that he was searching for ways to deny your god. He said that he took pleasure when the results debunked the wholly babble and creationism. Again, that's not what he said. Personally, when I was doing science there never was any intent to deny your petty god. However, it was always funny when creationists squealed at the results of science. What a load of nonsense. So science can show the glory of a mythical being without mentioning him, and it can also debunk the existence of that mythical being, also without mentioning him. You're so logical. And they were fired for not teaching that class. I personally know of an English teacher who taught creationism in his English classes. He was let go. Of course, only an XXXXX would try to teach that the earth is only 6,000 years old in a earth science class. It takes intentional ignorance to deny evolution. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The only thing is that they don't debunk creationism. So to take pleasure in something that looks like it might, is to have been searching for it in the first place. I just don't like " theories " that are mere speculation to be taken and taught as fact. No, I meant without a base. It takes ignorance to deny something that has no proof?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Now you're just trying to be funny. Yep. You're just trying to be funny. Thank god that scientific theories are not just mere speculation. Ever hear of the theory of gravity? I know. You're going to display your profound ignorance of scientific topics by telling us that " gravity is a law. " Wrong again. Newton formulated the first theory of gravity that was based on a consistant observation. The observation is the law and the theory explains why. Same with evolution. The theories are explanations of observations of evolution. On the other hand, there are no observations or explanations of " creation. " Just immaginings based on the mythology of nomadic, bronze age herdsmen. Then, by saying " unbased " you actually meant to talk gibberish. In fact, the theories of evolution are based on observations of changes the genetic makeup of populations of living things. You display yet more ignorance of what science is and how it works. Of course, there isn't even a hint of evidence of creationism. It's pretty silly to fall back on magic for anything that you don't understand. To believe in young earth creationism means that one must deny physics, geology, astrophysics, astronomy, biology - in fact, all of science but elementry chemistry. Wow!

You are probably having trouble using words precisely and have mistake two similar statements for two identical statements. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>sigh. Darwin's name is used by ID advocates as an attack on evolution, never to support their own " theory ". you have to think a bit harder before answering and throwing up strawmen. like i said, IC is used by ID advocates, and to satisfy your endless crave for absolute straight answers without the need for implications that seeminly anyone apart from you can catch up on, ID advocates use IC to support their idea. you cant escape what's true. ID advocates use IC as their main argument in support of their " theory ". observe any ID advocate and youll hear " ____ is so complex, it couldnt have evolved through a gradual process. " i cant believe im having to catch you up on this... despite the fact that Behe is an advocate of intelligent design... and he came up with IC to support ID. well done, freedie. you seem flustered, freedom. are you flustered?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10106_255_253__257_258_259_260_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No ' this all ' is because some people would rather play the part of foolish partisan rather than admit the simplest thing. In case you forgot, ' this all ' started when it was claimed that I must be a creationist because espouse IC. ' this all ' is about whether or not that is the case. The only way that could be the case is if IC forced via logic any who accept it to the conclusion of creationism. Which means the crucial premise that will decide ' all this ' is whether or not one can support ID with IC. and my claim was that it cannot be. lol<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So what you're saying is that Behe, as well as all the others who use IC to support ID got it wrong?.. I found this interesting.. Even the Courts disagree with you.. lol.. Note the part where he says that IC is CENTRAL to ID... Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District I personally don't know, I don't care... the Term IC refers to Creationism whether it can proven or not, the leading ID'ers consistently try to use IC to support their position. If you disagree I suggest you take it up with the ones who came up with the term to begin with. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I can't help but giggle because no matter how many times I say the same thing it never sinks in. IDrs think that defeating evolution supports ID. They got that wrong. IDrs and ICers think that IC defeats evolution. They got that right. However ; no sane person claims to go from IC to ID directly, they would have to be tottally ignorant of what IC is. Be it a single feverish fool in a funny farm or the whole world crying against it, logic has no equal. Ah the death knell of all arguments ' it is so whether it can be proven or not '. I would be taking it up with ken millar and dawkins too if they were members of political debate forums. Regardless the burden of proof still lies with the affirmative position. I have not held you to greater than that ' you cannot argue for IC without supporting ID ' = > ' IC supports ID ' = > ' IC can support ID '. What are you talking about?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>First of all why not call them what they are.. ID'ers = Creationists. Anything a Creationist finds that can defeat evolution he / she will claim that it supports their belief. You say that IC defeats Evolution and that they got that right, So that means if Evolution is not possible then Creation is the only other explanation for life. Which in turn means that If IC can defeat Evolution then it MUST support Intelligent design. Intelligent Design = Creation, you can't really believe there is any difference. So if you believe in your own mind that IC defeats Evolution, as you imply in the above quote, then IC does in fact support ID.. which is Really just another way to say Creation. So are you a creationist or an Evolutionist? you can spin it however you like but you can only be one or the other, there is no in between. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>All creationist are IDrs but not all IDrs are creationist. I know. Really, how do you propose to support that dichotomy? Why? The choice between two wrongs should not be made.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are Wrong, Intelligent Design implies a creator, whether that be some alien being or a supernatural invisible man it implies a Creator. Creationists came up with the term intelligent design in an attempt to introduce creation into the realm of science so they could in effect teach " Creation " in schools. You can make your claim until you're blue but it doesn't change reality. I don't have to. When discussing the subject of Life and how it exists we are left with two options. We either evolved as evolutionists believe or we were created by some higher being. Play your little word games if you want, it doesn't change this fact either. You're either a Creationist or an Evolutionist, there is no in between. So you are saying that both Evolution and Creation are wrong? I would love to hear your explanation of Life without involving either a creator or Evolution.. And before you go trying to use IC as a stand alone explanation for life don't bother. Anyone with half a brain knows that IC is not a stand alone explanation. you're just being ridiculous and twisting words to fit your position, but the facts are obvious.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7755_12_11__13_14_15_16_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Well, I was just giving a different perspective from a witness who was also there, so obviously not everyone sees the events the same way. The thing is though, if they were booting people for being biased against the movie, or because they would object to it's message, it stands to reason they wouldn't have let anyone in PZ Myer's party in as well. And do you seriously think that if Richard Dawkins ' name was registered on the website they wouldn't have noticed that? I find that pretty hard to believe. It stands to reason there were other perhaps un-related reasons Myers was booted than his objections to the content of the movie. Furthermore, if the producer deliberately started a discussion, then it only further stands to reason he didn't mind opposing viewpoints toward the movie.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Of course. The makers of Expelled were within their right to expel the very same people that they were attempting to demean in the film. It's perfectly legal, but it was also a rude, hypocritical, and stupid PR move that is rightfully being criticized. Certainly... just like how the makers of Expelled have repeatedly refused to publish the interviews in full. It's not just that PZ and Dawkins object to the content of the movie -- the makers of Expelled don't want them to be able to object in the first place. It's always been their favorite argument against PZ to dangle over the head of his criticisms the fact that he hasn't even seen the movie. They can't pull that one on Dawkins anymore, which is to their disadvantage, but fortunately they managed to spot PZ before it was too late. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Again, maybe there were private reasons for him being " expelled " that had nothing to do with Myers views about evolution or the movie. They let Dawkins in and Myers ' party, as well as initiated discussion at the end ( according to your own statements ) so obviously they weren't against having other views expressed there. Something's iffy here -- it doesn't add up. It makes more sense there were private and unrelated reasons he was not allowed in.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Private, definitely. Unrelated, absolutely not. PZ once called in to a radio show that was talking with Mathis, and by the end of the show, Mathis was so infuriated and desperate that he screamed, " Go to his website! Myers is an atheist! He's an atheist! " Of particular irony is that during the show, Mathis claimed PZ ridicules students for their religious beliefs in his biology class ( which, if I may say as one of his students, is not true ), and then Mathis goes on to ridicule PZ for his. Mathis hates PZ on a very private level. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If that blog is any indication, looks like there's a serious personal thing between BOTH these guys. Anyone who says he proud to be a " militant atheist " has issues -- if they're out to intentionally OPPOSE religion rather than simply hold to their views, then they are no better than the Pat Robertsons or Jerry Falwells of religion. Atheism shouldn't be an aggressive force out to oppose something. After all, we've been told here time and time again that it's an " ism ", merely a lack of belief in God. Frankly this looks like two fundies from two very different views having it out, and putting on a big show while they're at it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So, you wouldn't describe yourself as opposed to Islam's treatment of women? You simply hold your views on this subject? Sorry, but nothing says people who don't have a religion can't oppose religion. It's also important to remember that " militant atheists " like Dawkins and Myers aren't opposed to people having religion. What they are opposed to is creationism and the intelligent design movement, the religious indoctrination of children, the attempt to subvert the separation of church and state, and the amazing amount of violence that comes about as a result of religious conflict. Being opposed to those things is not something someone should be proud of? Well, whatever floats your boat...</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10215_44_42__45_46_47_48_49_50_51_52_53_54_55_56_57_59_65_66_67_68_69_70_71_72_73_74_75_76_77_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Still no evidence from the imbecile Xcaliber backing up his assertion that I defended ID.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>talking to yourself won't help you, Ask your brother EZ, He's tried it too. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Sill waiting for the evidence that I defended ID..............................<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Still waiting for you to Admit you are wrong.... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I am not wrong and you have provided nothing to show otherwise.

Nothing more I can do. :) <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I will give you benefit of the doubt due to the obvious limition of your capacity of comprehension. The assertion that an assumption is reasonable does not assert that the assumption itself is correct. Nowhere in the posts you quoted did I state that ID or even god exists. I even go on to state on both quotes that the assumption would have no scientific value which by any standards is not defending the assumption of ID and even God as correct. There assumption of witches and demons was not unreasonable in the middle ages because they were a reasonable assumption gleaned from the only ' knowledge ' available at the time which was itself a bunch of assertions. There were enough provisos in both posts for it to be obvious that I did not defend ID. Apology accepted :)<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Well I knew before I even posted those quotes that you would claim this.. you still defended ID as being reasonable... lol :) <br><b>S1:7-  </b>I defended the assumption of ID as being reasonable and of course you should know that I claim it.. I posted it more than once. What you WERE confused with was the validity of the assumption as opposed to actuality of what assumed.. not your fault but I indulged you with another of many attempts to educate you... you had the excuse of ignorance then but not now. Posting up quotes and repeating your mistake does not make you right.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>I don't need a little XXXXX like you educating me on anything.. That you should get clear..

I notice that you called me little.. knowing that you dont actually know how big I am I assume you must be massive... are you fat? I dont think it is unreasonable to assume you are massive due too your assumption that I am small compared to you but that does not mean my assumption is correct. I assume that if you are massive it is probably because you are fat.. this is because most massive people are massive due to being overweight and also it would explain your projected hatred... poor self esteem. However my assumption that you are fat although not unreasonable does not mean that my assumption is correct only that it is not unreasonable to assume it :) That lesson was free<br><b> S2:8-  </b>Only thing you proved is how ignorant you are. <br><b>S1:9-  </b>Translation..

But I asked you first and if you will answer I think I can clear up the misunderstanding. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Actually I asked first :) then you asked had I ever met a complete adult. And, I answered this... I said something along the lines that I'd judge them by what I know - but the point is you say a ) that something ' is ' and b ) that you don't know it ' is '.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>How do you know what the people you are judging are doing? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I said that I would make a guess based on what I would be able to tell. I've already stated it before. You said you know and don't know. You didn't say that you assumed that they were good people. You made a categorical statement.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So you're saying you can't know when someone is successful you just take a guess. Is that what you are saying? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>At least I've given you an answer. You've not provided one.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I    m just wondering why when I stated that both my kids were successful, you question how I knew that but you don    t see any problem with you guessing about someone else being successful. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>It was the way you worded it. You made a bold statement, not a cautious one as I suggested I would do. So I wanted to know how you were so sure. Becuase you made a grand statement of both certainty and then you said you were uncertain. Hence you seem confused. I can see what you're hinting at, but you fail simply because of the wording of your original statement. If you wanted to re-write it to a more cautious one, then you'd have a valid point. :) In the same confused way you keep telling me I believe in two gods.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Although I don    t know what either of my kids are doing every minute of the day, based on their jobs, their contribution to society, and their dedication to their families, I judge them to be successful adults. Does that meet with your apparent sensitivity to any kind of absolute statements that are not approved by your church? LOL I think I outlined the analysis in detail pretty well. Besides I wasn    t telling you as you already know it. Well maybe you don    t if you haven    t checked with your church yet. But I was pointing it out to anyone else reading the post. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Perhaps you should check with my church. LOL but it's quite funny for you to describe your reasoning as ' logic '.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Looked pretty logical to me. No one has pointed out where the logic broke down yet. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>I did. You have yet to show a ) the verse from which you refer b ) that it was read the way you have read it. That you have failed to do either ( the second being the most important ) means that you've made an assumption and despite facts to the contrary assume you are right. It is as I said on another post interesting that you've only accused me of believing this two god theory of yours, and no other Christian... even Biblicists... and here's the funny thing... I'm not a believe in sola scriptura, and mentioned this on several posts, but don't let that get in the way... just keep telling me that I've got to believe in something the way you think I should.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>I'm actually suprised you haven't read or at least heard this verse. But I'm not doing your research for you. Even if I told you exactly where it was, you'd just say your church didn't interpret it that way. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>I am not as well versed with Scipture as I should be. But then I am not overly-concentrated on it like the sola scriptura churches are either. Exactly! We don't. So stop telling us that we do!<br><b> S2:8-  </b>Easy, Easy.

If evolution includes God then I can accept it fully.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What we're saying is that it doesn't exclude god. There is a difference since it is a total unknown how life actually started. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That's fair, your not willing to fully accept God, but you are leaving the door open. I can deal with that :)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That is like saying that I'm not willing to accept the tooth faery or the Easter Bunny. Provide some credible, verifible, and unbiased evidence and I will believe, though belief and worship are not the same things. BTW, the bible is none of these, it is only the belief of those who wrote. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Like I said Charchuk, I got no debate with you, but frankly that statement makes me sad. Firstly the whole point of Christianity is that we never know for sure until we die... the belief is called FAITH ( in Jesus ), without faith you cannot be saved from an eternity in hell. If you knew anything of Christianity you wouldn't have even made that statement because PROOF will only come during the events of Revelations, and when that occures it will be to late for the lost souls. I know that will probably just get a " Deleted Preaching " or something like that, but just thought I'd let you know you will never get verifible evidence... God won't let it happen.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Because you can't actually offering anything which mets this? Wrong, Christianity also teaches that faith is the samething as knowledge. Several Christians on here even stated such. That faith is evidence enough. Oh, I know quite a bit about Christianity. More so than many Christians know about it. Actually, when they were first going to add the BoR many Christians of the time didn't wanted it added because they felt that it directly contradicted Christ's teachings. Plus, the BoR is made of a group of letters written by John of Potmost to the churches in Asia Minor about his interpreations of the Book of Daniel, world politics of the time ( He thought that Nero was the anti-Christ since 666 is the symbol for Nero's name ). That is because you can't prove a negative. I would change god to the Big Blue Banana and it would still mean the same thing. All religious claims are equal. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>??? I don't no what that is supposed to say... The reason that statement made me said is because you said even if God was proven, and you believed that he exisited, that you wouldn't worship him... that made me sad... what did you think i meant?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You believe in the existence of Satan, do you worship him as well? You'll say no because Satan is evil. Well Satan is nothing incomparison to your god for things evil. Remember, your god created Satan. The god of the OT is a sadistic monster. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Well actually Satan is cast down angel... So yes he created the angel, but Satan made his own choices and let pride take control. You can't judge a fathers character by his sons actions can you? If my real life father was a saint does that automaticly make me one too? No. I have free will and can make my own choices, based on what the Bible teaches angels also have free will, otherwise a third of them wouldn't have fallen and been cast out of heaven.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Yes, I know who Satan was suppose to be. Actually he was Lucifer one of god's archangels. And he was cast out for basically loving a woman and rebelling because god forbid it. God knew all along what Lucifer would do and this let him. Remember, according to Christian mythology god only gave free will to us humans, not to angels. Yes, you can and many do. If you can jusde a child's actions by their father's actions than it works both ways. ISA 14:21 Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers ; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities. Free will is only an illusion. There is much contradiction in the bible. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Lucifer is actually a babylonian king if i remember correctly, satan is satan, he is not given any other name, but it is common for many christian and non-christian to mix that verse up and understand it as lucifer as being satan... but he is not. Satan was cast out of heaven because of pride, nothing more nothing less. He thought he was the most beautiful of God's creation and he thought is was better. Pride. Yes, angels used to have the gift of free will too... I'm not sure what you are talking about... God did not create evil or sin, satan did. Satan was given free will like the other angels and some how he got it in his head that his absolute power was greater then God's... obviously he was wrong...<br><b> S2:6-  </b>I was taught that the devil was Lucifer, the most beaultiful archangel of them all. Look the name up and you'll get a different story than what you're telling. Isa 14:12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! It is the same in the Book of Revelation with the beast being talked about being Nero. God must of known about it to begin with since god is all-knowing. Why would he allow Lucifer to have pride? I was taught a different story about from Lucifer rebelled against god. I'm not sure you know what you're talking about. God created Satan. I thought that you just said that Satan and Lucifer weren't the same? Now I will tell you where satan came from. Sat and Tan were two evil natual forces in paganism. The image all Christians have of the devil also comes from paganism as well with the male representive of nature Pan. Though he wasn't evil as Christians had turned him into. This was an effort to convert Pagans to Christianity when it had invaded the rest of Europe. In fact this is also when Christianity " adopted " much of its current rituals, rites, and holidays as well. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>Yes this is the verse that most quote, remember verses shouldn't be taken literally... I am horrible at explaining things, but after doing a quick search I found this which confirms what I've said... http://www.lds-mormon.com/lucifer.shtml What is so difficult to understand? Without free will you can not truely love someone. If you don't have the " choice " to love God, and are just created to love God then do you really love him? Yes angels had free will, I will gather theories on this if you feel it is an important enough issue. God created everything what's your point? If humans have the capacity to evolve so does God's other creations. They can choose to follow God or their own wishes ( Evil ). I did, when have a contradicted myself? How does that statement you quoted disagree with what I've said? Lucifier is a babylonian king, Satan is satan who is a fallen angel. Okay??? The Satan I speak of is referred to by Jesus, the apostles and other bible verses. Unlike other beliefs Christianity has no alterior motive, if you've actually read the Bible it only speaks of being good, more like Jesus, a better person, sin free. Jesus asks nothing of you but faith in him.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>You're a mormon? That makes you a heretic, and of course not a real Christian. :) We were talking about Lucifer. Angels don't have free will. That was god's gift to us monkeys ( I wonder if you'll get the reference? :) ) Calling something a theory when it is only belief is only confusing the term. The angels were suppose to be created perfect, without sin. Only man is a flawed creation. Afterall we do sin. :) Wrong. You are following your heresy. All an adoption from pagan beliefs in order to turn them away from their own gods towards the Christian god. All conquerors say the same thing, " We bring you peace and order... " As to what I think of religious, or blind faith... " Human life and destiny is always endangered when prophets of whatever sort demand, ' Frage nicht, glaube! ' Do not question. Believe! " - Jack Forstman <br><b>S1:8-  </b>no I'm not. That happened to be the first page that came up in my search that supported what I was saying, I guess I should have taken more time and found another source ( and actually looked at the URL ). Although I may very well be wrong, I've been reading so many things from so many contradicting sources. If I'm mistake thanks for redirecting me :) You may have been talking about satan / lucifier stricktly but I was jumping back and forth. Obviously angels MUST have free will otherwise a third wouldn't have fallen, would they have? or am I mistaken here? I am willing to be corrected if I am wrong. my mistake, sorry. Well obviously I don't believe in Blind faith, otherwise I wouldn't spend so much time surfing the web reading hundreds of contradicting opinions and beliefs... I've probably said it before, but I'm always looking for truth, and fact is since I was a kid my opinions on many of my stances have changed. I'm still a Christian, but in my opinion I'm one of the best kind, one that is always asking questions and searching... no one has all the answers or it altogether<br><b> S2:8-  </b>Religion is nothing by contradiction. There is no real logic to it. Another contradictory belief in Christianity. Yet you still believe. That is blind faith. Only searching for the answers you want to find and ignoring all which doesn't agree. That is also blind faith. <br><b>S1:9-  </b>So many things in our imperfect existence contradict eachother, there is so much gray in life. You can make a statement like that about virtually anything. Especially the unknowns.<br><b> S2:9-  </b>None of them claim to be perfect as those who are religious do. In the real world when something contradicts another it is looked into to see why and then straightened out. In religion they cover it with, " God works in mysterious ways and it is not up to us mere mortals to understand god's Plan ( tm ). " In the past when a person pointed out contradictions in religious beliefs they were usually charged with heresy and burned at the stake.</p></body> </html>
