<br><b>S1:1-  </b>As usual you ignored the part that seems to conflict with your theory. Why are they white? Again you miss the point. " evolutionists see that as proof " That is an interpretation not scientific fact. I have given lots of evidence that supports creation. You are asking for a smoking gun. Neither side has one of those<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Peddler, It's a simple matter of composition. The truly white sections of the cliffs ( most of the cliffs are not in fact, white ) are composed of almost pure calcium carbonate - a soft, white stone also commonly referred to as chalk or soapstone. Don't take my word for it though, educate yourself. http://www.geologyshop.co.uk/chalk1.htm Waxy <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Why are they white meant why are they so pure that they are not discolored by contaminates. Allthough you seem to think so being a creationist does not make you stupid. I know what the cliffs are made of as does anybody who ever polished a car, a least before clear coats. The question is how did those numberless sea creatures collect in a way that filtered out any other particles-80 + % purity - over millions of years? There really is no reasonable answer for that question I have ever heard. It seems quite impossible to me. What is your answer?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Didn't you read the link? Here it is again. http://www.geologyshop.co.uk/chalk.htm It's all nicely laid out for you in a concise answer if you'd bother. Now you've heard the answer. You may also want to look into shales and other homogeneous clastic and carbonate rocks that form in much the same depositional manner. Deposition rates, especially when biologically driven as in the chalks, can be very rapid, rates can also be very slow, depending on erosion rates, water transport, water depth, etc... It's not rocket science, merely common sense. Waxy <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I have heard all of this before I am aware that it was much more tropical when the chalks formed.. I still disagree that these amazingly clear seas could have remained unchanged for millions of years. It is impossible for to some people see that their is more than one way to look at evidence. Your interpretation is an educated guess not fact. So is mine. No one was there to watch it form. Just because I disagree does not mean I am right or you are wrong. It means we disagree. Not so long ago it was believed that it took millions of years to form the Great Barrier Reef. That idea became hard to sell when the tourist started asking how many millions of years it took for the coral to grow on the chains supporting the observation platforms. Now it is down to 3800 years. Science is often wrong in it's interpretations of evidence it is unwise to not question it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I thought it was clear that it didn't require millions of years of steady state in order to produce the chalk? At any rate - I've given you an explanation, now it's your turn to buck up and present your explanation. Hopefully it will also contain the basics as to your reasoning why your explanation is more valid, or even as valid, as the currently accepted model proposed above. Please note that the Bible is not justification for your case, we're strictly talking about scientific validity and evidence. Waxy <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Why not. There is no way that either of us can know what happened. The whole point is you believe that although you have no proof that you are right that everyone else is stupid for not agreeing with you. All I wanted to do was get you to open your mind to the fact other opinions including ones that support the Bible that may be valid. My crowbar is bending in the effort. You seem constitutionally incapable of accepting that evidence must be interpreted or have been brainwashed into never daring to think outside the box. If evidence spoke for itself we would not need law lawyers or courts. To bad it does not.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You're right. We are little kids asking questions, and your the idiot father / mother / grandmother who pretends to know something, but you obviously don't. Us : Dad / Mom / Grandma, what's a quasar? You : Umm... its kinda like a laser... a uhh... quasilaser. Yes.... Us : What? But according to this dictionary, a quasar is an : You : WHAT??!! LIES!!! ALL LIES!!! I CAN NOT BE WRONG. I AM THE MESSENGER OF GOD!!!!!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>http://www.haltonarp.com/ <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Right......<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You just can't grasp the difference between opinion and fact or that evidence does not speak for itself. Any evidence or even facts that don't support your woldrview are ignored, imaginary senarios that do you state as fact. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>peddler, I still don't know what you are talking about.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Here is an example of 2 ways to look at the same evidence. The white cliffs of dover. There are 3 major diamateous earth deposits on the planet. The purity level is very high. That is why they are white. The evolutionists sees it as proof of millions of years because how could so many tiny sea creatures accumlualte quickly? The creationist looks at them and decides it must have happened quickly or they would not be white. He can see no series of events that would prevent almost anything else but pure white diatoms collecting in one paticular spot, no dirt to speak of, no other sea creatures etc. Both are opinions of what the evidence says, neither are proof. Does that make sense to you? Evidence does not speak for itself. To quote an interpretation as fact without substantial observable and repeatable evidence is political / religious dogma, not science. Science means knowledge-to know. Not to guess. Conscience means with knowledge.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The scientific method : predict then see if evidence supports the prediction. I am willing to submit to this and prove God. IF you cannot agree to this then you are really saying you will not recognize any evidence which proves God as such. IOW, your CLAIM to want to entertain evidence for God in the first place was phony - a sham. waiting and ready..... Ray M.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>this is not really the scientific method, because the prediction is usually based on an objective observation. also, the evidence needs to be qualified as both objective and relevant to the prediction anyway, i'd like to hear the prediction <br><b>S1:2-  </b>AGREED. Your input above gets more specific and adds substance to the loose framework I want to work within. We now agree a prediction MUST be in place and we agree that IF the prediction is supported with tangible objective observable evidence then rational persons must accept it as proof supporting the claims / prediction. Prediction : Impossibility = Divine involvement. Central and well known Bible claims IF supported by the above criteria = impossibility. I can support the following central Bible claims according to the prediction above : 1 ) Existence of Satan / hell. 2 ) Mankind on a downward path to hell. 2 ) Miraculous Exodus from Egypt. 3 ) Law given to Moses. 4 ) Death and Resurrection of Christ. 5 ) Age of the Church which claims its existence by the grace of God. IF I can, by the method already agreed to, that THESE claims are true then on this basis the Deity of the Bible is real and is in control of history. And IF true Darwinism and ToE is falsified IN ITS TRACKS - END OF SUBJECT. waiting..... Ray M.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>ray! you the man! ok, last things first, the only proof you can provide that would falsify darwinism and the ToE is either that God created the world as geneisis 1 and 2 describes, or some other process of creation. proving that the israelites exodused from egypt or that mankind is going to hell does not disprove evolution ok, with that out of the way, your menu of devine phenomena looks scrumptious! asking you to prove all would be both time consuming and unnecessary ; each could well deserve a thread of its own i'd like to see you prove 3 ) God gave the ten commandments, carved in stone, to moses. i picked the one that to me looks falsifiable upon physical evidence without going to deep into the ethereal realm of faith and visions. the tablet of stone, if it existed, is something physical. since you volunteered to prove this, id like to here it <br><b>S1:3-  </b>IF the 5 things listed are true then from this basis everything else in the Bible must be true = logic. If you don't agree then I am wasting my time and you are silently admitting no amount of evidence can falsify Darwinism. You are, like I've said peddaling philosophy as science. waiting..... Ray M.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>ok, ray, for the sake of the discussion, i'll concede that you proying ANY of the items on your list will build a very strong case for creation over evolution. however, strictly speaking, proving that the israelites left egypt, or that mankind is spiritually declining towards hell, or that christ died and resurrected, or anything like that does not directly address the evidence that supports darwin's theories or evolution. they are pretty unrelated. that said, i'd be extremely impressed with any type of argument you can put forward to prove any of these things. even if it doesnt directly disprove the theory of evolution ( and i really dont understand how you could expect them to disprove that ), it would prove that the phenomenon described in the bible are legit, and would give atheists something to think about. that in itself is major <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Proving the miracles of the Resurrection of Christ and the Red Sea crossing logically support the sudden creation of Genesis. If you can't agree to this logic then you are totally brainwashed lacking any objectivity whatsoever. Sudden creation is through-out the Bible. ToE says man began as an animal then gradually got better to his present state today over millions of years. The Bible says man BEGAN as a man and not an animal and was intelligent unlike an animal. These two scenrios are far apart and only one can be correct. The same source for the miracle claims says the belief that God is not the origin of created things is a penalty from God for not crediting Him AS the Creator. Therefore, this claim is evidently true IF the big miracle claims are because Darwinism exists and is thus explained as this penalty. At any rate, my NEXT post will evidence my claims. Ray M.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>you seriously lack the foggiest clue about logic. what you are doing is the same as me concluding that big foot exists by proving that paper is made from trees. both are completely independent of each other, and evidence for one is ireelevant to the other. proving thatsatan exists, mankind is going to hell, the israelites left egypt, or ANY of the things on your list does not prove or even support the idea that man was created intelligent. all these things could be true, and you'd still be no closer to proving that God created 1 man in a garden out of dirt 6000 - 10000 years ago, no more than you could conclude that pigs fly by proving ice is colder than fire.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I dont blame you. Humans by nature are religious animals. If you believe in religion, you cant think outside the box. When i used to be catholic, i had the same problem, it prevents you from being open minded. You shunn everything else, and are very narrow minded. Im not offending you, you cant help it. Its just nature.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Said the scorpion to the mouse after stinging him. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>My point exactly. Nature sucks, but you cant help it.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Why not?......... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Because, if you kill all scorpions, to prevent them from eating mice, then the mice will overpopulate and starve to death, killing both scorpions and mice. Nature is a spoiled child, it always gets its way.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No I mean why not for people. Can we not control our selves? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Do we want to have control over ourselves? Some religios fanatics dont, and thats what im saying. I dont know much on this matter, im only 14. But, ive been to a Conservative catholic school, and ive seen what it's like. Its a narrow minded hellhole.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>We fix it by changing the way people think. We will start here.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I wasn't trying to distract you. So maybe I shouldn't have included " oaf. " I still respect myself very much so. Thank you kindly. It has nothing whatsoever to do with pride. I would glady give my life for my beliefs. I meant it only to make a point, but you want to make a whole issue out of it. I've been in the Gulf war and almost lost my life, so don't tell me I don't know what it's like. I was discharged at 100% disability from the military. I've been in other situations I don't care to list here or feel necessary to list here. There you go assuming again.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Your personal life is irrelavent to the matter at hand. You either have evidence, or you don't. I predict then if you present it, it will be a rerun of the typical creationist junk that has been seen, and discredited numerous amounts of time. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You should read all the post before you make an statement. Pandion is the one who brought personal lives into the conversation, which was between me and him by the way. :)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Actually, you did. You kept on claiming ' Would you bet your life on it '. I would say that is 1 ) the avoidence technique known as distraction, and 2 ) bringing personality into it. That is how I read it, of course. How.. about that evidence.. feel free to show it when you actually have some. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Did you not read the post above this one. Did I direct the question at you. No, I did not. I wasn't trying to distract anyone dude, get a grip. I asked the question for my own darn reason, not for you to know. The question was only for Duo _ Maxwell.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You posted it in a public forum. You do know the concept of a public forum don't you?? You know.. where multiple people can see what you write and make comments on it?? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>It may be a public forum, but there are times when you shouldn't intrude on a discussion. It's just common sense courtesy. :)<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Dude, your arguments are flimsy at best. Who said I get all of my knowledge from christianity, but there is knowledge there. Oh course I wouldn't believe you were the messiah, you have the wrong attitude and I doubt you could perform any miracles. Jesus would go around saying he is the Son of God. There is so much more to it than you than you wrote. :)<br><b> S2:1-  </b>1 BWWHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Comedy Gold. Your funny. Keep on believing a lunatic who thought he was the son of God. 2. Jesus didn't perform any mircales either. A book written after the fact says he did. A book that is, in many cases, wrong and contradictory. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Your making the assertion, so prove it. You should however take it to the Religion Forum<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I did prove it. I explained easily why science is better than imaginary metaphysics. You don't understand Occam's Razor. I cannot help you there. There is no proof for miracles, they cannot be duplicated, they cannot be falsified. There is no method of validating them. The only cases of evidence are anecdotal, and anecdotal evidence is spurious and not admissible. I have already proven how it's contradictory in many cases already. The Idea of Creation and God are easily shaved away by the Razor, because they are complex explanations that are unnecessary to explain any given phenomenon. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Just because there is no factual proof Jesus performed miracles doesn't mean they didn't occur. There are no proven absolute truths for christianity or evolution.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Just because there is no evidence that I am God, doesn't meant that I am not God. However, to believe I am God with no factual evidence is absurd, as is Christianity and all religions, actually. I never said they didn't occure. I said it's stupid to believe in them because there is no evidence. If you honestly cannot differentiate between a rational belief based on fact and an irrational concept that only exists either in your head or without facts to back it up, then you admitt you are incapable of separating a good theory from a bad theory. Are you praising the fact that you should believe in something with no proof, just because you cannot prove it didn't happen? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I have all the proof I need, just because it doesn't meet your standard doesn't matter. Sounds like a personal problem to me.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>All I'm saying is that it is a lot larger leap, based on common sense, to say " The Universe began when an uncreated atom exploded causing a chain reaction that eventually lead to the creation of all in the Universe through mere happenstance...<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Well, fine. If you can quote a scientist claiming the above, I'll join you in declaring her mistaken. You could be searching a long time. You have missed the point entirely. Whose help was needed to bring the supernatural being into being? If the answer is ' no-one's ', why can that not suffice for the rest of the universe? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I quote Kelvin, the creator of the temperature system by the same name "... the atheistic idea is so non-sensical that I cannot put it into word. " Maybe that's our problem.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, it's your problem. Lord Kelvin is not on record as having said " The Universe began when an uncreated atom exploded causing a chain reaction that eventually lead to the creation of all in the Universe through mere happenstance... ". That is the position you are asked to defend. Have you ever heard of the argument fallacy called ' Appeal to Authority '? I'll see your Lord Kelvin, and raise you one Stephen Hawking. Impressed? If you are, you have no idea what rational debate is about. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not when I have names like Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Newton, Sir Francis Bacon, Newton, Descartes, Boyle, Faraday, Maury, Joule, Maxwell, Heisenberg, Von Braun, and a not so theistic but still believer in a creation of some sort named Einstein. It appears the recent opposition in some scientific circles seems to be revolutionary, not mine.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>OMG. It seems nate 895 really does believe in argument by appeal to authority. Oh, the poor man.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You didnt understand the answer.. even though you posted it<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You didn't answer. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Its there if you look... once again you think I didnt answer because my answer was not the one you wanted<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No you set up the criteria in which you would respect views, you did not answer my question which did not ask what the criteria was but if you were literally referencing views / beliefs. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The criteria was enough to answer the question.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I don't see how. Perhaps you could elaborate on the implication your criteria has on my question?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Try and stay on topic Oreo, and current too. And why should I rehash month old debates with a troll who didn't even bother registering to participate in the debate? I will say this though, You're as dishonest as those who accused me of purposely posting hoaxes. But believe what you like as it has no affect on my life at all.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This has quite a lot to do with what you have claimed as to critical thinking. Obviously you have shown none. So, in your view, bringing up any sort of evidence that contradicts your claims are " troll " ing. You shouldn't be so sensitive, Archangel. As to me not registering, I like to investigate boards first to see if they are even worth posting in, not to mention the fact that the others had you aptly handled in that issue. So, what, did you accidentally cut and paste the link? do you have a sort of twitch that causes you to type in random addresses that go to hoax sites and then copy and paste them here? If not, then you purposely posted them here, and you are being dishonsest for claiming otherwise. There is no dishonesty in pointing out your errors, although I am not suprised to see that you think so - such a mindset is typical of religious fanatics. I'm not trying to insult you, Archangel, I am just being brutally honest with you. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Sure you're not. Believe what you like, your opinion is meaningless to me.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>And why is that, Archangel? Because I am an atheist? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yes. You have nothing to offer that is edifying or positive. You preach a gospel of death and self. If you were at least seeking the truth it would be different, but you seem very committed to atheism and that means we will never relate to each other. I feel sorry for your condition but understand you will only strike back at any attempt I made to reach out to you.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>By changing one word : " atheism " to " christianity ", this exact statement could be made about you. Here, I'll show you : Unlike what I have seen of you, however, a person's personal belief doesn't affect whether or not their opinions are meaningless to me - how they argue and whether or not they use falsehoods, etc. DOES. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>See what I mean?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Do you ever get tired of posting garbage, watching it get refuted and then running away like a coward?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>do you ever get tired of contributing nothing but brain-dead rhetoric? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I'm sure others will see the irony in this post and laugh quite loudly. Do I need to remind you of the erosion claims you've made that you keep avoiding? Please answer me this : A baby bird died and fell do the ground. A time capsule my great, great, great grandfather buried was eroded to the surface. Which one is older?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>depends on when the baby bird died. run along little boy.. let the adults debate. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Four seconds ago. Like the adults that understand what EROSION means? Or perhaps what the word STRATA? or maybe the concepts of FLUID MECHANICS? You'll run away from all your threads. Because you're a creationist. That's what you do : flee.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>why don't you address my OP, smart guy..?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I have highlighted the relevant points. To sum up : Matthew is stupid, blind and generally wrong having only shallow unsupportable personal opinions, whereas Archie must be right because he ' knows ' god, knows exactly what each verse of the bible means, and thus cannot possibly be wrong, and should not be questioned on any matter. This as it stands is absolute and irrevocable proof that Archie is completely infallible. However, to paraphrase Captain Edmund Blackadder, there is one tiny flaw in this argument. It is bollocks.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Once again Matthew rips a statement out of context in order to distorts what was said so as to make a fallacious point. Notice what smiley said below which I was responding to. Notice how strongly he claimed me to be completely infallible which I denied of course. You are so uninformed regarding the attribute of infallibility that you attribute it to me just for being certain about the issue of salvation according to the Gospel of Christ which I AM absolutely correct about. Either that, or you're dishonestly attempting to claim that I do think myself to be infallible just for confidently defending the single issue of the salvation process. So which is Matt? Are you just ignorant or being dishonest? I mean, every believer knows that only God is infallible and can NEVER be wrong. So I expect such an accusation coming from smiley, but once again you disappoint me since you prefer to promote the lie from an atheist rather than defend the truth I offer you. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>But you don't offer the truth. Your lies on this forum have been catalogued on many occasions for all to see. How you can keep up the pretence that you represent the truth is beyond me.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Speaking of being truthful, you just quoted my response to your lie that I am infallible, and I refuted that lie so now you come back as inconsistent as ever and talk about being truthful. WE WERE DISCUSSING INFALLIBILITY SMILEY, IS IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO STAY ON POINT? OR WILL YOU JUST GO FROM INSULT TO INSULT ATTEMPTING TO MAKE A HIT ON ME? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I have not insulted you in the least. I merely speak the truth. You should try it some time.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Only in your mind could lying about me be telling the truth smiley. And if you had any concept of what truth is, you wouldn't be an anti-christian atheist my spiritually blind friend.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>If the force of expansion is so weak, then all things would have collapsed into the point of explosion after it started?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You forget the inverse square law. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>How does this apply? The " Big Bang " theory says all things were in " zero space " so distance would not be a factor the nano-second it started.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>First, the big bang was not an explosion. That would imply mass expanding outwards into an ' empty ' medium. This is not the case : space expanded. * Damn, my patient arrived. will continue ASAP :) ABE : the fundemental forces were not separated at the T =0 point so no gravity to affect it. Hope that helps. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>That is a huge claim. So, in such situations, laws can be broken?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But, it is true. The reason why T =0 is so mysterious is because the ' laws ' we have break down at that position of the universe. Much like how Newtonian ' laws ' don't work at quantum scales and quantum field theory breaks down ( in some cases ) at Planck scales. We don't know enough at this point in time but that does not mean that we don't know a hell of a lot. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Amazing, when did they go there to figure that out? When they look at these today they see the amount of matter in that space. Even if the universe was in such a small space, it still is ALL of the matter that exists today. There is no way to observe the universe in zero space so we know nothing of such things.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>What happens is the mathematical models of the universe we have get wound backwards and it all works! Right up until we get very close to T =0. Then our maths gives results like infinity ( which are meaningless in this context ). This means we can't trust our models at that position of the universe. I don't understand your meaning. But we can give very accurate descriptions of just before T =0 by winding our mathematical models ' backwards '. But as I said, if we go too close to T =0 the maths stops making sense. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>So this adds up to " the math makes no sense, therefore inverse square law ".???<br><b> S2:5-  </b>No. your point wast that at T =0 there was no space so gravity was strong enough to prevent any expansion of space. I was pointing out only that gravity did not exist at that position of the universe. You then went on to say that we could not check this point and I replied with mathematical models that could be ' wound backwards ' along time but that they become less and less accurate as we approach T =0. My original point was that gravity is more weak than the metric expansion of space when the distances invloved are large as this invokes the inverse squre law as it applies to gravity ( and it cannot take advantages of it's cumulative effects ). Remember the metric expansion of space only ocures at super cluster scales. In smaller scalse gravity wins out.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I just noticed this. Kay, you need to retake evolutionary biology 101. Never has evolutionary theory, since Darwin's day, taught us that species go from simple to complex ; maybe in the first couple million years of multicellular evolution, but since then, no. To quote one of my profs, " organisms are delicate reflections of their environment ". Organisms don't get more complex, they adapt to environmental changes to better suit it. On top of that, you have a misunderstanding of the second law of thermodynamics. It applies to entities in a closed environment. The Earth, and the various ecosystems which comprise it, is far from closed. Also, pertaining to the point I've made above, environments on Earth are always changing. This is because the Earth is definitely an open environment. Your question of " where did DNA come from? " and the subsequent conclusion of there being a designer is an unfalsifiable assumption, and thus fails one of the major objectives of a scientific theory. I am not interested in nonscientific, unsupported assertions, and the scientific community won't be either, and that's why ID is deemed " pseudoscience ".<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Then your professor admits evolution does not explain the advancement of life, for that advancement constitutes a massive increase in complexity. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>YOU have a misunderstanding of evolution as well. The reason Darwin never used the word " evolution " was because at the time, evolution meant advancement, and that isn't what he meant. No scientifically literate individual will claim that evolution explains the " advancement of life ", because evolution has never claimed such a thing. Like I said, evolution is far easier than people think ; all it is is a change in allele frequencies in a population. A large punctuation may occur, and that's probably what you're talking about, and that would account for your misunderstanding. The implications of evolution are far reaching, and they are based on the basic principle that I've mentioned.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I doubt that. Good. I noticed he spent an inordinate amount of time on scenarios involving diversity between homologous populations living in isolation from each other ( speciation in progress ) imagine that :p Glad to know I'm scientifically literate. Observe the following logic : 1. Life has advanced greatly from a single celled organism 2. Evolution is the process by which a single simple ancestor generated all known life. 3. Evolution is the process which advanced life greatly. 1 + 2 necessitates 3, if 3 is false than either 1 or 2 must be as well. Claiming 1 is false is akin to that something is nothing ( clear contradiction ) XXXX coming up in other threads. Leaving only 2. What has my so called ID, creationist theocratic, ignorant self been asserting about evolution all this time? 2, apparently the only thing a scientifically literate person can think <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Evolution is not a process which advances a species from generation to generation. Nor would I argue, that species are becoming more advanced, via evolution or not, with the exception of the first couple million years of multicellular evolution. The only reason I am saying this is to illustrate how deeply uneducated you are when it comes to evolutionary theory. To think that my professor, and other evolutionists would claim that evolution is a process of improvement within a species from one gen to the next would be a misunderstanding of evolutionary theory, the argument for evolution and a sheer lack of education on your part.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>As demonstrated by IC analysis. Sounds like ignorance speaking there, there has been advancement for a very long time. Mammals aren't just fancy shaped lizards, we're superior to most cold-blooded life as can be seen clearly both in the present and in the fossil record. ROFL, well you have two audiences for that ; you've got the evolutionist who've already decided to ignore or quit on me ; and then you've got me. You're not doing a very good job on me, and those evolutionist are already convinced. Yet for hundreds of pages self-described evolutionist refused to accept my conclusion which was just that, because indeed they did think evolution explained the advancement of life.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I wonder if being gay is a genetic, or environmental behaviour. Some say it is genetic, but im not so sure, because if it were genetic, then it would be exceedingly rare, as children cannot come from a same sex union. So someone who was gay from birth would be less likley to mate with someone from the opposite sex, and therefore the gene would be found less and less as time went on. I think being gay is an environmental condition. I read a long time ago that in the animal kingdom, homosexuallity was found in populations where one sex outnumbered the other.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That is a very simplistic view of genetics and natural selection. If the nieces and nephews of a gay person had a slightly raised fecundity for example, then there would be positive selection pressure for such a " gay gene ". <br><b>S1:2-  </b>can you dumb that up a bit for me?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Put crudely, your siblings share some of your genes and so if their kids survive and have kids of their own ( this is how fecundity is measured ), then some of your genes get passed on. If your assistance ( as a homosexual non-reproductive person ) increases the number of reproductively successful offspring your siblings produce then this offsets the fact that you haven't produced any kids yourself. It's a contraversial idea, but it isn't one that can be completely ruled out. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Would the gene not become less prevelant the longer it is inactive? like of a cousin of someone gay is not gay and they have kids and so on for many generations without the occurence of homosexuallity.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>We are talking a hypothetical gene here. If homosexuality has a genetic component, it will be the result of a combination of many genes. Also it is not a simple case of genes fading away becaus they are inactive : it is invariably way more complex than that. The best example I can think of is with the European crested newt. Every one of them is a heterozygous individual ( can't remember for which gene ( s )). They mate and half the offspring are homozygous. Both homozygous forms are fatal in early development and only the heterozygous ones become adults. A whole 50% of the eggs produced die because of a fatal gene combination that the newt cannot escape from...<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I did not touch on this much in my thread-starter, but the concept of plasticity is quite powerful. For instance, depending on what one's diet is early on in life, the organism can be shaped and molded to fit that diet. I believe this is what happens to finches, just as it happens to tadpoles ( see below. ) We used polyphenic spadefoot toad tadpoles ( Spea bombifrons and S. multiplicata ) to test the hypothesis that character displacement evolves to minimize competition for food. We also sought to evaluate the role of phenotypic plasticity in the mediation of competitive interactions between these species. Depending on their diet, individuals of both species develop into either a small-headed omnivore morph, which feeds mostly on detritus, or a large-headed carnivore morph, which specializes on shrimp. http://www.citeulike.org/user/balicea/article/454684 The fact is, darwinists insist that traits are formed by genes, that over time, spread throughout the population. But this absurd and wrong. The truth is that creatures evolve individually -- and all creatures of a population evolve at the same time according to what their habitat is. It's amazing the common sense that has been withheld by the likes of the scientific community. But once common sense is exposed as to how nature really works, the theory of evolution just fizzles away to into obscurity.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Answer the question please <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Your question is a strawman.... because I look at evolution on an individual basis... not a populational basis. Who's to say certain individuals do not develop lighter shades over their lifetime -- or even as the generations pass within his descendants? ( Besides, I do believe that Black Americans are generally lighter shades than black Africans. ) But where can I find these tests on pigmentation changes? Answer : nowhere -- and that's because science is AFRAID of what they might find. ( they could do the same tests on animals -- can you point to these? ) of course you can't. Besides different people have different environments and different habitats. Some work inside, some work outside. Some work all day in 100 heat with lots of sunshine, some lay around all day inside and be lazy in the air condition. Strawman. Try again.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Based on what you say, all individuals should, within a few generations, adapt to the best suited phenotype. The fact this doesn't happen invalidates your " theory ". Nice try Where can I find these tests on the specific type of green cheese that makes up the moon? Answer : nowhere -- and that's because science is AFRAID of what they might find. ( they could do the same test on asteroids -- can you point to these? ) of course you can't. Complete and utter ignorance. Please don't try again. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Your logic is outmatched, man. Give it up.... you've got nothing other than scoffing.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>OK, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and believe ( I actually don't but...) that you aren't sure what the purpose of your post above was supposed to be. That, my friend, was the point where you were supposed to explain how I was in error in my interpretation of your majestic theory. That is the point where you would have taken my rebuttals to your previous statements and shown how I was in error by providing data to bolster your assertions. Or, you could just say " nyah nyah, I can't hear you! " Y'know, whatever works for you...<br><b>S1:1-  </b>er... did I miss something? Where was the formation of breasts in those? Did breasts just pop out instantly? Also, I love those cute little cartoonish artistic renditions of mammal / reptile creatures.... do you have any actual fossils to go along with those?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>More than likely Read. Do some actually research. It's not a hidden secret. No, first the female stuck her finger in her mouth and blew really hard. That's what took so long-they had to wait to evolve fingers. That's nice. I like the cute picture you have of the guy in agony nailed to two sticks of wood. Nope, not a one. Don't you know, fossils were all planted by the devil. We just make this stuff up as we go along to screw with you. You do know what www.google.com is, right? ( I know I'm going to regret this but...) Why? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>what a dumb post. You contribute nothing.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>:( That hurts my feelings coming from such an insightful poster such as yourself. So, what problems with the proposed mechanism for breast development have you turned up in your exhaustive research? If Adam and Eve didn't have belly buttons, why have all the pictures always depicted them with such an accessory? And why do men have nipples? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Men have nipples for the same reason they have any other body part -- because they were created that way. Besides that, according to this link, men can breastfeed.... ( maybe as a substitute if something happened to mom? ) http://www.unassistedchildbirth.com/...s/milkmen.html so take that... Why would nipples be selected for in males in a darwinian world?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Take that?!? That supports the evolutionary theory! http://menshealth.about.com/od/condi...ipples_Men.htm See above. Now, explain to me why god would create his most prized creation with useless nipples. And you never answered my other questions<br><b>S1:1-  </b>what a dumb post. You contribute nothing.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Funny.... that exact same comment can be made about every single post you've made on this and the many other forums you post on. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>So what are all these forums?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Are you actually, seriously, going to try to play dumb here? Let's see - You once posted on Internet Infidels Discussion Boards ( IIDB - remember your " Butterfly Wombs " fiasco there? ), and eventually were banned from there for infractions of the rules - then you came in under the sockpuppet handle of " YourWorstNightMare ", and then rather dumbly revealed that you were really " Supersport " who had been banned ( right in your first post, I might add ) ; Richard Dawkins Foundation Forums ( RDFF ) ; TheologyWeb ( TWeb ) ( with a choice post of yours ) ; Darwin Central ( where you lasted less than a day ) ; and Christian Discussion Forums ( known as CARM.org ). Just to name a few. Edit : Looks like T.Q. already beat me to calling you on your bull, but as I went to the trouble to look up several places you actually posted ( already knew about IIDB, and CARM, as I post there ), I'll leave them up for everyone to investigate. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yeap, I had about a 2 week stint at Secular web... a 2 - days stint at Darwin Central -- both atheist forums who banned me for nothing. I have not regularly posted at the richard dawkins forum ( not banned ) in many many months.... I also no longer post at TheologyWeb... ( not banned ) Nowdays I mainly post here and at Carm. What exactly does it matter though? I guarantee you most everybody on here posts at different forums as well. Quite honestly the only reason I visit this forum on occasion is to read WW's posts.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You asked what forums ( playing dumb of course ), and you were given an answer that shows we won't tolerate your playing dumb ( A. K.A. lying - rather un-Christian, isn't it? ). Ah, they banned you for nothing, eh? I invite everyone to go to those forum and use the search function to look up SS's posts there ( by Secular Web he means IIDB, I believe ), and then the notices of his banning and the reasons. I note you ignored that you attempted to come back at IIDB under the handle " YourWorstNightmare ". <br><b>S1:4-  </b>um... don't you think if I actually did something specific to be banned they would have said it? But no, they list like 5 things, thinking / hoping I must have done something wrong. Not only that but I get banned for life... no suspension of a few days or a week -- total ban for life. Yet they have those foul-mouthed jokers on that site who do little more than call names and engage in a constant barrage of personal insults because that's all they've got to support their nonsense theory. Please notice I'm not banned from this forum after many many months. Don't you think if I didn't know how to act it would show up here? And I was just being honest when I went back on under a different name -- if they wanted to ban me again, then so be it.... which they did. What exactly is your point? The Darwin Central place banned me before 2 whole days for nothing but debating the issue. They obviously did not want me around.... but gave no real reason for banning me.... they're just chickens. Since you like following my movements, why don't you respond to my latest OP : http://www.christiandiscussionforums...ad.php?t=60848<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Yeah. I totally believe you. Dude, I was there on IIDB when you were posting your spam and other $ hit. As I said before, everyone is invited to go and actully look at your posts and such. I like how you admt to using different usernames now. Wonder what other handles you use here. Archie perhaps? Nah, that'd be too obvious. Wascally I suppose, would be a more sensible assumption. Then there was that whole BlackWodin poster back around February or so ( and several other new posters ) that were your loyal cheerleading fans. Too bad you got banned under them, eh SS? Ah, but I have. I don't use the " ShadowPikachu " handle there - I only use that name on here. Hint : I'm right there on page 1.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It was more than " reporting ". All scripture is " God breathed " - Biblical writers were inspired by God. They didn't seem to be very inspired to elevate themselves, as almost any author does. To me, a good source for information is one that doesn't seek to promote itself.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>But, then again, any ' scripture ' you don't like isn't " TRUE " scripture. Most of the books you call ' scripture ' wasn't even written when 2 timoty was written. You reject much scripture.. yet you quote that. How ironic. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>What scripture have I indicated that I don't like? What books have I called scripture? What scripture have I rejected?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Let's see. Gospel of JUdas, Book of the Mormon, Gospel of Mary >, Tobias, Judith, 1st and second macabees, wisdom, baruch, the sophia of Jesus Christ,, the gospel of thomas, the gospel of truth. the gospel of phllip. Shall I continue? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yes, when you can show the threads and post numbers where I have referred to all this. There is good reason for the Bible to be arranged as is commonly accepted today. From " How Reliable Is The Bible ", by Judson Poling ; That's good enough for me. Now you don't have to guess at what I reject or accept concerning scripture, and why.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well, you know.. Judson was quite wrong about the ' new testament books '. Many were, but not all. And, you are rejecting many of the scriptures. despite the fact one of your scriptures ( 2 timothy ) says not to, and 2nd timothy was written between 100 and 150 C. E, which directly contradicts the claim of Judson Poling For that matter, the Gospel of john, 1st john and second john all were written after 90, and perhaps as late as 120. Judith and Baruch were written in the bc time frame, with Baruch being about 200 B.C. and Judith was written proably between 160 BC and 140 BC. So, your ' rational ' is based on misinfomration. And it means that you ' pick and choose ' what is ' scripture '.. It makes your quoting of 2 timothy totally irrelavant and hipocrytical. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>What is YOUR source? Where can one obtain a copy of the Bible that you believe is correct? Why are timelines so important - were they having a race?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What is YOUR source? Where can one obtain a copy of the Bible that you believe is correct? Why are timelines so important - were they having a race?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Well, I'm not sure that he claimed that it was " correct, " only that you pick and choose what you want to believe is " inspired scripture. " However, between 382 and 405, St. Jerome translated the Bible from the original Greek and Hebrew into Latin. That compliation was considered as " The Bible " from then until Protestant sects started throwing out parts that didn't quite fit their revised christian theology. You can still get copies of St. Jerome's Bible. It's known as the Vulgate. Check it out. You'll find that it contains several books that probably aren't in the Bible that you have declared to be inspired. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I think you're trying to re-write history. http://www.parbarwestward.org/frmApocrypha.htm I'm not the one doing the picking and choosing.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No. You are just a sheep following a " ministry " in it's efforts to justify the elimination of scripture that they find contrary to what they want god's word to say. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I'm a Luthuran. Martin Luther's works have been around a lot longer than Darwin's. ( Luther was mentioned in the link, in case you didn't read it. )<br><b> S2:3-  </b>What does the fact that Protestants ( including Lutherans ) edited the Bible when they wanted to change Christianity have to do with Darwin? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The " editing " has been going on with a lot more thought and a lot more people involved than the editing of worldviews by the sheep who follow the ministry of Darwin.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Again, what does Darwin have to do with it? And what does he have to do with " world view ", mine or anyone elses? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Darwinism is a basic foundation of those who question the Bible, who attack and question scriptural inspiration, who call Christians " sheep ", while never calling Darwinists ( themselves ) " sheep ". The word " worldview " bridges a gap that the word religion arguably doesn't. To say that you have no religion implies that you aren't a " sheep ", but the word worldview shows that we're all " sheep ".<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Jeez, marc. Wipe the foam off of your mouth.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>SP, why are you making a fool of yourself and defending a guy who already admitted he never rolled 5 six's in a row? Iangb has said he didn't do it so why the heck are you trying to prove he did? Have this discussion with yourself from here on, my time is too valuable to have such infantile arguments.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I must have missed that. Edit : I see now in his most recent post he clearly says this, so I stand corrected. I notice you made no comment on the other half of my post however...... The part about my own dice experience ( six ones in a row - those must be out of this world odds according to you ; and several in a row on a 20 sided dice ), and yes, they it was a single dice and done in a row. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Sure you did SP, and right in time for this debate. ;)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, this has occured in the time since I started playing D & D two and a half years ago. One incident ( the four ones on a D20 ) occured to my first character who died three sessions into the game. The three 20 s occured last summer with a centaur ( my favorite character thus far ). The six ones occured sometime in the last year. I am sorry that you do not seem to grasp the concept of probability and the fact that rolling the same number several times in a row is quite common and not anything close to " astronomical " as you claimed...... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You see, here's the problem SP, I'm not stupid. I even sat in on a few D & D games myself. So I know how many dice in a set. One 4 - sided die Four 6 - sided dice One 8 - sided die One 10 - sided die One percentile die One 12 - sided die One 20 - sided die Dungeons & Dragons Dice So your claim that you threw 6 ones in a row with a single die just defies belief since you rarely, if ever get an opportunity to throw six singles in a row on a 6 sided die in D & D. But you keep it up, you're just blowing smoke all over the place as you attempt to make throwing six rolls of the same number with one dice a common place event. I would just challenge any observer of this argument to take a dice while sitting around and throw it a couple of hundred times while keeping track of how many times the same number comes up in back to back succession.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>1 ) I don't have that D & D dice set. I got one in a short tube ( you can get from any gaming store ) which has one of each of those dice you just listed, not multiple. They are not made by Wizards Co. but are a generic gaming dice set made by Koplow Games ( " The NICE DICE Company " ) Right here : http://www.g2ch.com/dice-opaque-with...ers-p-516.html. Actually cheaper there ( without shipping ) than it was at my gaming store. No comment on the D20 I see........ 2 ) Apparently you aren't familiar with it, as there are NUMEROUS weapons that do only 1d6 damage - that means only one dice roll ( for example the club, the sickle, the short sword, the hand crossbow, etc. ), and also spells which do only 1d6 damage. So yes, each turn I did damage I rolled that 1d6 damage dice, and all those turns it came out as a 1.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>In fact, the " Scientific Method " originated from the idea that the Physical Universe operates on rational physical laws because the Creator did it in logical fashion. What did we have b4 that? " Dragons eating the moon during an eclipse '? Angry gods causing volcanoes to erupt? Apollo racing his fiery chariot across the sky every day?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And yet now we have returned to a faith-based view of the universe that relies on a Creator acting illogically ( read : deliberately fabricating a false version of reality, with ( for example ) light from the stars sped up in order to reach earth in time ) in order to work. I can't help but feel that some of us have moved backwards. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I agree. From what I have heard it was the " Church " that declared the earth to be flat. On the other hand - The Bible talks about the "... circle of the Earth "!!! [ Do not believe man is another adage attributed to the Bible. ] :) Not to mention that the "... the Earth hangeth on nothing ", in Job - - contrast that with the superstition of Atlas holding the earth on his back. [ Even as a child I remember wondering " What is Atlas standing on? :) ] Does anyone remember if Atlas's earth was flat or spherical? The picture is always spherical in modern times.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I can't remember. From what I can remember, however, ancient greek orrerys ( heliocentric models of the solar system ) have been found. A quick visit to wikipedia agrees with me. A slightly longer visit to my bookshelf confirms it with a name - ( link to wikipedia again because I'm to lazy too type the relevant quotes ). The Greeks knew. While faith may inspire scientific progress, blind faith - in this case the unfaltering assumption that your particular translation of the bible is the correct one - tends to stunt it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>There is no doubt that a lot of cultures retained a lot of knowledge about our physical universe and how things work. We have no real idea about the science of the anti-deluvian world - but we do know, they remembered how to build pyramids. More than one culture remembered how to handle stone in such a way. We still cannot duplicate how it was done. :) As far as stunting scientific progress with blind faith in bad ideas, I agree. How much progress was stunted with the idea of pangenesis? then later " mutations " providing new and useful genetic information? In my world - The Bible is true until it is proven wrong. Then it is no longer the Bible.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You do know that this has been directly observed, yes? Panda Shepherds are a good example... To use your analogy, and from a theistic evolutionist point of view - the bible provides the knowledge. The interpretations of that knowledge should provide wisdom - but only if those interpretations are correct. The bible is the bible is the bible - be it metaphorical or factual. It's the various interpretations thereof that are proved or disproved - and once one interpretation has been disproved, why cling to it? Your only reason is blind faith. The flat earth, geocentrism, and now creationism... all are based on incorrect interpretations, and all are observably false. To use a favourite quote ( paraphrased ) of mine - " The greatest triumph of science over religion was not evolution, or in education. It was in the 17th century, when churches started putting up lightning conductors ". <br><b>S1:4-  </b>This is another example of a mutation doing nothing more than scrambling the code that is already there. In this case : Color. No different than 6 fingers on and organism that already had the coding for 5 fingers. We can logically extrapolate that to mean the mutations will eventually evolve or even devolve into feathers or something that is genuinely new? I don't think so. Why are people still clinging to that? Go with pangenesis! It is just as valid yet more interesting. :) Give me just 1 hair follicle that produces a feather or scale as a result of natural mutation then I might consider it. Oh, I forgot, we can now splice genes into organisms and create a lot more hoaxes. Nevermind.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Good God ( NPI ). You guys have been hopelessly bound in speculation for the last 30 posts or so.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>True, but if it can be shown that a " better " universe could exist, then it would follow that no omnibenevolent, omnipotent god exists, as that god would have made the universe better than it is. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Okay, let me tell you as someone who by no means believes in Christianity that your point is just stupid. You simply don't know what God's intentions are. I design my own situations with a map editor for the computer game Operation Flashpoint. I can make the situations better any time I want, and I can make the situations more realistic... but I don't because I don't want to. You and UnkerPaulie have gone waaay beyond the core of the argument : what was God intending. Since you simply don't and can't know, it's utterly senseless to say the concept of God has been disproven by a universe He chose to create.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The key is that the bible claims that he loves everyone. A god without this characteristic would have no problem with the argument from evil. Similarly, the argument from evil does not refute the existance of a non-omnipotent god. I am trying to show that there is no god who has both of these characteristics ( omnibenevolence and omnipotence ). A god with both those characters ( in full ) would not have created a universe with any more unhappiness than absolutely necessary. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Who are you, as a non-omni [ anything ] yourself, one to judge what a necessary level of happiness is?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The ideal level of happiness would be one where unhappiness was all but nonexistant. That is not the case, currently.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>All science starts with a presupposition. Evolution presupposes naturalism. One has to start somewhere even if you are sure you are wrong. Science means to know. We owe the vast majority of modern scientific knowledge to people likw Pasteur and Boyles that started with the presupposition on a supernatural creator. A great deal of our knowledge of DNA came from Dr. Crick who believes we evolved from organisms from outer space. Science is science. To say that all scientist do not start with a presupposition is naive.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Well, the now late Dr Crick can have all the odd ideas he wants, but unless it is backed up by evidence, it isn't science. Yes, naturalism is a presupposition. On the other hand, it works. It makes predictions and it lets us do such things as make the very computer you are using. What kind of verifiable and repeatable predictions supernaturalism makes?? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I guess if you can say Cricks beliefs had anything to do with his science then the Wright Brothers invented powered flight because they believed in supernaturalism. Please explain what naturalistic process created computers? I was under the impression they were designed by humans. My mistake. The laws of nature are observed. It would make as much sense to say in the absense of light you predict it would be more difficult to see.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>DO you know what ' naturalism ' is? Naturalism is the concept that there are natural ( i.e. non-supernatural ) explainations for the way the universe works. The ' naturalistic ' way that computers were designed was through electronic theory, from the use of quantum mechanics, and from the assumtion that there are natural explainations for electricity and how material compenents are made. I suppose this will go right over your head though. When you type, I get this impression of a wheel spinning, but the hamster being dead. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You seem to have lots of visions. Computers were designed. That means they did not occur naturally.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>However, they were designed using naturalism as the methodology for the principles behind them. You seem to have a strong lack of vision. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>That makes no sense. What is naturalistic about computers?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Massive evasion of points, evidence, arguments via insult. Ray M.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That's it? Really? What points? What evidence? What insults? This is pointless, not to mention VERY frustrating. I tried to step back and calmly narrow the discussion and focus on some debatable points. You don't seem to be willing to do so, preferring to simply post sweeping opinions and run. I'm done here unless you actually show me a reason to believe otherwise. Waxy <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Feigning a phony honesty in order to insult the points, arguments, and evidence to not be evidence. The universal Darwinian tactic : Assert all evidence to not be evidence via continually " asking " for the evidence hoping an Admin will jump in and back this defeated tactic. Your previous post was an enraged flame trying very hard to appear calm. Get lost or debate in good faith - I don't suffer fools - creationist or Darwinian. Ray M.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Man, you must have a hard time living with yourself. :p You're asking me to debate in good faith. Your anger at being challenged and being asked to provide evidence is very revealing. :p Why the aversion? If you aren't willing to answer questions or provide proof of your assertions, how is it possible to have a debate in good faith? So - You propose the topic - please make it clear and concise, and I will attempt to debate it. Waxy <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Waxy : Why are you standing by saying nothing while one of your own is continuing to show how ignorant he is by asserting Isochron was not used at KBS Tuff? Ray M.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Quite simply because I don't know whether isochron dating was used or not. It becomes a " he said, she said " situation. ( no offense intened, it's just a phrase :p ) So as it stands - Pandion says that to the best of his knowledge it wasn't used and provided evidence to support his claim, you've said that it was used, but provided no evidence to support your claim. So, given that, it becomes a simple matter evidence supplied and the credibility of the person supplying it. Pandion has a record of honesty and has continually demonstrated an excellent knowledge of science, as of yet, you've demonstrated neither. Perphaps you would like to prove Pandion's ignorance for all to see by demostrating your understanding of isochron dating, and it's application to the KBS tuff. Waxy<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I partly agree with you, however, I am to stick with creationism, unless a scientist, historian, or somebody else finds an amazing discovery or something of the like that either makes evolution or creationism 100% true. By the way, if God, Allah, or any other " supreme beings " of the like were not considered to be " real ", and just figments of the imagination and such, than why does most of the entire world believe that they are real? Trust me... If God or any other supreme beings were just fantasy, figments of our imagination, or just a mere bedtime story to make people think good thoughts during harsh times, then why are there only very few Atheists compared to followers of supreme beings?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What sort of evidence would convert you? Not only is requiring " 100% proof " asinine, holding the action of the supernatural as the null hypothesis is fallaciously illogical ( i.e. God of the Gaps fallacy ). If the Christian God is real, why do two out of every three people reject it? See why this doesn't work? Your approach is another fallacy, argumentum ad populum ( appeal to the people ). If the planets really do revolve around the sun, how come Galileo was the only one who believed it? I guess the planets didn't revolve around the sun until that last person needed to make the majority switched his belief... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You can believe in what you want, and I'll believe in what I want. But there are facts to support each side of this issue.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Oh good. Then you'll be able to explain the human plantaris muscle with a creationist worldview. I look forward to your reply. While you're at it, tackle all the features mentioned here. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>As I said before, you can state all of the facts that you want, but I am never going to believe the evolution theory, unless the " puzzle " is completed and official...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So all this blustering and yet you admit that you cannot be convinced... unless something amazing happens. So I ask what it would take, and you say that you cannot be convinced... unless something amazing happens. You already believe stuff without " the ' puzzle ' [ being ] totally and officially complete. " In fact, you disbelieve things that you're told by your own religion are perfectly acceptable. In science, nothing is totally and officially complete ; we keep looking for answers to new questions, and for you to treat this as if it's a bad thing really goes to show that some people have their outlook on life bass-ackwards. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Put it this way, there's not enough time in the world to prove how right I am and how wrong you are and vice-versa. I'm giving up here and there, not because I lost the debate, but because this issue is wasting to much of my precious time and I could be doing something more constructive, as could you. We could argue about who's right for hours on end, but it's not going to get us anywhere.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>There's certainly not enough time in the world to prove yourself right ; that simply can't be done when one's position is wrong. Arguing would get somewhere if one would listen to the arguments. Instead, you are desperately clinging to comparing the steel Titanic with a gopher wood ark, arguing that genotypes and individual genetic codes are different, and insisting that you know more as a canard-swallowing 7th grader than degreed professionals. I generally dislike ripping into 7th graders, but you've earned the treatment you've gotten here today. Sadly for me, you're further supporting evidence that indoctrination starts young and is terribly hard to overcome. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I'm not saying that I know more then degreed professionals. But what goes around comes around... You're just an ignorant that failed to listen to a 7th grader...<br><b> S2:5-  </b>That's hilarious. I listen to 7th graders all day. You're one more, except you don't listen to the credentialed person trying to teach you. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>What are you, a teacher? If so, then shouldn't you be correcting papers or something?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Aren't you a student? Shouldn't you be studying or something? From what we've seen here, you certainly should be... You, on the other hand, have no idea what my workload is. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>I finished all of my 8 assignments in school.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>Then you have plenty of time to study biology. Hop to it. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Why would I need to study about biology when I already know the basics about it? I don't plan on majoring in biology or genetics in college, so what's the use to study beyond the basics? I am planning on majoring in either Law or Journalism.<br><b> S2:8-  </b>But you clearly don't know the basics. Two people very familiar with seeing waffling and BS on papers saw right through your blubbering about Neanderthal DNA. You have a plan already? You're in 7th grade. There's a wealth of knowledge for you to obtain before you should even be thinking about your college major. Maybe when you learn something about biology, you'll really like it. The Biblical version you've been taught is really quite boring. <br><b>S1:9-  </b>I was not taught the Biblical version of biology... And yes, I already know what I am going to major in, because of the fact that I really like writing poetry, such as haiku and free-verse, and Law just excites me with the courtroom suspense,. etc. I don't plan on becoming a biologist anytime soon. Science for some reason does not excite me, even though I get A's in Science.<br><b> S2:9-  </b>I'll venture a guess as to why science doesn't excite you : you don't know or understand enough of it. You think that those " problems " with BBT are actually problems, you think that there's no good evidence for evolution, and you think that there's evidence for creationism ( even though you can't provide any ). There's nothing wrong with not loving science, and there's nothing wrong with loving things other than science. But deciding by age 13 the direction you want your life to head is -- shall we say -- premature. <br><b>S1:10-  </b>Science, like biology, physics, chemistry, genetics, ecology, anthropology, and medicine don't really interest me. Although I spark some interest in psychology, because it would be very interesting to discover the mysteries of the human mind in one way or another.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Accipiter, all I think I come across as is right? did you mean to say, all I think is I come across as right?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yes I did. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You don't come across as right, most of what you say doesn't make sense. The parts that do make sense are often incorrect, I am reminded of the discussion about cosmology where you basically told us that you don't even possess an understanding of the simple laws of motion. You couldn't even pass a high school physics course so its understandable that no one buys into your idiotic arguments.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No comment. Would this be the one where you accused me of that but couldn't give any examples or explain why and proceeded to make statements which were so clearly wrong that you withdrew from the discussion completely? Bang, oh no not another brilliant argument! How could I possibly defeat that one Accipiter? It was a question to accipter, asking why he would want to know if I believe in God, i.e. what point was he going to try to make. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Examples? Here is an example, does the universe have a center? After you say yes, you are then no longer worth wasting time on. It's like you want to argue about mathematics but you never learned what numbers are.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well yes, that is impossible because we will always look for similarities to knowledge we already posses. If you had said it meant the ability to come to a conclusion absolutely independent of emotion I have done that and I know it is possible. I didn't think you did, you'll know if I think something is an insult because I will either ignore it, make a snide comment, or simply type ad hominem in bold face. Funny that two evolutionist can't even agree on what to believe. Yes Bang GOTCHA! stop wasting time :) Now that you have spent yourself on that little effort do you mind if I go back and look up the thing you said which actually was false and revealed you were an intellectual fraud? Or trying to argue about yogurt, without actually tasting milk.... <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The overwhelming preponderance of evidence says no, but you say yes? Who's on your side, god? Could show me other people who believe what you do? Links to information supporting your the universe has a center argument perhaps?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>One example? Oh no caught me without a collective! In my world truth does not flow from mere authority. Or should I say it does but authority is derived from reason. How many will it take :p I would not like to be compared to accipiter either, but in this case you are both trying to categorize me for purposes I am absolutely sure are irrelevant. I don't care for the spin but that is what happened. All evidence points to the fact that the universe is not static and therefore not eternal. This reconnects perfectly ( and annoyingly for many ) with the philosopher Aristotle's concept of a prime mover. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Just one. :)<br><b> S2:5-  </b>http://www.4forums.com/political/cre...tml#post402394 Rereading that thread I am once again shocked at your hypocrisy :) <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Your weird.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Accipiter at his best :<br><b>S1:1-  </b>except they were selected. there you go again making up rules that dont actually exist. body size like the example of the cuttlefish is a feature that can either be selected for or against, and it happened to be selected for in this case. neutrality is sometimes selected. if a neutral mutation arises, sometimes stabalizing selection tends to focus in on the population until that feature is inherited by everyone. this is just sometimes, it often doesnt work that way, but sometimes. in both the examples i gave, this appears to have happened.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>If it was selected for it was a net benefit. ( Yes same rule I supposedly made up ) What kind of sick college are you at where you get to escape the definition of terms? Through a third element you mean? Why would it stabilize to a neutral mutation? On what basis or standard would anything be selected at all? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>what do you mean third element? why would a neutral mutation increase in frequency? i dont know. but it does, and lots of animals have fully evolved neutral features.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well you do realize that a beneficial mutation cannot be selected by itself, it comes as a package with the rest of the chromosomes right? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>yes, and that can lead to negative traits. what im saying with the cuttlefish and the mole rat is there are no benefits that could produce these ' costs '. both cuttlefish size and mole rat's eyes are selectable traits, not just sidecars to beneficial traits. natural selection will either select for or against them, and in these cases, they were selected for for whatever reason.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>This attitude is the root of your problem when trying to understand IC. You think that you can take something that is conceptually impossible and prove it happened. Does it not enter your mind that if it is conceptually impossible there is another reason why it happened? How can you be sure that there was not a net benefit in the selection that caused blindness in moles or lack of camouflage in cuttlefish? What gives you the arrogance to think you can just contradict the definition of natural selection and claim it no longer selects for fitness but now for what ever the hell you need to? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Natural Selection - Biology Encyclopedia - body, examples, human, process, organisms, life, specific, energy, bacteria a common misconception is that natural selection means " survival of the fittest ". its displayed in all the TV programs about evolution. however, this is BS. reproductive success is the only thing that matters in natural selection, even if the modifications to do so are not beneficial to the survival of the organism. the term " fitness " that youve used deals only with reproductive success. i have not bypassed the definition of natural selection, ive used it correctly.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You can't escape. You know I have no misconception, answer for your mistake. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>conceptually impossible to have a neutral mutation selected for? it is not conceptually impossible.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Why do evolution sceptics insist that evolution must lead to an ' improvement ' to the species? Are all animals today superior to all the animals a million years ago... or should they be?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>" Survival of the fittest " right? or rather " death to the weak "? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Its not quite survival of the fittest.. is more ' advantage to the best adapted '. The same slight attribute from the mutated dna may in other enviroments be a liabilty and so death to the weak or better ' disadvantage to the less well adapted '.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So It still must be an improvement, even if it is based on its enviornment. ( it must also be a whole lot of luck ). <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Its an improvement if it increases you chances to pass on your dna but a liability if it doesnt. An individual who is a little bolder than the rest of the group may get a little more food or more of the right food..o r get the girl when other bashful males procrastinate..... he may get eaten by a predator because he was too bold.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So there is nothing that can be called an absolute improvement? Well that certainly drops the chances of evolution producing what we see here today even further. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>There does not need an ' absolute improvement ' as the enviroment changes all the time. An over extended ' improvement ' will eventually become a liability. It is because of this that we ARE here today. Also a mutated gene may give an advantage in future generations ie fat people today have a disadvantage because they are prone to illness. In other enviroments those people will live while the lithe fit people who cannot accumulate a nice fat layer will die. Hence survival of the ' fittest ' is not correct.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Oh, I see now! You are sure! I am now convinced... That is zero proof. And absolutely all variations are accounted for? Again you must look at how often ERVs are left. What I am trying to point out here is that the factors are not really stated and so people trust an article on the internet without solid proof. Such a thing certainly does not make common descent a fact. There existance is a fact, but their implication is not. Yes I was. I apologise if I did not make that clear. link? I never said that anything was a good comparison. I only said they used more than a single organ. There was a segment on the news very recently about scientists making things up to get paid.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Oh, certainly. All sorts of scientists " get paid " by creationist organizations to " make up " claims about evolution's falsity that uneducated people will fall for. Just as all sorts of scientists " get paid " by oil companies and oil industry groups to " make up " claims that global warming isn't happening, or has no connection to fossil fuels. That's what you meant, right? And of course, making money totally invalidates whatever they might say. This must be that " common sense " at work, I suppose. Apparently falling for ad hominem argumentation is part of it ; it's certainly a common mistake, if not exactly sensible. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>* sigh* Another tangent... When did I ever say such a thing? I said that money is motive for people to lie. Scientists are no exception. I was also talking about those who have been proven to have lied. Those you mentioned have not been proven so, no matter how good it would make you feel to think you are right.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>All of " creation science " is " made up. " I wouldn't call it lying, because I think that in most cases, they sincerely believe what they are saying. Rather, I'd call it delusional. ( I will make exceptions for Philip Johnson, who seems to revel in dirty lawyer tricks, and for any ID-creationist who denies that the designer s / he has in mind is the Judeo-Christian God. ) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So you say. Though all of your intense study on the subject? no. Congratulations on calling it things! So when do we get past the opinions?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>That's right! Through my study of the subject. I realize that you didn't see it happen, so according to your own standards for knowledge, my claim is false. Nonetheless, not everyone is an epistemological narcissist. Pot, meet kettle. You have not shown that any claim made by any evolutionary biologist is false. You have not shown that any argument made by any evolutionary biologist is invalid. Moreover, even if you had shown this in any individual case -- evolutionary biologists are human, of course, and in principle not less fallible than the rest of us -- that would be a far cry from showing a general problem with the claims or arguments of evolutionary biology. You want more than opinions and labels? Fine. Provide something more yourself. Until you do so, I am quite happy to meet you on the ground you yourself are staking out.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>We didn't evolve from apes.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Absolutely true. We share a common ancestor. We are part of a monophyletic clade with the apes. In fact there is some opinion that the chimps should be moved to the genus Homo. Some sort of vegetable then? The " Thing From Another World "? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It's a quote from " The Elephant Man " But I am in part biological, and part spiritual. Man is more than animal...<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Right. " The Thing From Another World. " * * A movie. The original staring James Arness ( Matt Dillon ) as the Thing. Not the rather poor remake of a few years ago with Curt Russell. The " Thing " resembled a bipedal hominid but was like a carrot at a tissue level. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Now if you came up with a bipedal carrot, I'd take a second look at evolution. I prefer Kurt Russell's version, if only for the FX<br><b> S2:3-  </b>That would be a bit silly, wouldn't it? If you mean a carrot native to earth, why would you decide to consider evolution when something was found that would shake evoltutionary theory to the foundations. Such a thing would be so far outside the phylogenetic tree constructed by observation of morphology and molecular biology that real doubt would be cast on the theory. But in this case, you would be willing to consider it. I guess that is why you cling to mythology. There is so much doubt and no evidence for creationism that you accept it as real. Bizarre!<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What new species was this " mouse " classified under? The same question for the new " fish " what species were they classified as?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The concept of ' species ' is a human construct. Plant and animal populations in the wild do not have to conform to it, and all degrees of separation from 0% to 100% can be found. I'm not sure why you've put " mouse " in quotes : the Faroe Islands Mouse is most certainly a mouse. By convention, it becomes a species in its own right, distinct from Mus musculus, when it is sufficiently reproductively isolated from Mus musculus for hybridisation between the two to fail to produce fertile offspring. In practice, this is not a clear-cut event, but quite long drawn out : commonly, hybrids first produce offspring of which one sex is fertile, the other sterile. This is when the Wallace Effect kicks in : individuals of either population that are pre-disposed to avoid hybridisation have a major reproductive advantage, and pre-zygotic isolation is quickly established. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>so mice are classified as mus musculus but within this classification there are further distinctions, ie mus musculus faeroensis? a follow-up question - is the " Wallace Effect " reversable? has there ever been an instance where, over time, animals which have grown reproductively incompatible become compatible again?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The house mouse is Mus musculus. There are several other species of Mus, and numerous other genera broadly described as ' mice '. The wood mouse, for example, is Apodemus sylvaticus. The Faroe Islands Mouse is a population that has diverged genetically from Mus musculus. When that divergence establishes reproductive isolation from the ancestral species, we will call it a species in its own right. But bear in mind that species are defined by humans, and the dividing lines are not clear-cut. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>two questions : Is mouse a species? It seems that species is being defined here as what I had thought of as sub-categories of species, ie a wood mouse. Also, you make defining a species sound very subjective. Is there not a good scientific definition that can be followed?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The generic word ' mouse ' - a small pointy-faced rodent - does not describe a species. If you captured males and females of the house mouse, the field mouse and the wood mouse, and put them together in all possible male / female combinations, you'd find house mice would mate only with house mice, field mice only with field mice, etc. The wood mouse is emphatically not a sub-category of some over-arching ' mouse ', but rather a genus and species in its own right. ( As a rough analogy, are humans a sub-category of ape? ) The only reliable scientific definition is the one I have given : a species is a population whose members are capable of mating to produce fertile offspring with each other, but not with other populations. In the real world, there are very many stages on the way to that condition. Look up South American Drosophila populations if in doubt. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>thanks for the clarification...<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You are right. In fact, I looked up Mendel in wikipedia and found out I was wrong on more than one account. Mendel didn't predate Darwin at all... they were contemporaries. ( High school biology is much too far away for me to try to make educated assertions on this subject. ) I need to read more on this before making further comments. So, back to my question... what scientific breakthroughs has evolution given us? 1. Medical testing on mice and monkeys.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>A question for you, ender _ krum. Does your above statement matter? Evolution is worthy knowledge alone as an explaination of the history of change in life on this planet. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I am asking this question because in the clip ( available here ), Dr. Larson was upset that a theory which has accomplished " all the breakthroughs in medicine and biotechnology... over the past hundred years " be put on the same level as non-scientific theories. He was the one that emphasized this... not me. I am merely trying to flush these advancements out.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I'm not convinced that Larson was attributing " all the breakthroughs in medicine and biotechnology... over the past hundred years " to evolution specifically but more too the scientific method as a whole. In this regard he is 100% correct to be upset that ID be given equal standing to a process that has built our understanding and world. See above, but I reiterate my initial point : why does it matter if evolution has contributed nothing to scientific advancement except an understanding of the nature of life over time and space? That is a question I would like you to answer. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>But he did... did you watch the video? Seriously? Then what is the difference between evolution and mystical creationism? This view also presents a " an understanding of the nature of life over time and space. " But again... this is how he differentiated evolution from the other two views presented. I did not make this question up, seriously, watch the clip.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Off course, but for your benefit I've transcribed the section that you are citing : So I don't think that it is unreasonable to assert that Dr Larson was refering to the scientific method as a whole as the source of the breakthoughs he gives. Perhaps if you could produce some of Larsons opinion on the matter at greater length rather than a few minutes of soundbites on a somewhat combative discussion show we might see if your interpretation is accurate. I think it isn't for the reasons I've given. " Mystical creationism " is based upon supersitition and belief / faith in that which has no supporting physical evidence. The scientific view is based upon observation, analysis and interpretation of the real and tangible. If you think the former is somehow more valid than the latter in this instance I'd be interested to hear why. See above. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>First, I guess we simply disagree about whether he was referring to evolution or science in general. I thought he was speaking about evolution, but I guess I could be wrong. To address your comments above, originally you said " why does it matter if evolution has contributed nothing to scientific advancement except an understanding of the nature of life over time and space? ". My point was that many worldviews give " an understanding of the nature of life over time and space, " many which are false. What is important is if evolution proves to be scientific... rather than simlpy a way of understanding life.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>An usual assertion to suggest that evolution needs to be proven to be scientific. Evolution is a product of the scientific process - I don't think there is a reasonable arguement against that - and as such is inherently scientific. So I think we confidently can set it apart from faith based interpretations of the development of life over time. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>An unusual prinicple, that a theory need not be proved. Anyways ( though the survival / sexual aspect of body hair is a facinating topic ), I am still curious as to whether speciation is reversable. Also, an example of speciation given above was field and house mice. Could one artificialy ensimenate between these groups? thx<br><b>S1:1-  </b>How is the observation that the fish are dead incorrect? The observations were never wrong, the conclusions drawn from it were. The theory of evolution mindset caused scientists to state that they were extinct. And guess what happened?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Technically it's not. The fish represented in the fossils are indeed extinct. The two species that exist today that are superficially similar differ in genetics representation and some anatomical functions. The Coelocanth of the fossils and the two species of Coelocanth are not the same. As much as you wish to pretend they are the same, you'd have to deny genetics as well as anatomical differences. It would be like saying that the shellfish in the lower part of the cliffs of Dover are the same as the ones half way up because they look similar. Are they? No. But that's what you're doing. And your point is? Just because one conclusion was wrong doesn't make the whole theory incorrect. I'd apply that to creationism but you will never defend your belief. At least here. The TOE did no such thing. The lack of existence for the species caused people to believe they they had died out. The same observation for dinosaurs. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The " I said so " argument is getting old. Simply saying that the two are completely different doesn't make it so. I never said a conclusion was wrong, I said a prediction was a massive failure. The scientists stated that it was extinct millions and millions of years ago based on the ToE mindset. A young earth model would not have come to the same conclusion.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Indeed. You really should stop using it. Indeed. You really should stop using it. Prior posts have pointed out that the fossil and modern fish are quite different. Furthermore, your own link states there are two species that branched from the original. Are you now going to deny the links you posted in support of your original argument? And what prediction was that? All the observation concluded that the species was extinct based on the fossil record and lack of any live specimens found. What did evolution predict? What mindset? Explain to me how evolution has any real relevance here. If I saw a fossil of small dinosaur, and then found no evidence for their existence now, how am I applying evolution? Barrel Scrapping in progress! Actually a YEC model would suggest they all died during the flood, and therefore would be extinct as well. Furthermore, YEC also results in all life in the ocean aside from some bacteria being killed from changes in salinity, reduction in oxygen content, blooming of bacteria from the massive releases of decomposition nutrients and a massive change in distribution of heat and nutrients due to salinity changes change how currents flow. There are some real big problems with YEC without even considering how it looks at current species. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You stated that the fish represented in the fossils are extinct. That is clearly false, despite some minor changes. my link agrees with me learn to read Because of the theory of evolution, scientists stated that they were extinct MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO. Wrong. You're assuming that God wouldn't be able to alter conditions so that fish can survive. Your argument = insanity<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Minor? Did you even look at the pictures presented earlier? ( I know the answer to that ) Hardly " minor. " The fish in the fossil is extinct. The fish which has divided into two different species we see today is not the same organisms. No, all it does it says is they found something they believed to be the same. Further on in your link it goes on to tell about the second finding of a similar but different species with different traits. People can read your links and see your claims are refuted by your own links. No, your link DOES NOT agree with you. I say so isn't working. How is the TOE relevant here? If you saw something that was in a fossil and didn't see it anywhere on the planet, would you think it would still be alive? I was wondering when we'd get around to that. It was only a matter of time before you resorted to the argument of : MAGIC! How is my argument insane when it cites your own links and doesn't rely on unprovable Gods that use magic?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The coelacanth, according to fossil records, and according to evolutionists, allegedly went extinct millions and millions of years ago. Until they were found alive. Coelacanth - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia As if this should be any surprise. The theory of evolution mindset once again contradicts observable science.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>There is just one thing however. The coelacanths found are different from those in the fossil record. Further, ALL evidence pointed to them being extinct, until we found other evidence, and we changed it. And, to top it off, the article says NEARLY extinct, not COMPLETELY. Although, this article was of course written after the coelocanths were re-discovered. Of course, this has absolutely nothing to do with the theory of evolution, which explains the mechanisms responsible for the change of allele frequencies in populations over time. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>They do not differ in any significant way. The living species today closely resemble the fossils. The prediction was made based on the mindset that everything evolved from a common ancestor over billions of years. Furthermore, it was based upon the fossil record, which is supposedly shows how everything evolved.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Yes they do. Modern Coelocanth : Modern Coelocanth No they don't. Fossil Coelocanth : Fossil Coelocanth No, it was based upon the fact we hadn't seen one, yet there were fossils of them. Then when we did see the descendants of the fossils and it got changed, that's how science works, when better data is found, the theories are changed. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>A model of a live fish and fossils of a fish are going to be significantly different under any circumstances. There was a gap in the fossil record, scientists looked it at it, and using the theory of evolution mindset, automatically assumed that it went extinct millions and millions of years ago. But of course, it was absolutely wrong. A prediction was made based on the theory of evolution and it was absolutely wrong. Simple.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes, and you know why? Because it evolved. No. They looked at the fossil records, and found fossils up until a certain point in time. After that no fossils were found, and nobody had seen the thing. Now, what conclusion can we draw from this? Or are you suggesting dinosaurs are also still alive, even though nobody's seen them? It has nothing to do with the mindset, and everything to do with the available data. Once better data became available, it was changed. Yes, but we had no way to tell until we found them again, now had we? The prediction was NOT made based on the theory of evolution, but on the fact that there were fossils up until a certain time, then there were no more fossils and nobody had seen the thing. What's so hard to understand here? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Apparently you think that fossils evolved into models.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No I don't. I know animals evolve, and this leads to morphological change. Thus, when a fossil is found, it will be different from a species living today. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>You replied " because it evolved " when I said " A model of a live fish and fossils of a fish are going to be significantly different under any circumstances. "<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Yes, the " it " in that sentence refers to the fish, not to the fossil.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Actually, birds are on top in your picture. Oops, there goes that rant.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So of course in your mind because the highest branch in the picture says birds, then that must mean that birds are a more sophisticated species than humans, right? Gee TQ, does that means that Birds are the APEX SPECIES on Earth, and are above humans in creativity, imagination and reason? Go figure. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Actually, that was your argument-that because humans are at the top of the " tree " that that demonstrates that they are the most sophisticated. So, if you want to get snotty about it, you're the one arguing birds are at the top of the heap.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Wrong again schnook. I don't need a picture to tell me that we humans are at the top of the heap as this planets apex creatures. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Oh, so you can point out where I argued that birds were the apex species? No? What a shock You're right, right now, humans are the apex species. BUT ( and I know you don't get this part ), we are not the most evolved. All extant species are equally as evolved.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Sure TQ, you are free to believe whatever floats your boat. Tell me though since I'm just dying to learn from you ; which lower life form which still eats its own dung is more evolved than us? And if you can tell me, at what point in human history did we decide it was no longer cool to do that?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>micro-evolution?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Sorry, I meant macroevolution. I have been discussing the impossibility of macroevolution occurring throughout this whole debate and have likened microevolution to rapid adaptation which does occur in nature. What hasn't occurred and never will is one species of animal evolving into another species which I did explain in the post in which I mistakingly used the term micro rather than macroevolution. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>There have been laboratory experiments with fruit flies which have produced the beginnings of speciation. Two populations of fruit fly    s were separated and kept in separate environments and fed different food. After many generations these fruit fly    s were brought together and it was found that only fly    s from the same environment would mate. Given enough time they would become separate species unable to mate.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Then why didn't you post a link to the actual experiment with evidence that macroevolution occurred? And by that I assume you mean that the fruit fly evolved into something other than a fruit fly, right? It was no longer a member of the same genus of creature at all, but had evolved into another type of fly other than a fruit fly? Is that what you're saying? In other words, Fruit flies are properly named Drosophila melanogaster, so their genus is Drosophila and their species is Drosophila melanogaster. There are a bunch of similar kinds of flies that are in different species, and so would have a different two-part name, but would all be Drosophila. Are you saying that after many generations one group of these fruit flies had evolved into a new and unique genus? If so, please produce evidence of this if you can. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Just do a search on, Diane Dodd Speciation<br><b> S2:3-  </b>What! You aren't interested enough to defend your own claim with evidence? Or do you already see the holes in your evidence? For example, doesn't your evidence show that all of the segregated fruit fly populations remained fruit flies at the end of the experiment? All be it flies which preferred other flies with the same diet? http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolib...experiment.gif Diane Dodd    s fruit fly experiment suggests that isolating populations in different environments ( e.g., with different food sources ) can lead to the beginning of reproductive isolation. These results are consistent with the idea that geographic isolation is an important step of some speciation events. Evidence for speciation As you can see, the result of this experiment promotes the idea of reproductive isolation. The rest of the claims are nothing more than the idea that isolation might lead to some speciation events. But nothing is concluded in absolute terms at all. This just confirms the giant leaps made with little or no actual evidence upon which they are based, at all. With that said, I must ask you, in what valid science is an " IDEA " conclusive evidence of any absolute fact at all? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Exactly. Bottom line, your type is not worth arguing with.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Of course we aren't. We are mythbusters who refuse to allow you to propagate your religions lies and misrepresentations regarding the origin of life on earth. And that's no fun for you, is it! Macroevolution is an unprovable myth which cannot be supported by science since it has never occurred either in nature or in the laboratory. PERIOD!<br><b>S1:1-  </b>THANK YOU! Let's look at his entire paragraph ; There's NO QUESTION he was referring to all men of God. You and electrolyte's dishonesty has just been laid bare. That, combined with all electrolyte's babbling, is making this thread even more fruitful than I thought it would be. P.S. ( Hi _ It's_Me ~ sics ~ me sometimes, just like you used to. Just thought I'd do it to Kenneth Miller once. He left out the word " it ". It wasn't much fun though - I don't need to do it to divert attention from the points being made ) Without Genesis, ( there's no Genesis with Kenneth Miller ) exactly where did original sin originate? They both concern actual event ( s ) of the past. There really is a connection. A rejection of Genesis also rejects much of the rest of the Bible, as vouched for by Jesus, the Prophets and the Apostles. Where would those moral lessons be? What's left of the Bible after theistic evolution gets done editing it?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>No, there's NO QUESTION that he was saying that all men of God promote those particular religious claims. And you wonder why I won't agree not to point out your lack of sixth grade reading comprehension skills... Rather than just stop there, I thought I'd take this opportunity to reveal still more of marc's hilarious " logic. " marc's entire tirade in this thread is meant in part to show that Miller is not a True Christian   . However, Miller is a mainstream Catholic. This would make Catholicism non-Christian, yet marc's argument here is that Catholic priests are clearly " men of [ the Christian ] God. " In order for marc's argument to hold water, Catholicism needs to be both Christian and non-Christian. Bravo, marc! <br><b>S1:2-  </b>How do you know that, because he says he is? Is that all the proof you need? I can't find proof that mainstream Catholics reject the book of Genesis. His book cover has several reviews from " science " interests, yet not a single one from a Catholic, or Catholic authority. Amazon.com s reviews of the book has not one review from a Catholic. I wonder what Catholics actually think of him. In order for your argument to hold water, you'd have to show me an authoritive Catholic source that endorses his book.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Let's take a look at the sentence again : He wasn't separating the idea because the idea is common. The label of " preacher " is not. As pandion points out, you almost have a point here. The question is whether or not Miller's beliefs are representative of those of mainstream Catholicism. Can you find damning inconsistencies between Miller's religious beliefs and mainstream Catholic beliefs? Let's presume that I sunk time into finding said source. You'd just yell loudly that whatever organization I found is really a secret bunch of evil, anti-Christian atheist sympathizers who can't be regarded as a reliable source, as evidenced by nothing but your whim. I only call you a liar without explanation when you've repeated the same lie so many times that my explaining it for the umpteenth time is a waste of time : you ignore it every time, and everyone else has read it already. You instead want a free pass to call Miller a liar merely because the technicalities of his beliefs differ from yours. Gee, how do you think you fellas came up with all those Protestant sects like yours anyway, marc? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>His only source of the idea was " preachers ". He wasn't separating preachers and priests either, because it was a common idea among both of them. Yes. http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05655a.htm You've come nowhere near showing Miller to be a " mainstream Catholic ", or showing a Catholic endorsement of his book. Accepted Catholic sources are easily recognized. " New Advent " is one of them. The atheistic belief that there was no fully formed first man is more than just a technicality. Technicalities, nothing nearly as drastic as some of Miller's harmony with atheism.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Your own words say it, but you still ignore it : the commonality is the idea, not the label. Shame on me for not telling you to use a source that wasn't from the early part of last century. Seriously, marc, is that the best you can do? The Catholic Encyclopedia is from the 1910 s. That's pathetic. Here's some updated information : Pope John Paul II, Message to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences on Evolution, 22 Oct 1996 Pope John Paul II, " Cosmology and Fundamental Physics, " 03 Oct 1981 Looks pretty Miller-like to me. See, now you can call JPII a phony, too, but that won't change the fact that he was the pope, and that Catholics hold the pope to be infallible. See above. Your source is damn near a century old. Modern Catholicism harmonizes with Miller's views. So now Catholics are atheists... Pathetic, marc, pathetic.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Is the " evidence " for creationism that strong? Native americans have similar stories about their cultural practices preventing some diseases, so what. It is ridiculously easy to find " evidence " to contradict you such as http://realmagick.com/articles/08/2108.html<br><b> S2:1-  </b>http://www.pytlik.com/observe/deliv...gnature-05.html These are actual advanced medical practices ( not just stories ) that can be found in a book written thousands of years ago. They can be verified to work. I would be willing to subject myself to them, and have subjected myself to very similar practices when I go to the doctor. The Bible claims that they came from God. I'm very serious : they are nothing short of a miracle. I have seen stanch evolutionists become Christians because of this very fact. The Bible ( in which they are found ) : 1 ) Is undoubtedly older than a 100 years, which is when we learned that these actually were advanced medical practices. 2 ) These practices were therefore in the Bible long before modern science helped us to understand what they were. 3 ) The Bible claims that they came from God. Now, if you want to continue believing evolution, you need to explain how the Jews got a hold of medical practices that had not been discovered until within the last 100 years or so. Can you? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I gave you link where similar things happened. By you own value system you should have actually bothered to read it. Native american stories are just as impressive and " work " just as well. The fact that they did not bother to put it in a book is irrelevant.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I have read it, and no, it does not prove my argument wrong. Please quote your article, because I haven't found what you keep refering to. Keep reading to see why. Btw, what is the credibility of your souce? I have quoted credible evidence, much more credible than " the occult library. " No, you misunderstand. Read this : http://www.pytlik.com/observe/delive...nature-05.html Now, tell me what it says, and I will believe that you have read it. Should be easy, right? :) ( Don't you people ever change? ) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Egyptians put poo in wounds and god told them not to. Just as impressive as certain native american cultural practices.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Thank you, but I just spent two hours refuting this idea, and you apparently have not read, or do not care about my refutation    since you merely repeated yourself. I don't know. He might have, but, unfortunately, if it is in scripture, we have not yet found it, and even if we did, we would probably not understand that it actually was a cure for cancer. Remember, God wasn't trying to give us a science book, but was giving his law to the Israelites. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Do you like making people angry? It really does seem to me that you are trying to annoy me which I find odd. You accused me of not reading a link and challenged me to tell me what the link says. I did read the link before your accusation and I have no idea what this two hour refutation you are talking about.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Looks like " The Skeptic " has run away too. What is it with modern day creationists, they just have no staying power :(<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I wonder what makes people rip on another persons belief when it doesnt agree with their own? Where does this behaviour stem from? Were we like this from the beginning? Or is this a learned behaviour? There are as many variations on creationism as there are on evolution, one for every persons point of view. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Lots of things : anger, fear, fun, boredom, intelectual challenge etc. It is likey a bi-product of our evolving social cohesive behaviour. There are a few creation websites out there that affect the opinions of most creationists we see coming through here. There are actually very few variations on creationism ( at least here ).<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I am a creationist, but I believe that a literal interpretation of the bible would be a bunch of hogwash. I believe that there was a big bang. I believe that life evolved over millions of years, and I believe that there is life elsewhere in the universe. But I also believe that God had a hand in the big bang, and the evolution of the universe wich includes biological evolution. I use this comparison a lot, but a computer is a complex piece of equipment wich would not exist without intelligent design. the computer is being refined by its creators even today and becomming more complex along the way. I am confident in assuming that the computer is evolving as a lifeform does. It cannot evolve without its creators help though, and would never have existed in the first place without a creator. Then you take a look at a lifeform and how complex the design of even the simplest ones are. I think that there is a designer, and he / she is constantly refining his / her design. And I think that if you were to see the individual views of the creationists, instead of lumping everyone that believes there is a supreme being into one group, none of them would be identical. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>This is the same as you claiming to be an American. Yes you live in North America so could call youerself an American. But the term means a " citizen of the USA 2 to most people, so your use of the term would be confusing. Likewise, the term " creationist " means ( to most that get involved in the debate ) a person who takes the bible literally and believes that their god knocked the world up in seven days some 6,000 years ago. Then your confidence is misguided. There is no comparison between biological evolution and the evolution of computers : they are chalk and cheese. The real killer difference is that computer design borrows ideas from other " unrelated " computers, which simply doesn't heppen in nature. There may be a creator and it may well influence the evolution of life. It does so through the use of evolution though, not " intelligent design ".<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I live in north america, and in no way do I consider myself to be an american, I AM CANADIAN and I am proud of that fact. And yes I do believe that God influences the evolution of life. That is what I am getting at. And my comparison with computers was used as an example of a designer having a hand in the evolution of a creature. The first computers were simple, yet enormous. Now they are complex and compact, kind of like prehistoric creatures, and todays creatures. Not that a computer could be considered a creature. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Then you are not a creationist by any normal use of the word. If life was designed, it was designed using evolution, not classical " building block " design. Computers are designed using classical " building block " design. Your " size " comparison also doesn't work : the largest living animal that has ever lived is the Blue Whale. It is still alive today. There have been some experiments using evolution methods to design electronic circuits for example. They, just like life, bear no resemblance to classically designed objects. They are like life : they look deceptively simple yet we generally do not have a clue how they really work.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I believe in an event of creation, and believe there is a god. Therefore I believe in creation. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Indeed, so you say. But you are not a creationist in the normal use of the word.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I know, to atheists, the most unpleasant and unwelcome thing imaginable is for evidence to be presented to heave poor old Chuck out the window. That contradicts their beliefs. Linimus found this and its associated statements to be profound. They are in fact, just more atheist talking points - nothing more. This belief is as irreplaceable to atheists as belief in the Bible is irreplaceable to SS. " Emotion and self worth " - comparable in all beliefs.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This belief once more being darwinian evolution. Well not exactly my friend. There were atheists long before Darwin you realize. Its perfectly possible to be an atheist and not even be aware of Darwins work since atheism only requires that one not believe in Gods. One can reach that belief easily without any knowledge or invocation of evolutionary theory at all. They are not linked in that way. As to SS you are also incorrect. We do not know whether or not he believes in the bible. He could well be atheist or non-Christian / Jewish / Islamic for all we know. He argues from an entirely different base. And of course he could be the Pope for all we know. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>But any atheist, any person, will want to have some backing for their beliefs. The atheists that existed before Darwin didn't have anything. ( simple animal like illiteracy maybe ) They're practically non existant today, as far as debate is concerned. You'd be very suprised how easily one actual Christian can recognize another one.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Tsk tsk my friend do you not know that Darwin published in 1850 and there were many many convinced atheists in say 1840, and in the 1700 s ( for example Thomas Paine whose name you may recognize - read The Age of Reason ). They were convinced on the basis of many many empirical observations. And of course science was a well organized enterprise before Darwin and it did not admit of non-material explanations well before his time! And its worth noting that Paley predated Darwin what would he argue against if there were only " illiterate " atheists. Sorry but atheism was present in the ancient civilizations right down to the present date and Darwin was not the basis of such beliefs - it could not have been. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Well, those are good points. But if there were " many many empirical observations " against religion before Darwin, why aren't they more prominent in atheist talking points today? Can you name any of them? I've never heard of any of them. Why is Darwinism and all its various paths practically all todays atheists refer to when backing up their beliefs? No, the secret is how quickly and easily we draw the ire of atheists and evolutionists. If you    re being serious, I    d like you to explain that one. You believe in some of the teachings of Christ, and not much of the rest of the Bible, is that it? I think Kenneth Miller is that way, and some other posters here on 4 foru ms. But from what basics I know about the teachings of Christ and the characteristics of God, I have a hard time becoming convinced of any sincerity from them.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Surely you are aware that after the death of Christ and the dispersal of the disciples to foreign parts and during the rise of the Church in rome the powers that be found themselves adding theological element after theological element to the original unadulterated teachings of Christ. To the point that what was a workable ethical philosophy became so larded with OT concepts and with Roman religious concepts ( and organizational structure ) that one could hardly find the original teachings under the overlays of theology and authoritarian structure. Christian athesists discard the theological and structural overlays and go back to the actual original philosophical teachings which were atheist in their content. Christian atheists get back to the basics, the true teachings. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So the original teachings of Christ were atheist in their content? Links??<br><b>S1:1-  </b>If ' INtelligent design ' is taught in a philophy class, fine. If it is taught in a religious class, fine. > But ID is not science. It does not belong in a science class. Do you teach math in a phy ed class? Do you teach cooking in the math class?? No. So you shouldn't teach ID in a science class.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>But, where to start? Philosophy is fine, but faith is paramount.. right? At what point do we attempt ( as Christians ) to make the things of God logical? How much faith are we willing to put at risk for the sake of ID, in-depth, studies? okay. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Faith might be paramont in a religious class, but not in the public schools. There is this little thing known as the ' seperation of church and state '. I am sure you won't want Islam to be taught as the truth in public schools. I am sure you don't want the Hindu religion creation myth taught as truth in the public schools. If you want ' faith ' in the schools, why, then private schools are the answer for you.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Schools on a national level have already stated where they think religion needs to be - and I won't contest it. You should have left out that " Separation " catch phrase, trebor. It doesn't mean, and never will, the separation of God and state. Faith is already in Sunday school, as Waxy pointed out. There have been improvements in that area - as far as teachers and teaching materials are concerned - and are improving each year. There are many school teachers, that know how to teach that are now offering their services in church. We need to keep it that way. And, FWIW, we don't want to end up like those Brits, as johnhanks referred to - selling chalk, thinking that it's cheese... :) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>As a matter of fact, it does. The god concept is religionous, so the state cna not promote one concept of god over another.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I will offer nothing but this : Statistically, the United States still holds true to the belief that there is one God and that He is in control. Despite all the political rhetoric, all the hiding behind the Bible, all the false prophesies, all the publicized-God-hating, people in general still believe God is sovereign.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Im still waiting to find the text book that will show me how to get perfect order out of nothing explodeing!. What we need is theory to revolve around facts not facts to revolve around theory, other wise all we are ever gonna be are unanchored ships on stormy seas!..<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why? Since there is no " perfect order ", just chaos, what use would such a book be? We have them. We have chaos theory, plate techtonics theory, evolutionary theory etc etc. What happened see was that people stopped trying to fit reality to their bible and instead looked at the world objectively and science, along with its theories based on facts, was born... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Firstly its the roots to man kind and excistence we are talking about and all you have given me here is theories. Where are the facts, its the facts that need to come first then the theories to support them, and people it is fact that evolution starts and ends as a theory.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>And here ladies and gentlemen we have the evidence of why I am justified in calling the likes of " stormboy " an idiot. The guy tries to discuss science when he is so utterly lacking in basic science that he thinks that the earth spins to " keep [ s ] the oceans from falling off towards the sun "... stormboy, there is a thing called gravity : it is what " keep [ s ] the oceans from falling off towards the sun ". Now please go away and get an education, then when you have even the faintest idea of what you are talking about ( which you currently do not ), come back and attempt to debate. It will be for your own good as you are just making yourself look a prat by staying here. Those theories are based upon those facts that you ask for. Get yourself an education and learn those facts. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>A simple school experiment i learnt when i was in 2nd grade at school. Take a bucket and fill it half way up with water then begin to swing the bucket around in the air, tell me what do you have? Its a mighty statement to call a theory like evolution a fact.. You may think you have the facts to back up the theory of evolution, when in actuall fact, without time these facts just turn into kids nusery rimes, just like when the princess kissed a frog to create a prince. So here we are again, without time, evolution is exposed as a joke, and friends when it comes to time, there needs to be a begining and a end, outside of this were do we end up?, cmon people altogether now,!! One more eg of time : When does the day start?, I hope we all got that question right. Now for the next question when does the day finish?, now if one does not believe in creation, then this little pattern will take us way back to the so called big nothing explodeing! It doesant get any more point blank then that!!!. The next question i want to here from you guys is, " were is the evidence that supports the events in the bible? "..<br><b> S2:3-  </b>00:00? Dawn? When you wake up? Just like with ( probably ) every other " start ", there is always an earlier ( or later ) point that can also be seen as the start. So we can go all the way back to the big bang, have we reached the start of all beginnings, or just another false dawn? I'd suggest we stick with questions more of your level, like " what is 1 + 1? " and " what is your name? ". We don't want to confuse you by asking " difficult " questions yet...<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Monty, You appeared to have got a little carried away and forgot to answer the one thing I was interested in knowing : Did you mean to claim that chimps were not apes? Any chance of answering it now please?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Are you confused? You said the posts were about apes, then mentioned chimps yourself. Then questioned why I'd post what I did, and when I stated that the connection was primates, you pretended that I might have thought something else. I never said that chimps were not apes, and thus you saying that my post was about apes, and asking what relevence was the post to the title, is still a mystery... it seems you are confused. What I said is that if you accept chimps are apes, then what problem do you have with a post on apes ( according to you ) on a thread title mentioning monkeys. Please explain :) Here's a ( non-biological ) source that might clear things up for you... ape P Pronunciation Key ( p ) n. Any of various large, tailless Old World primates of the family Pongidae, including the chimpanzee, gorilla, gibbon, and orangutan. A monkey. http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=ape <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Very confused. So we have established that you accept that chimps are apes. But you seem to be now saying that chimps are monkeys too. Is this correct, or are you simply incapable of expressing yourself clearly?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, as I said at the very beginning, when you asked... I said the link was ' primates '. You said that this was some kind of cover-up... based on your own gut feeling and / or set-theory. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I feel myself getting ever more confused over your position. You quoted the following definition ( my emphasis ) : So you don't think that chimps are monkeys, but you accept that chimps are apes. You then quote a source that claims apes are monkeys. Do you therefore disagree with this definition? If so why did you post it? If you do agree with it, why did you claim that you don't think chimps are monkeys?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I stated the connection was primates. Your attempt to mine for something of substance to back up your theory that I am ' confused ' is quite sad. You were answered in the first post ; you rejected that based on a feeling. You seem determined to keep on, although I answered you. To what end? Has this something to do with your non-sequitur ' set theory ' statement. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Monty, please answer my question. If you didn't understand the question, please seek clarification. I'll repeat it for you with slightly different phrasing : Do you agree or disagree with the definition you posted? If you disagree, why did you post it? If you do agree with it, why did you claim that you don't think chimps are monkeys? To help you, here are two " non-sequitur " set diagrams. Can you tell me which you think is the correct one : http://www.odiumempire.com/set1.png http://www.odiumempire.com/set2.png<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I would of been nice if the science teachers at school had of taught me evolution from that view point " we dont know ", instead of " yes we do know " back in the day, it would of shortened the length of time for me to come to know my saviour and king Jesus!..<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I think it's safe to say that you have no basis for saying evolution is wrong and instead just spout religious spam. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I may have no basis to say that evolution is wrong, but i think its safe to say this Clive lad that is saying we should accept the fact that " we dont know " just may..<br><b> S2:2-  </b>We do not know for certain because we have not observed it. All the evidence point to it happening, we simply have not observed it. That is why it remains a theory. However, speciation has been observed and that alone kills the Creationist theory of unchanging animals. Evolution is speciation on a grander scale and scope. Let me know if you don't know what speciation is ;) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Now you are stateing an absalute when you say that a virus becomeing amune to a drug, is the evidence you need to kill off the creationists knowledge of an unchangeing animal. See as for speciation it can only ever remain within a species and without time, the grander scale does not excist, so again all that we are left with is theory. What i want to know is, were you find the room to state an absalute, after starting off your paragraph with the words " we dont know for certain ". See its only speciation on the grander scale that is enough to kill off the knowledge of unchangeing animals, so i think this is the absalute your looking for.. And until you can come up with some solid archeological evidence to support the grander scale, it will only remain a theory.., and never an absalute. The theory of evolution in its own is not a bad thing, its only that when it is presented to our schools and the general public as being fact, that it does to become a problem. Evolution is and always will be just that, theory, and it is only in this way should it be presented<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Wow, you butchered that. " without time, the grander scale does not excist [ sic ] "? Well, duh. Without time, speciation does not exist either. If you accept speciation you pretty much have to accept that Evolution is at least a strong possibility. Evolution is speciation that is happening over a large amount of time, where species change little by little ( which you already accept with speciation ) to the point where they no longer can interbreed with their previous " branch ". Then they are called a new species. Viruses are a bad example because they transcribe RNA - > DNA instead of DNA - > RNA It does kill of the " knowledge of unchangeing [ sic ] animals ". If you accept speciation, you accept that species can change to adapt to their environment. There is nothing, at that point, to challenge that a species will continue to change in the manner Darwin postulates. Agreed, that is why it is the Theory of Evolution. We have not observed it happening. It is presented in textbooks as the Theory of Evolution. It is taught as the best explanation that we have for our existence. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I believe science is a great tool to help us understand that which is observable in the now ( The law of gravity, SPECIATION, medicine and so on ), however to use science to observe that which is not observable like the long periods of time that helps to support the theory of evolution, and i love to stress that word " theory! " would be like trieing to use a spanner to fix a watch.. See i know the evolutionists like to use the word science when it comes to evolution, but the question needs to be asked when it comes down to the period of time that it takes for evolution to work, is it science or is it faith?. Because of science, we know gravity is a fact, because of science we know that a heart transplant is a fact, because of science we know that weather forcasting is a fact, so is it because of science we know that evolution is a fact. This is a little indicator on how when it comes to the time it takes for evolution to work, science needs to take a step of faith!<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Care to make a better analogy? Spanner to watch is a little out there. Science describes what is not observable all of the time. Cosmic strings to atoms to EM radiation, we cannot observe them directly and instead infer that they exist through evidence. You love stressing the word theory? I haven't really disagreed that Evolution is a theory. " evolutionists " ( in the real world we call them scientists ) use the word science because that is the process they use to infer that Evolution happens. The rest of your post is filler. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>All jargen aside the bottom line is that science has no place when it comes to observing the time it takes for the evolution theory to work!!!!!. evolution purely has to place its faith!, in that time!!!! Tell me cosmic strings to atoms to Em radiation, is all this jargen factual, if it is the case, why is evolution only a theory and not fact, you have no place to use that line of reasoning to support the use of science with the period of time it takes for evolution to work!<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Gday Zachvac, I think it is great that you will be takeing on biology next semester, i encourage you to go in with an open mind and the confidence in yourself to ask all the right questions. Now with the rats becomeing stronger and smarter, it is great evidence for speciation. Just as we know that the earth continents are shifting, we do know there is speciation within species, these are facts. The problem is however, who is to say that speciation is all there has ever been since the beginning of time. To say speciation is factual evidance for evolution is weak, because all we know of speciation is that there can be changes within a species but there is no evidance that speciation on its own is evidance for an animal to change into a completely differant animal, this is why the fact can only be used to support a theory and not evolution as fact. It is true that there is alot of facts that they use to try and support the whole evolution theory, its just that these facts on there own have no grounds to support evoulution as being fact, until they can come up with some strong archaeologcial evidence, evolution will only ever remain a theory..<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Actually the skeletons of members of the whale family are good evidence of animals changing over time into completely different animals. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Show me were i can find this evidance and i will chase it up then weigh it up!<br><b> S2:2-  </b>http://darla.neoucom.edu/DEPTS/ANAT/whaleorigins.htm <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Thanx sinjin, I appreciate you chaseing up what you believe to be evidance, however all you have provided is the skeletal remains of a land creature, the rest is all theory to explain how these things become whales.. I also want you to know that i believe that i am not blind to the logic of the theory. It is very interesting how a whale does breath oxygen and feed its young with its milk, all we need to do now is prove that this just hasent been the case since the time the whales were created. What would have been real impressive is if that land creature had the remains of fins!.. What you have nailed though, that this is a perfect example as evolution being presented as fact not theory. quote " scientists have long known that Cetaceans ( whales, dolphins & porpoises ) descend from four footed land mammals. " end quote. Now if this is the case then evolution is no longer a theory, it has become fact!. Again, there is nothing wrong with the evolution theory, aslong as it is presented as that, theory!. cheers sinjin Stormy<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Scientists " know " about whales evolving from land animals as opposed to sea creatures. They already assume that all other scientists accept evolution as the process. Why would God create whales with vestiges of hind legs or bones for non-existent fingers / claws?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>obviously I'm referring to the Darwinists who are the mainstream writers who have shaped and molded society's belief system in regards to evolution. My statement was directed to those whose books the public actually reads.... which is why I asked you for a " high-profile " neo-darwinist / materiali st. I could care less about any tom, dick or joe who writes a book nobody in the real world cares about or has read. here's my challenge again : name me 1 high-profile materialist / neo-darwinist book that talks about the mind as a biological alternative to RMNS.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>For what earthly reason would an evolutionist or NDS student refer to MIND as a component of evolution of say bacteria. Bacteria lack minds. Worms lack minds, Snails lack minds. If mind drives evolution then it would have to preceed evolutionary processes ( cause comes before effect ya know ) since it does not it can be ruled out on first principles alone. At least for any species which evolved before minds evolved. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>an organism obviously does not necessarily need a brain to have a mind. How do plants, for example, " know " to drop more seeds when they are spaced far apart than they do when they're crowded?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Phytochrome pigments. Not mind. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochrome <br><b>S1:3-  </b>how does it know?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It does not know. It simply responds with a tropism. Plants know nothing, indeed can KNOW nothing. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>well the plant is evidently aware that there aren't too many other plants around when it decides to make / drop more seeds. From where does this awareness originate?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Nope its not evident that plants are aware. Not in the sense which applies to animals. They have systems which respond to light, moisture, gravity, etc to produce tropisms. Fell free to ask any plant you believe has a mind to explain it to you some day. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Nope its not evident that plants are aware prove it scientifically. Your statement is simply a guess. You have no idea. They have systems which respond to light, moisture, gravity, etc to produce tropisms yea they have all kinds of systems to respond to all kinds of stimuli, including some sort of awareness that enables them to determine how many seeds to generate and drop. I'm asking from where does this awareness originate... what senses the environment?.. and how? Mechanism?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It's always interesting to look at websites likewww.songofgenesis.org and and try to figure out if they are some person or groups sincere belief, or if they are simply an atheist trick.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why do you believe that atheists are trying to trick you? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not necessarily me personally, but anyone who will listen. If they can reduce the book of Genesis to metaphor or poetry, it goes a long way to getting religious morality and tradition completely out of their way, leaving them free to be gods themselves    to    grow in political and economic stature, gaining [ their ] own set of constitutional    rights    to both research and funding, arrogating to [ themselves ] alone the power to make morally troublesome decisions.    ( Winnick )<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Do you trust your doctor, he is trained in science, is he out to get you too? I assure you there is no conspiracy of science out to destroy you or your most cherished beliefs, that    s a ridiculous notion. If anything religion is distorting itself by inspiring that kind of crazy thinking. When people say stuff like that they come across as total nut cases. What if I said to you that your religion is a massive clandestine plot against me and my most cherished beliefs, would that give me more credibility in your eyes? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Nothing to do with what I was saying, but you already knew that. I'm talking about political activism in organized groups. Me and my most cherished beliefs is not what I'm talking about. All the recent historical facts put fourth by Winnick, combine perfectly with what ID proponent Phillip Johnson puts into words so well ; " Whenever the " separate realms " logic surfaces [ science = facts, religion = faith ] you can be sure that the wording implies that there is a ruling realm ( founded on reality ) and a subordinate realm ( founded on illusions which must be retained for the time being ). Retained, that is, merely for the sake of public relations. The scientific elites know they must not press the anti-religious implications of scientific naturalism too explicitly, lest the natives grow restless and rebel. But by employing the fact / value distinction, they can reassure the public of their great respect for religion, while at the same time reducing it to noncognitive, subjective experience that need not be taken seriously in the public realm. " It would tell me that you may have read several of the books I listed in post #16 - that seems to be what they're saying. Johnson's above quote was written before most of those books were written. Maybe times are changing concerning scientific respect for religion?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>This guy your talking about has all the credibility of someone who claims to have been abducted by aliens. You defense is no defense at all. It is based on flaky peoples interpretation of myth. You religious people need to realize that quoting bias whack jobs and passages from you book of fairytales is in no way an adequate defense.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Seriously? That's your reasoning? By such logic, swimming with sharks means that humans always have coexisted with sharks, including the ancient ones that preceded the dinosaurs. By such logic, since humans can coexist with insects, we must have been around during the carboniferous period.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Another lie. The sentence you've quoted never made any such argument. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Ah, you've engaged in the grammarian nitpick function of debate. Sad, but predictable. Obviously, I was discussing the entire article, which is making that argument. It is generally bad form to quote an entire post when it reaches such length.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The article as a whole never made that argument either. Lie number.... oh I can't keep track anymore, let's just call it 40. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Okay Yankee Fan. Keep pretending that it doesn't. Well, if you never read the article, you wouldn't be pretending as that would be an argument from position of ignorance.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I'm a twins fan, I've always hated big market teams buying their way into the playoffs. You're arguing out of sheer ignorance. You're just spewing anything out just so you don't have to focus on the main subject, right? You remind me of a delusional person who said that McCain will still win the election on the morning of Nov 4 even as poll after poll shows Obama winning 350 + electoral votes.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Seriously? That's your reasoning? By such logic, swimming with sharks means that humans always have coexisted with sharks, including the ancient ones that preceded the dinosaurs. By such logic, since humans can coexist with insects, we must have been around during the carboniferous period.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Er, no. That is AnswersinGenesis ' reasoning. Are you having difficulties reading? It seems so, as you are unable to distinguish between what a poster says and what an organization they are quoting says. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Generally, when someone posts an article without a disclaimer, they agree with the findings and the reasoning of the article provided. Besides, your statement does not change the fact that the reasoning provided is foolish.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Since when? So if I were to post a news article where someone says that pedophilia should be legalized, then it means I agree with them? I thought this was a discussion board. That means we, you know, DISCUSS THINGS. Now, if I had said " Here is AiG's article and I couldn't agree with them more ", then you would have an argument. As I did not, you don't. Now, do you retract your false statement that what you quoted was my reasoning? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Since always? Well, if you said " Look what I found, isn't that disgusting? " Or " Here's something truly controversial, what do you guys think " or basically anything that shows you were posting it merely for a discussion and that you weren't supporting its findings. Disclaimers are great things. You should try them. And Not really. If someone posts an article without a disclaimer, do you think that they don't support that article's findings? Fine, it's not your reasoning. That doesn't make the reasoning not defunct though.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well, sorry I did not bow to your whims and read your mind to know that you require a disclaimer to realize that the words of a quoted article are not the words of the person that posted them. No, not really. If they do not specify in that post I may ask them if they agree with it, but typically don't even do that but rather comment on the actual article. I CERTAINLY don't claim that the words of the article are the words of the poster. That would be retarded. That's nice. So we agree you lied. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You fail to realize that when posting in such a fashion, you assume the author and the reasoning and the beliefs. By your logic, people have no basis for things they post. You posted without a disclaimer. Therefore you take into the statements made by that article. You even agreed that you wouldn't assume that a poster doesn't disagree. lol. I find it amusing how you can't win normally you assume Yankee fan's tactics of nitpick. The article you posted is stupid and the reasoning it suggests results in pretty outlandish ideas.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>[ B] In other words Intelligent Designers are simply put, Creationists who were upset because the Government said teaching creation was not Science so Creation was removed from school studies. A group of Creationists came up with " intelligent design " and tried to pass it off as science in an attempt to get " GOD " put back into Public Schools. Their Effort has failed in Courts all around the Country. ID'ers are Creationists with a cool new name.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The fact remains that current subscribers of ID do not have the same basic premise as most Creationists. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>There is no Evidence to support this as a fact. The fact is that ID'ers are Creationists. If " GOD " or a Creator is involved then it's Creation.. ID'ers have been attempting for years to distance themselves from Creationism but their beliefs have remained the same. That is the facts...<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If you are saying intelligent design necessitates belief in God, then you have a warped sense of reason. Saying something was intelligently designed doesn't require belief in the supernatural. You are, of course making another common fallacy here, similar to the Nazi Fallacy. You are attempting to argue not on the substance of the matter, but instead to connect your opponent with a group that is easier to dismiss. Guilt by association. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I'm afraid your sense of reason is the one that is warped.. Intelligent design Does rely on the Premise that there is an Intelligent Designer which would in fact be Creation. No one is arguing that that Intelligent Designer has to be the Biblical God. There are other Religious people who also believe " THEIR " Deity created Life.. They all fall under Creationists.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I don't really know. What I can be sure of however, is that it did not come about by chance in the alotted time. ( 4 Billion years ) Why IDers want to prove ID is irrelevant, its the proof itself that matters. Or evolution could have been guided by the ID entity, if so, then the term creation would only apply loosly. You want to argue against a creationist. The basic premise is different, and you can't handle that. Lets see : Xcaliber : Your a creationist!!! I win. Person : No I'm not. Xcaliber : I don't believe anything you say, your still a creationist!! I win. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Then it wouldn't be Evolution now would it. Simple Fact of Life.. Intelligent Design is just an umbrella term that creationists use to mask the fact that they believe in the invisible creator. In other words, Intelligent design IS Creationism.. Can't help it if the truth hurts.. If that's how you see it, I won't argue it with you.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>From my experience most people that believe in God don't care what other people think. Take Crick, one of the pioneers in DNA, he was a firm opponent of Young Earth Creationist, yet thought DNA could never evolve in 4 billion years.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>My assertion is not that they could be involved with intelligent design. creationism you imbecile. My assertion is that intelligent design could be accommodated withinn Buddism by karma and samsara... way way way over your head lol Yes I am frusterated.. I dont suffer fools like you gladly. The trouble is that there are more XXXXXX like you than cockroaches<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And you call me the Imbecile... I point you to your own words idiot... Found here in case you have trouble remembering.. http://www.4forums.com/political/cre...tml#post419187 So if ID is a theological assumption, ( which btw I have maintained throughout this discussion ), then how could it be involved in a non-theological religion?.. As your buddy EZ would say... Busted... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It still does not mean it is creationism Einstein. Buddhism is a religion and its teaching can be seen as theological ( I take the view of Jose Ignacio Cabezon ). Buddhism does not recognise a creator god but its teachings would accomodate ID. Your basic premise is that ID is creationist. I have refuted this and basically eaten your lunch so you are trying as hard as your little brain allows to try to nail me. It would not matter if Buddhism was not a theology or even a religion.. it would still accomodate ID if it were considered a philosophy therefore the notion of ID is not exclusively creationist. Yes I do call you an imbecile and you have done nothing so far to make me doubt it You have a vey unhealthy obsession about EZ is it because he makes you feel ashamed because you are gay?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>ID is creationism and you haven't refuted anything. You're obviously confused.. And your frustration is showing again... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You obviously havent got the brains to understand my point. I tried to explain it to my dog and he didnt understand either. Maybe you just got mad because I outed you....<br><b> S2:3-  </b>ROFLMAO.. it appears you are the one who is frustrated.. people usually get that way when they are proven to be stupid. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You must feel like that lot<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No actually I never get that feeling.. Tell me what it feels like in case it ever happens to me.. I'm sure you're used to it by now.. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>You must be even stupider than I thought then. No wonder they threw you out of the forces<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Oh come on EZ JR. you can do better than that. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>But you are stupider than I thought and I am assuming that a tool like you would get thrown out of the armed forces.. quite reasonable. You really must control your obsession with EZ.. does he make feel ashamed that youre gay?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>ROFLMAO.. just for the record... Not Gay.. Never been thrown out of the Service.. Am Way smarter than you can ever hope to be.. And unlike you I don't change my position from one minute to the next... Just like many I have known over the years you have realized that you have been proven wrong and instead of being a man and just admitting it you resort to name calling and assumptions about someone you don't know... Pathetic to say the least.. And You should also maybe take some English lessons, the word " Stupider " makes you look even more stupid when you write it. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>You tend to just repeat quite a lot of what I post against you. Liar, coward, stupid, bitter, delusional and gay.. bet you would of made general. lol Where is the evidence for me defending ID?<br><b> S2:7-  </b>I told you it's in the other thread where you keep posting ignorance... Find it yourself, I don't have time nor am I concerned with XXXXXX. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>You made the claim, you prove it. You cant though can you and you genitals are far too tiny to admit you are wrong. You would be really concerned if you COULD find it.... what a<br><b> S2:8-  </b>Looks to me like you're confused.. ID is reasonable.. ID is not.. ID is Reasonable.. ID is not... OH wait.. I didn't defend ID... I'm a Christian, Or am I.. Damn I don't know... Sound familiar podunk <br><b>S1:9-  </b>Looks more like you're confused to me.<br><b> S2:9-  </b>Yeah I thought you would say that.. Hows that indecision working out for you. <br><b>S1:10-  </b>Wheres the evidence of your claim that I defended ID? Still no sign. No indecision there, just an imbecile who doesnt understand my premise<br><b> S2:10-  </b>I posted a couple of your quotes in the other thread.. what you don't recognize your own ignorance when you see it?... LMAO.. pathetic <br><b>S1:11-  </b>None of them showed any defence of ID. Just your confusion of what they inferred.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Lol.. Nice try but He was just a delusional Atheist Scientist who didn't believe in Creation. He didn't believe in intelligent design any more than I do. He merely thought thatIntelligent Lifeforms came here on space ships and influenced the evolution of Already living cells.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>In other words he fit the definition of an IDer. Besides which it seems a little odd for someone who ' discovered ' DNA to postulate that it could arise naturally but that's about it. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Uh no Podunk, he doesn't fit the definition of an ID'er because he doesn't believe in creation. They are one and the same after-all.. You of all should know, you've been attempting to Separate Creationism from Intelligent Design but so far have not been able to do so.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That is a begging the question fallacy, you assume your definition is correct then use that assumption to negate the proper definition. You are then forced to come up on the spot with a phrase to describe him. " He merely thought that Intelligent Lifeforms came here on space ships and influenced the evolution of Already living cells. " That is like saying " he's not a chef, he merely combines ingredients and prepares them into food ". I have been attempting to correct your mistake, and I know I have failed at that. I have explained quite clearly in this thread post 15 what the relationship between ID and creationism is. You had nothing to say but counter-assertion. You are... simply.. unwilling to consider a term with the meaning of ID. Not you alone, but it was just ' made up '. I am going to enjoy watching you and gansao continue in this artistic battle of... what is it called? It is like sarcastic digs, but also a play off the others words, but it boils down to counter-assertion. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You can't correct a mistake unless one has happened... I fully understand what the relationship between ID and Creation is. Intelligent Design is Creationism.. YOU are the one who fails to understand. How many times do you have to be proven wrong before you stop trying?...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No it isn't. ID - certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause Deal with it. I understand quite well that you are just going to keep asserting that ID is creationism till you turn blue in the face and never, ever make an argument towards that effect. Once. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>And the difference Is? " Intelligent Cause " That implies an Intelligent Form of Some kind Being involved. Id'ers Are notorious for being very specific not to mention a Higher Life Form or Supernatural Being as being that " Intelligent Cause " Fact.. A Inanimate Object does not have " Intelligence " I hope you will at least agree. Plus the Known fact that Intelligent Design was brought about by a group of Creationists who were XXXXXX because Creation Science is not allowed to be taught in schools. They have been trying to pass off Intelligent Design as Actual Science yet they fail to produce one shred of Scientific Data to back their theory. Intelligent Design IS neo Creationism.. Deal with that.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Post 15, this thread read it. That is because they foolishly hope that people like you are asking in good faith and want to know the difference. The truth is that even though you know the difference, even though you have practically spelled it out ; you still claim it doesn't exist. What more can a rational person do but sigh in disappointment? I agree, meaning ID implies a designer or agent of intelligence. That is irrelevant even if true. They have a lot of work to do if they are going to match the damage done to young minds by irrational evolution and anthropogenic climate change. Prove it. I continue to try because that is what I signed up for. I have not been proven wrong or else I would as you have pointed out stopped holding the position. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>You have been proven wrong, you just refuse to accept it so you keep trying to convince yourself that it's not true.. Intelligent Design is just another name for Creationism, that is a known fact to anyone who lives in reality.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Xcaliber, your counter assertion is becoming so distilled I only need to change one word to respond in kind : You have been proven wrong, you just refuse to accept it so you keep trying to convince yourself that it's not true.. Intelligent Design not is just another name for Creationism, that is a known fact to anyone who lives in reality. Both, the fallacy is called begging the question. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>lol.. You added a word.. not changed one.. Still doesn't change the fact that you're wrong and have been for some time now..<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Still doesn't change the fact that you're wrong and have been for some time now.. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>LMAO.. still the idiot I see.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>Oh you got me, I try not to say things like that. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Try harder...<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I ended another thread on this thought.... Dawkins claims that the human eye is not the product of intelligent design. He cites as a reason that it is so poorly put together. The inference from this though is that if you can detect poor design - as proof that there is no ' creator ', then we can also look for good design, as proof that there is! Thanks to Mr Dawkins raising the issue.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yes, he threw the ID camp a bone. Tell us, Monty - what have the ID ' scientists ' been doing to look for design? I mean besides reading other people's research and proclaiming " See! Design! "? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I'm glad you asked... William Dembski has come up with the " Explanatory Filter " to determine if something is a natural occurring event, or not. See p 171ff of " Doubts about Darwin : A History of Intelligent Design " by Thomas Woodward.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Unfortunately, Dembski and his " explanatory " filter are more hot air than substance. He has claiming to have ' discovered ' desing in nature by using the ' filter ', but for some strange reason, he has yet to publish his amazing discovery. he said he was going to do it in " Mere Creation ", then he said it would be iun " No Free Lunch " - so tell us, IS IT actually in his newest collection of apocryphal tall tales, or is is just assumed that he has done so? Common tactic - keep claiming that you will do something, then claim to have already done it later on, without, of course, actually doing it. The only times Dembski has acxtually applied it, he did it to things 1. we know were the product of design and 2. never did it on anything biological. It is all fluff and hot air. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So how long did Darwin take to publish?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>A while. But that was because he was afraid of the repercussions. Demsbki, unlike Darwin, has been a vocal, politically active proponant of the efficacy of his supposed filter. So, I take it that he did not actually use the filter in this latest collection of creationist essays, lest you would have just said so. How does it feel to be lead along like so many lemmings? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Simply put, the proposition was made that because he hasn't ' published ', he's wrong. By an extension of that logic, Darwin was also wrong, until he published. Another assumption you make is that Dembski isn't concerned over strife. I don't know? Would you care to tell me? But even worse an assumption is that Dembski is hiding something, by keeping all this information to himself, or his clique. You asserted this, I believe. Simply, this is not the case... http://www.arn.org/docs/dembski/wd_explfilter.htm and http://www.windowview.org/ARNfiles/E...erDembski.html and http://www-acs.ucsd.edu/~idea/dembski.htm OR If the information wasn't out there, then this negative critique could never have been drawn up... http://www.nctimes.net/~mark/bibl_science/dembski.htm and http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/p...th/sept98.html and http://www.talkreason.org/articles/dem_nfl.cfm So, there is already a debate raging. I'm sorry you missed it.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I was referring to post 127 to Dane in response to his insulting post about me. That post doesn't imply sticking my fingers in my ears at all TQ. It shows that we are from different Worlds though.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Telling you to stop lying and making inane claims is insulting? Well, you could always stop lying and making inane claims. Then the " insults " would stop. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I don't lie TQ, but you have proven very clearly that you wouldn't recognize the truth if you tripped over it. Because if you did, we would be on the same side of debates.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>1 ) I have but one response to this-what's your siggy say Archie? 2 ) Once again, I ask that you actually provide evidence of my dishonesty, or apologize. Enough it enough. Exactly how many times do you think you can continue to do this before you are banned? Do you have no shame? Noooo, I'm pretty sure I'm sane, so I accept reality as it is, without discarding the bits that don't agree with my preconceived notions. In order for us to be on the " same side ", I would have to pick and chose which bits of reality I happened to agree with, and in which circumstances. This has been pointed out to you amply in this thread by both Peeling and myself ( oops, I mean Electrolyte ) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Let's just agree to disagree TQ. I don't want to get into it with you again. I'm trying to avoid a confrontation here, and you are trying to provoke one. I wish you well TQ.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No, cut the ####. You called me dishonest again. You want to do that, provide some evidence. You are not walking away. You think callin me a liar for about the 30th time is " trying to avoid a confrontation "? You think me telling you to back up your slander is " trying to provoke one "? Not even close bub. Back it up already, and take your good wishes and stuff them. They mean nothing coming from you. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Like I said, And how do you intend to prevent me from walking away from your irrational attack? Because that is exactly what I am doing. Your threats are meaningless to me.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You know what? You are absolutely pathetic. 1 ) You call me a liar 2 ) I ask that you either provide evidence of my lying ways, or apologize. I provide proof that you, in fact, have a history of lying. 3 ) You then accuse me of trying to provoke you ( uh, you called me a liar, I asked you to prove it ) 4 ) I again say " Prove your allegations or apologize " 5 ) You call me irrational. You are absolutely, completely pathetic. You are an embarassment to any and all who call themselves Christian. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Here is what is so hypocritical once again TQ, but fits perfectly with your M.O. Below is my post from above that has set you off on this tirade accusing me of calling you a liar, when in fact that post clearly say's that you wouldn't recognize the truth if you tripped over it. That statement isn't saying you lie but is saying you don't recognize the truth. Go back and look at the original post if you don't believe me, go on, look. So in effect TQ, this very tirade and current attack by you is evidence of my past claims of your dishonest debating style. You have attempted to irrationally provoke a confrontation with me under the false pretense of me calling you a liar today, as I have repeatedly said I don't want to get into it with you. And now you are attacking my christianity as I am attempting to make peace with you. And in spite of your sorry attitude I still forgive you and wish you well. See how magnanimous I am trying to be with you? :)<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Oh, my mistake, you didn't call me a liar, you just said me and the truth had less than a passing acquaintance and implied I was a liar instead of outright stating it this time. You then, in this very post, state again how I am constantly dishonest. Yeah, I don't know how I ever got the idea that you consistently call me a liar. Once again, will you apologize for constantly slandering me? Or will you just run away again, as you always do when you are completely and utterly embarassed by your complete lack of integrity? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>See, there you go again. You get caught being irrational and attacking me unfairly, and as a result you claim victory, claim it is I who is embarrassed? And it is I who owes you an apology? So no TQ, I don't owe you an apology at all. You owe me one. If you will treat me with the same respect I have been treating you with here, we can finally get along. But as long as you attack me unfairly I will make my points in debates and not go back and forth attempting to answer to childish retorts. Sorry if that doesn't satisfy your demands, but that is how it will be. You see, you don't control this forum or my free will. So once again, be at peace.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Getting you to answer questions, use logic, stop insulting people, and provide evidence are " childish retorts " now, eh? And take your " be at peace " and " well wishes " and cram them. I am absolutely, positively, tired of your ####. You spent the last three weeks lying, insulting, jeering and in every way, shape and form violating the TOS of this site, yet you seem to think that because you haven't done that in the past hour, you're suddenly a golden boy. Guess what Archie? Your actions have repercussions. In other words, when you're a proven liar, fraud, and insult artist, you are going to continue being considered a liar, fraud, and insult artist for a long time to come. And accusing others of your faults in no way means they are magically removed from you, no matter what magical sky fairy you believe in, or how many " or " you end your posts with.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The same bet was made about how long answers in Genesis would last, and it has been going for years now. http://www.answersingenesis.org/<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Was it really, or is that just something you made up? Care to provide a useful link, one that might support your claim? As for how long this will last, that depends on how they decide to allocate their resources. They've been bilking the gullible for years, so they've got a fair wad of cash. If they really want to keep this going, they probably can for quite a while. Of course, every dollar they waste here is a dollar they can't use to try to buy an election or in advertising. I'm not sure that they can really do much more damage just by having their fantasies " reviewed " by those who have also bought into their fantasies ; the number of people who will be suckered by this that haven't already been suckered can't be that large. ( knock on wood :) ) I say if they want to throw their money away, more power to ' em! <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The fact is kronus that i was just responding to Ripskar asking if, and I quote : " Anyone fancy a sweepstake on how long this insanity will take to go belly up? " You see, he didn't offer a link that gave odds on his opinion so neither do I have to. But I'm sure that when http://answersingenesis.com came on line, atheists and anti christian bigots all over the internet took bets they would fail just as ripskar is doing now with the creation of this new site. It's just a common sense deduction dontya know.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I know exactly what you were saying. And it seems I was right, you have nothing to back up your claim that people were betting that it would fail. It's just something you're " sure " of, i.e. something you made up. Like I figured. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You mean just as Ripskar did, and then pandion after him? And since when is giving ones opinion making something up on a debate forum? And why are you taking basic statements I make and attacking me as if this is a relevant issue at all, while completely ignoring the fact that both ripskar and pandion made the same bet type statement? Have you no sense of fair play at all? Or are you just here to troll after me and nit pick every obscure statement I make?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Not in the least. Ripskar did in fact, right here right now, predict the failure of this new publication. There's no question about that, we saw it happen. Your claim that the other website was predicted to fail? We have no evidence of that, you have in fact all but confirmed that you just guessed that such predicitons were made. When you present it as fact. You presented your imaginary data in refutation of Ripskar's prediction, that makes it fair game. Face it, you made something up in a debate and got caught, have the integrity to bow out gracefully. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Again, how incredibly shallow and one sided kronus. With your sense of objectivity and fair play, why aren't you insisting that pandion also justify this statement with links to support what he states as facts? Could it be because you are a, oh I don't know, A HYPOCRITE? Think about it kronus.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>So I guess you don't have the required integrity to admit when you're wrong. No surprise. Oh, and you seem to be ignorant of the meaning of the word " hypocrite ". If I were making up imaginary bets and using them as evidence while critisizing you for doing the same, then I would be a hypocrite. Nothing requires me to comment on every person who doesn't provide links ; common sense dictates that efforts should be reserved for the worst offenders, those who have a history of speaking ex-recto.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>As Blessed Augustine said, ' whenever a Biblical passage seems to fall short, I realise my interpretation is at fault '<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yes, indeed! Just reinterpret the passage to mean exactly what you want it to! Bwahahahaha! What a shame you can't see the forest for the trees Monty! <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Imakenosense, irony was never one of your strong points. Which theory of evolution do you hold to?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Whatever do you mean Monty? There is only one theory of evolution. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Really? The Dawkins / Darwin model? The Stephen Jay Gould model? Funny you can believe in a system that holds such mutually exclusive trains of thought. I've found several schools of thought that exist, just on the issue of how modern man arose. AND We've got the ' people started in Africa ' belief, and now the ' people started in China ' belief. I believe there is only one God. You're knee-jerk response will probably be ' which one? ' Irony, oh the irony!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Monty, your ignorance in the scientific method and what the theory of evolution is is telling. How can one put it any simpler? there is only one theory of evolution. Just as wja has said, ' Evolution is the process producing diversity of living organisms through random mutation and natural selection. ' You seem to be confusing hypothesis and modelling as being the actual theory. Really Monty, you should try to learn what evolution is before you try to argue against it. Why is the god you believe in the only one? What puts him above all of the others, including all of the other gods mentioned in the bible? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>It's nice to try and compartmentalise things into neat little packages like that. One is the theory One is the evidence. What is the theory without evidence? It is no longer a scientific ' fact '. So, What sort of evidence has it got? Conflicting, ergo, evolution sucks.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Monty, once again your ignorance in all things pertaining to evolution and the scientific method is showing. A model is not the theory. Hypotheses may even conflict. However, you have yet to show where the conflicting evidence is. Game playing such as this diminishes your position even further. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Imakenosense, fine, you believe that conflicting hypothesis, using the same evidence can all be the only proof you need for evolution. I have linked up sites that say man arose in China. This conflicts with current theory. I have linked up sites that say that Neanderthal is a pre-cursor of man, a direct ancestor that is. Others say he's not, he's a dead-end. Ain't nothing gonna change that. I'm sorry that I won't play ' grand-standing ' with you.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Please go and read that link about scientific method that was given to you Monty. You are now in full denial mode. A hypothesis may indeed conflict with other hypotheses but the theory remains the same. You just don't want to get it do you Monty? All of your moaning about conflicting theories just exposes your lack of knowledge layer by layer. You were so pedantic about semantics in other fora but now you have decided to change the rules and bend meanings and definition to suit your own cartoon versions of what you think evolution and scientific method is. I'd say you even call black white even if the empirical data presented to you suggested otherwise. Tell me more about why you thing there is only one god when the bible patently talks about a multitude of gods. Oh and do you believe that there are planets in other solar systems? I'd really like to know.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No, an advantageous structure is not an " abnormal structure. Get real. See, I can answer my own challenge.... I can show how new structures and modifications are generated -- the only problem is it contradicts the materialist / randomness / accidental requirement of darwinists :<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So please explain in detail how the Dapnina system actually works! I wait with bated breath for you explanation of how genetic plasticity dependent on the secretion of a specific trigger compound by the predator is non-material and involves intelligence, and just how the secretion of similar compounds by the spiky Daphnia which maintain the effect contradicts materialism in any way. Good luck. Consider it a challenge. I leave it up to you to chase the relevant papers down in the literature. I have done it in the past and know what I am talking about. If you simply ignore them I will beat you badly about the head with them as necessary. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>who cares how it works..... when you were in school and answered math problems on paper, did your teacher come around and ask to look inside your brain to figure out what the mechanism was so she could verify how you got the right answer right? No!... the proof was right there in front of her.... who cares how the answer was arrived at. Ultimately life has no mechanism -- at least no scientific mechanism that can be measured. Life goes against science at every turn.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well if you don't know how it works how can you make a claim that it proves your case! If you don't know how it works you have no proof of what you are claiming at all. If I were to say I did not care how the sickle cell trait system and malaria interacted and still used it to prove my case what would your response be? Would you accept my claim without dispute, would it be proof of my contention. No way - you would be on me like a duck on a junebug. You had bloody well care about how systems you claim as proof of a hypothetical mechanism work - else be laughed off the stage at even a grammer school argument! I can see Newton saying well these orbital data prove my point - but I don't care or know how it works!!!!!! High credibility - I think not. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The difference is the results of the experiment are self-explanatory in that it's obvious that the newly-generated structure was a result of an interaction between the organism and predator ( s ). Therefore, randomness is ruled out, which is all that's required to undermine the foundation of darwinism and materialism. How it might have happened might be fun for scientists to sort out, but I have no real interest in it.... partially because it is clear that mental processes were ultimately responsible, and mental processes cannot be fully understood anyway, so why bother?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I did not say the response was random. Indeed its clearly a wide spread non-mutaional process which affects a fair fraction of the population in question. But its also not an evolutionary change is it? Or don't you know ( or care? ) how it works yet? And sorting it out is essential if you wish to make claims about how it works which you are in fact doing. And if you have no interest in the key proof of your argument you are not treating the issue in a serious way are you. Talk about playing games. You apparently prefer to make claims of proof based on things which you know little or nothing about - how easy that must make it - till someone points that out of course. And you think mental processes are responsible yet I will bet that you have never even seen a live daphnia let alone examined ones brain or taught one to perform circus tricks, or coverse! You argument ends of course with the immortal words... So now you admit that its due to mental processes but you have no understanding of those processes and you are too lazy intellectually to examine the very observations which you have oddly enough chosen to make the centerpiece of how you belive life functions. WOW <br><b>S1:4-  </b>not, I'm not lazy at all... I'm just not interested...... I don't even like science. It bores me.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Yes its abundantly clear that you know little or nothing about the subjects of your posts. Ignorance is not a pretty sight. Scientific ignorance is a disgusting one. Deliberate and uncaring scientific ignorance cannot be looked upon without using a mirror of some sort lest ones own brain turn to stone. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>chemist, I may not have a love for science like you do but there is more to life than science -- I know that may be hard for you to digest... but life is more than chemicals and molecules. I have other pleasures and hobbies than always sticking my nose in science books.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Creationists do not come here to debate. Indeed as Benedict points out in the OP, attempting to is rather pointless. the question then is what are they here for? They are almost invariably adolescent males, they are flooded with testosterone and desperate to challenge for dominance - carrying out the dictates of their genetic instructions. As such their first post is invariably a general challenge, same as that of any vertebrate male. Bellow, beat your chest, puff your self up, roll in your own scent. What will instantly deflate them is humour, sharpest blade in the kit. Ridicule prevents them from claiming dominance. That is why they leave in days.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>:) Creationists debate on this forum in the same ways as you d o.. they express their opinions. If attempting to debate with them is pointless then dont debate... is that a problem? The rest of your post is BS and not worth debating... I know how you <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I've been here since 2004 and I've yet to see a scientificly literate creationist. Do let us know if one crawls out of the ooze.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So what? If they believe the moon is made from green cheese they are as entitled to express that a much as you have t o.. cough.. teach them otherwise or ignore them. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You can't teach them anything. However you can communicate in a manner they will understand. If they believe the moon is made of green cheese you can show them samples of lunar rock and the spectrograph analysis and it won't make a scrap of difference. Make it clear that what they've said is ridiculous and the point has been communicated.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Thats fine and a long way from driving them off the forum.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>We do not know how life first began and there is more then one theory as to how it might have happened. Do you believe there is only one theory offered by the scientific community? So agan, when asking the question, how did life begin, how many probabilities are there?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>There is only one type theory, a modification of Darwinism. It is entirely truly pathetic attempts to graft natural selection and mutation to non-biological, non-reproducing situations. To this day a joke in my family for an explanation for any amazing occurrence is that it happened " on the backs of crystals ". <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Wrong, the correct answer is ; I don't know.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The answer to what question? I am impressed by your ability to dismiss an argument based on your personal authority ; it shows true arrogance ( or credulity if it is on the collective authority of others ). It is attitudes like this that make the comparison between the leftist manias and religion so easy. Neither of you feel the need to defend ' facts '... Well I will always call that bluff. You don't feel the need because you don't have the ability. Religion has had much more time to learn how to deal with rational people than these sprouts and as far as I am concerned that was a primitive way of saying : " it's a matter of faith ". <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If you don't know maybe you should not have answered it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The question I believed I was answering was this one : " Do you believe there is only one theory offered by the scientific community? " Are you saying the correct answer is " I don't know? " I certainly know what I believe. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You are incorrect again.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Interesting, just for the fun of it why don't I assert you are the one who is incorrect ( about what I don't know ). <br><b>S1:5-  </b>How do you know?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I don't The only thing I calculated was lower limit on the odds that any particular 20 amino acids are coded for randomly. The way I calculated it was correct. Appeal to infinite odds. An argument from ignorance would be as follows " No one has shown how life could have formed from these chemicals by random chance, therefore it is impossible " He is saying ( I think ) and he is correct to say " It is impossible for life to be formed by these chemicals and random chance, because of the odds involved " What you say to him and you have said to me despretly many times is " nuh uh, it's not impossible because there are SO many ways for life to form or SO many possible novel functions that the odds you calculated are neutralized. That is a true inverse of a appeal to ignorance ; since you believe no one can know all the possible chains of events that might lead to novelty or life there must be enough of them to make it likely. I call it an appeal to infinite odds and I have given you examples where it is applied to other subjects which reveal its invalidity. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Why?......<br><b> S2:6-  </b>I have no reasons to think you would be wrong. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>About what?<br><b> S2:7-  </b>No clue. and that is appealing to preexisting information, you have said it before and I did not ignore you before. It is a temporal fallacy as my point is about where the information is coming from. You were the one who brought up the 20 amino acid number * just admit it you thought that was a simple protein ( and it is compared to most ). You know all the times people pointed out to me there are bigger mutations than base pair changes? The reason those aren't more significant than smaller mutations is because the odds for novelty don't increase and my making that remark you imply the same. You may easily back out from your 20 amino acid assertion but you can't do that and maintain the point it was making about the possibility for novelty. For instance 4000 amino acids may only be 4 base pairs away from novelty, that is not a leap of 4004 amino acids it is of four. Similarly if you have 20 amino acids 18 of which already exist in the proper order the leap is 2 not 20. Well what do you expect when you try to challenge the fact and the theory of his God?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Like any scientific theory, evolution is our current best attempt at explaining how the organims we see around us today came to be. Like any scientific theory, it is inherently falsifiable. Find a rodent with DNA more similar to humans than mice or find a monkey or dinosaur fossil in cambrian rocks and you would disprove large parts of evolution theory. " Evolutionists " as a whole would then respond by seeking a new theory to explain how the organims we see around us today came to be. Evolution isn't supported through faith ; it is supported through fact. It has no need for faith as it isn't something that would be clung to if it were ever proven false. YEC is the opposite. Do not deceive yourself into thinking that " literal " Biblical Creation would be proved true if evolution were proven false. We would need a third theory. YEC has been thoroughly and utterly disproven. YEC needs faith for it has nothing else to sustain it.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I am very interested to know exactly how they haven utterly disproven YEC? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Then go study a course on geology. It is the entire science of geology that has completely disproven a YEC " literal " reading of Genesis. The Earth is old and there was no global flood a few thousand years ago.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Who is to say that the guys teaching the geology know what they are teaching? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>That is irrelevent. One of the things that should always be hammered home to students in any science class is to never blindly accept what you are taught as fact, but to question and challenge it. Of course religion is taught the same, no? You have been encouraged to question every verse in the Bible, to compare it to other religions, to question the evidence and the teacher at every stage, have you not? Of course not. You have been told to believe the Bible and to not question it, for it is " the word of God ". I think that is the root cause of your problem. We aren't demanding that you accept evolution, geology, cosmology etc without question. Instead we are encouraging you to question, to doubt and to think for yourself. You can't deal with the lack of security that this approach offers.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Sorry Clive 14, i dont want to offend you champ, but that was the greatest load of HOGWASH i have ever heard!!!!. " we aren't demanding that you accept evolution without question ". What happens if a kid in class has asked the questions and still doesant accept the evolution theory. I will tell you what happens, he gets thrown to the side and gets the guts bagged out of him, just like alot of others on this site!!!!!!. They are taught to think for themselves????. Would it be true if a person that is allowed to think for themselves is a person that would have the room to place ALL of the evidence that is in the world around him, onto the examineing table? A person is still required to believe the whole evolution theory, other wise he is a lost cause... This is probably why alot of evolutionists that dont accept the evolution theory dont own up. Its either that their to scared!, or they dont want to lose their grant money.. And as for the bible study, when was the last bible study group that you went to?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You can call the los alimos research lab that did the assay on the sample of the petrified timber if you want. Mayabe they are " Hacks " as you put it. Steven Hawkings, and Albert Einstein believe God exists. They must be a bunch of flakes and hacks. Thanks for clearing that up! We better throw out the theories of relativity put forth by einstein! Hey everybody! This man is a genius! He discovered that Einstein is a fraud! Thank the heavens!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Really? And you have sources to back up this statement? Please provide them. Thanks! ( BTW -- Which ' god ' do Hawking and Einstein ' believe exists '? ) <br><b>S1:2-  </b>A supreme being, thats good enough for me. If someone believes in buddah, thats just a different name for god. as for Hawking, he is a devout christian, and has a much more strict faith than i ever will. Einstein? You can quote him from several of his writings. And if I could give you the sources off of the top of my head, then I would.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I'm not asking you to provide sources off the top of your head. I'm asking you to do a little work and research that which you are discussing so that if you make claims during the discussion, you are able to back them up with reputable sources. I have done a bit of research on my own, and I believe your claims are inaccurate -- or misleading at best. However, since YOU are the one making the claims, it is up to YOU to provide references for them. If you cannot, then there is no logical reason your claims should be accepted as true. Sound fair enough? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I dont expect anyone to accept my claims as true, and sometimes I just blurt out what i think is true to make a point. please replace budist with muslim in the post that I messed up on. I just meant anyone who believes in a higher power.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>How can you make a valid point when you blurt out what you ' think ' is true, without any idea whether it is actually true? What is your point, anyway? If you want to participate fruitfully on a debate forum, I'd encourage you to have your facts straight and have references available... keep an open mind... and gracefully admit when your argument is illogical, based on untrue facts, or based on any fallacy. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Did I not admit that my argument was illogical using buddah? Besides, do you always use references when you debate?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Im not talking about wyatt, The discovery of a volcanic eruption on the other side of the ocean, wich caused underwater earthquakes, that caused a tsunami that crossed the ocean and drew the water out of the bay that they called the sea of reeds just long enough for them to cross, and then the ocean came crashing back in and layed the smack down on the bad guys. Sounds like a believable miracle to me. Again, nothing to do with wyatt.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Right, Uh Huh. Lets see you post a peer reviewed archelogical journal with this claim. I notice you switched from Mount arafat to the exodus mid steam too. Isn't that lovely. Equally silly too.. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Sorry bout that switch, if you want, I'll find the names of the scientists and labs that did the assays on the petrified timbers, and the remains of the bolts, as well as the ballast material that was in the hull of the ship, seeing as how it is clear that you havent read the information on the site that i gave you.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I asked for a peer reviewed article on from an archelogocal journal, not a fancy web site put up by frauds, cons, and flakes. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You can call the los alimos research lab that did the assay on the sample of the petrified timber if you want. Mayabe they are " Hacks " as you put it. Steven Hawkings, and Albert Einstein believe God exists. They must be a bunch of flakes and hacks. Thanks for clearing that up! We better throw out the theories of relativity put forth by einstein! Hey everybody! This man is a genius! He discovered that Einstein is a fraud! Thank the heavens!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Like I said, show me a peer reviewed article about it. I don't accept any information that comes from a Ron Wyatt web site. You DO know what a peer reviewed scientific article about it, isn't it? And, by the way, you are mistating ALbert Einsteins view of God. That is very dishonest of you, and by the way, totally irrelavent to the discustion about the claims from Ron Wyatt. As for my asking the alamo labs, why shoudl it. It's your claim. you provide the evidence. You know WHY you aren't going to?? Because you can't.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You can insist your right all you like sp, and insult me all you like. That does nothing to strengthen your ridiculous insistence that Angels have free will. Plain and simple, you have no idea what your talking about regarding the Bible or spiritual topics so I'm wasting my time trying to reason with the likes of you and the ignorant child in any case. So wallow in your blind ignorance and be happy in it. I'm through with you.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Hey, Archangel, I notice you didn't respond to the points I made - no argument, huh? To quote Jyoshu : " Well since you didn't address my points, I'll assume you're done! A simple " ok, I concede that... and moving on back to the issues... " *** Jyoshu Well, everyone, looks like our EZ / SS clone has finally realized his argument was wrong. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I concede nothing to you SP. I just realize that trying to reason with the likes of you and your side kick is a waste of my time and effort. Claim all the victory you want if it strokes your shallow ego but it wont make you any more right.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>To quote Jyoshu : " Well since you didn't address my points, I'll assume you're done! A simple " ok, I concede that... and moving on back to the issues... " *** Jyoshu :) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Whatever floats your boat buddy. But does it matter that you didn't raise any points worth addressing? Is that relevant at all from your extremely limited perspective?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I raised plenty of points. You just didn't want to address them. I am content with the fact that any person with half a brain looking at this thread will see how you began to squirm when we pointed out to you that lucifer and his fellow angels had free will, and then see how you totally stopped responding to points once we pointed out that what you claimed about the angels was precisely the definition of " free will "<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It is interesting that this has come up. On another baord, a creationist that has a BS in electronics engineering claimed that he is a " scientist " because he has a bachelor's of SCIENCE, and that therefore, his opinions on evolution should carry as much weight as any other ( real ) scientist. They do what they have to to convinve themselves ( and others ) that their opinions actually have merit.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>As I have already stated, I would not consider someone to be a scientist unless they have a phD. However, I just went to a science museum on vaction two weeks ago and they had a whole room devoted to the science of engineering. I do not agree that because you can earn a B.S. in it it makes it a science. However, they fact that MrJack pointed out that some universites consider Math to be science and some don't shows that obviously there is also a debate over this and so neither side is right. In one final concluding mark I turn to my old faithful unabridged Webster's for a defintion of science : ( I am not writing it all, you will have to trust I didn't leave out anything that could prove your point or look it up yourself and counter quote me. ) 2. Any bracnh or department of systemized knowledge considered as a distinct field of observation or study. 4. A branch of study which is concerned with observation and classification of facts, esp. with the establishment ( and, strictly, the quantitative formulation ) of verifiable general laws, chiefly by induction ( Well, there are eight, I will end there ) So, although Webster is no scientist ( or is he? ) the point is it is kind of a pointless debate. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Indeed. One should wonder then why so many creationists expend so much energy insisting that they are scientists or that thier sources are...<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I am all for creationists forming their own branch of discovering things and not call it science. However, I also believe there are certain strong Christians who are able ( and needed ) to go to public universities and study the religion of science in an effort to keep up on its current theories and debates so that they can be refuted or at least so that a logical arguement can be presented for God. However, I have read the end of the book, and I know that I am fighting a losing battle. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Sad how readily intelligent humans can be buffloed by ancient mythology...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Sad how people who allude to being intellegent call everything the Bible says mythology, when PhD historians from state universities admit there is more history than " mythology " in the Bible. I suppose you still believe that Homer only wrote myths and Troy never existed also? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>No, in fact I believe that because Trpy existed, Achilles really did injure Aphrodite in human form during the battle, and that Zeus and Hera intervened as they saw fit. Of course there is ' history ' in the bible - otherwise, it would be a totaL fabrication. However, as you have unwittingly admitted, simply because places exist / existed there is no reason nor rationale to conclude that the supernatural myths that arose around these places and peoples are true.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>And if God used evolution, then why did Jesus come to us? Are we just ' lucky apes '? What about a saviour for all animals?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You are assuming your personal theology is correct when it    s only a belief. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I believe you'll find that a "? " at the end makes it a question, not a statement. I was asking you and other theistic evolutionaries a question.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But if your theology is incorrect, there is no question to answer. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It is true that the question was loaded ; a question never-the-less. So, why did Jesus come to earth? If you think we're descended from ape-like beings, why choose us to save?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well if your theology is wrong, he came to earth the same reason any of us did. He was born here. There may or may not be a God, but he didn    t send anyone to save anyone. But I    ll go along with your question. Maybe the Bible is right in a theological sense. Maybe God evolved us to a certain point where he basically said okay you    ve developed enough for a soul. Then he breathed a soul into    Adam    which could have represented a pair or a group of people. Or it could be as I believe, that we are to the point where we are evolving a soul / spirit as well as a body. I know there are other possibilities but those are the first three that popped into my mind. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Perhaps I should re-word my question.... Why did Jesus come to us? My understanding of theology is that Jesus came to save us, to redeem us for the guilt caused by Adam.... So if you believe in a ' lucky ape ' that evolved a soul or was granted a soul, or whatever... and you're not really answered the question... ( what do you believe ; just given a range of options )... when was the first sin committed? What happened for there to be a need for Jesus?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I understand your question montalban but you don    t understand my answer. Let me see if I can make it clearer. I    m saying your understanding of theology is wrong in my view. Jesus wasn    t the son of God so he didn    t come for any reason. He was just a man with a great message that was way ahead of his time. But he didn    t save anybody from anything. There never was a first sin so there never was a need to be saved from anything. I understand that is not what YOU believe, but it is what I believe. That    s what I meant by maybe your theology is wrong. Does that explain what I am trying to say. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Got it. For you Jesus is some cool dude.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I wouldn    t describe it like that. As I said, I think he was way ahead of his time. I think you are being sarcastic. LOL I have been thinking a lot about our recent conversation and I have taken notice of how many times I use sarcasm or that it is used on me during the day. It averages about 4 times a day. Every time we all get a good laugh out of it. I    m trying to say that sarcasm is a standard part of my conversation in my personal life. I understand that it can be used to insult people, but my culture is using it for fun. Maybe were have a communication problem based on different cultures. I    m also not saying that I never use it to insult or put down something I think is ridiculous, just that normally I use it as a way of just kidding around. And this is regardless of any dictionary definition. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I am not trying to be sarcastic ; but you may have perceived that I was - so I'm sorry for that. And actually reading it again, I'd say it's more akin to being facetious than sarcastic ; and I don't think sarcasm's a valid form of debate... unless you're friends with the other person and you know how they will take it. I also don't mean to be putting words into your mouth - so when I call him a ' dude ' I am trying to ascertain what it is that you think Jesus was doing here.... Also I don't think it's cultural. I am, as I said, highly pedantic. I try to say what I mean. Another poster on another thread has read into my posting of a question some kind of conspiracy or trap. I have said that it's not. And it's not. And you have what is to me a flippant approach. Why'd God send him - just as a messenger / guru? If so, then obviously as a messenger, He's failed, becuase most of us believe He's the Son of God sent here to end death. PS Logic is not the sole domain of science.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The evidence for creation is in the Bible - but every one of the evolutionaries here won't even accept that as ' evidence ', so, I for one must talk to them using their own definitions of things and see if these hold up. We need a common ground for understanding and as Lurch and others quite clearly state that the Bible is fantasy, then there's no point me discussing the various merits of the Bible... we are forced by necessity to discuss evolutionary science alone.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The Bible is not scientific evidence. If you want to support some Theory of Creation, you will need to do it without the Bible. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Exactly what I said they'd say! So, we are forced, in the interest of continuing dialogue, to point out all of the flaws in there argument.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So you admit there is NO scientific evidence of any theory of creation. Thanks. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>a ) you don't accept the Bible as evidence b ) you don't accept creationist evidence as evidence therefore we must rely on what you do actually accept as evidence and argue with that. I hope you can understand that...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Correct. The Bible is scripture, not empirical evidence. You haven't offered any " creationist evidence ". That's what we've been asking for. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Of course, the above poster would also discount witness testimony in a court. The Bible is testimony. Quite apart from that historians do ( arguably to different degrees ) use the Bible as an historical document. This too, the above poster ignores. So, all the evidences in the Bible aren't recognised, blanketly by the above poster. Hence, when faced with such dogged attachment to ignorance, we have to look to their own fields of belief<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Which author of the Bible was alive during the creation of the world, the creation of all organisms, and the Noachian flood? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>God was there. God inspired the Bible's books. He certainly communicated directly with Moses and other prophets. Then Jesus, God Incarnate, talks of God as Father, and Creator etc.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>You've wandered into the completely unverified and unverifiable. One could claim God to be the author of any text. " And then a giant turtle layed an egg which became the Earth and on it all the organisms of the world instantaneously grew upon it " - God Look. I've got eyewitness testimony from God. Turtleism destroys evolution and creationism. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Crim, you asked me a question. I already know that you won't accept the evidence or that it is evidence. It's well and truly vapid to say you've got testimony from God, because you don't believe in God. So what argument have you presented? None, just a restatement for the ' x'th time of your athiesm.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Correct. I've just shown that you don't have anything to back yours up. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>Err.. no all you've stated is that you don't recognise the evidence. Then we are back to square one.. my original statement that the reason we discuss these issues with you is out of respect for your failings to understand the ' big ' picture... that is, things that exist beyond sciences capacity to describe. So we have to use your limited framework... Science only deals with a limited part of the universe. Did other planets in other solar systems exist before science discovered them? If you say ' yes ' then you'd have to recognise that there are things that ARE before they ARE SCIENTIFIC... Do you believe in extra-terrestrial life?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Blabbering incoherently as usual, it seems... Actually, I had not been reading this forum much, and only noticed that you posted in this thread recently. But I can see that you are your usual " Christian " self - the same angry malcontent that got blown away in every other thread... Do you really think you are that important that I should have noticed? Wow... Frankly, I have no clue what you are talking about. You did, of course, oddly continue altering your claims re : Dembki's filter and my claims regarding it as it suited you. There seems to be no serious debate going on here, at least not fomr ' your side. ' I have not followed this thread, so I have no idea what you are talking about here, either. I see your penchant for projecting is still intact... No idea what you are talking about. Goes to show how important you are to me...<br><b> S2:1-  </b>No I don't think I'm so important that you should have noticed. However, if you're going to comment that I've moved on entirely, then you should check to see that you have. That you won't even concede now that I said I was moving to other posts is astounding. Blabbering dishonesty on your part. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>What is to concede? As usual, the obsessed malcontent can only focus on irrelevancies and minutiae. Milton, o Milton, where art thou oh self-important non-scientist journalist?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>reminder... :) Maths :) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Reminder : irrelevant.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>SLP can dish it out but can't take it. Maths :) That's cool <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Dish what out? Have you found a use for Dembski's " filter " yet? Do any Universities in Australia use any of Dembski's amazing maths in their programs?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>you know..... evidence is a funny thing... it often can be interpreted in many different ways. Darwinists are great a putting a goofball spin on otherwise obvious evidence that supports the notion that life is not a random / accidental / materialist / mechanical occurrence........ but nothing -- and I mean NOTHING -- makes scientists look more stupid than when they see red, soft tissue dug out of dinosaur bones and then wonder outloud how it could have preserved for 70 million years! If you asked 1000 individuals on the street if they thought animal flesh could last 70 million years in the ground without turning to stone or composting, I bet 999 of them would say no. The bottom line is darwinism is stupid, materialism is wrong,..... evolution is not only unsupported by any evidence, but it is physically impossible. Anyone glossing over the fact that dinosaur soft tissue was found embedded in the bones, only to turn their head to the sky and wonder how it could have lasted 70 million years is a dang fool.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This has been explained to you too many times to count. " Red, soft tissue " was not " dug out of dinosaur bones ". I've explained this to you at least twice, and I know others have explained this to you as well. Mary Schweitzer herself denies your interpretation of her findings. This leaves only two conclusions : 1 ) you are a dishonest person who conciously lies to further your own agenda, or 2 ) you are unable to comprehend what is said to you, and it is in fact a wonder that you are able to operate a computer without electrocuting yourself and those around you. So, which is it SS? Liar, or just plain stupid? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>all you have to do is look at the pictures... a 1st grader could do it!<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Do you know how to read or do you just look at the pictures? I've already explained at least twice why you are wrong. I've linked to articles and interviews with Mary Schweizer. But nope, " just look at the pictures! " trumps the researcher. I guess I have my answer. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>What Mary Schweizer has denied is that there were blood vessels..... and likewise, I did not make that claim. Nobody, however disputes -- besides you, of course -- that there was soft tissue found... deal with it. http://news.nationalgeographic.com/n...o-tissues.html<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You do realize I've provided you many links that explained it was not " red, soft tissue " that was found, right? You remember this, don't you? And yet you keep peddling the same story every couple months. Why is that? http://talkorigins.org/faqs/dinosaur/flesh.html So, again, it's not " red soft tissue " that was found. It's the permineralized remnants of what seem to be osteocytes, blood cells, and blood vessels. Not exactly the " fresh meat " you seem to like to imply it is. The samples were soaked in acid to remove the minerals. Exactly how " red " and " soft " was this tissue. Keep going, you make yourself look more the fool everytime <br><b>S1:4-  </b>it's soft, it's tissue, and it's red.... you are just delusional.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>marc 9000, so if ID were true what could we do with it? What major scientific discoveries would ID give us?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>In Dembski's words " Intelligent design continues to look for function where nonteleological approaches to evolution attribute clumsiness or incompetence. " I think the best way to look at it is like an analyzation of any old cliff face in a state like Tennesee vs looking at Mount Rushmore. One who believes that Mount Rushmore was designed is going to learn more, both about it, and how it compares to the Tennesse cliff, than is the person who believes they both came to be in exactly the same way. If abiogenesis were true, what could we do with it? What major scientific discoveries would abiogenesis give us? ( Scientific discoveries, not social discoveries, like bigger government, closure of churches, etc. ) <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yeah that    s nice some guy with a religious bias said something ridiculous big deal. I don    t think you really understand ID at all. You keep slipping into the science is a conspiracy thing and that is what is really driving your arguments. How many thick books have you read about ID?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But you gotta admit, it's nowhere near as ridiculous as    abiogenesis is a fact   . I don    t think those who seek to destroy something are good judges of the relevant understanding of that subjects promoters. What    s driving my arguments is clear inconsistencies, and biased, non-scientific behavior going on in the scientific community, including claims that ID is a conspiracy theory, and I    m not alone. More people than ever are home-schooling their children    the movie    Expelled    showed serious problems in academia. The emotional reaction to that movie from the scientific community was very telling. Very little, if any, admission of problems. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I ask one used car salesman how a car works and he says,    magic makes it go.    I say can you show me the magic or explain how the magic works and he says,    no you just have to trust me   . I ask another used car salesman the same question and he gives me a detailed comprehensible and logical explanation of the workings of the internal combustion engine. What    s really neat is that he can show me how all the stuff works. The only thing he can    t show me is combustion taking place inside the cylinder but what    s happing all around it certainly indicates that combustion is indeed taking place. Which man would you buy a used car from?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Like, " no you just have to trust me, abiogenesis is a fact "? A tornado blew through the junkyard of abiogenesis, and this car appeared! Yes, it was designed! Designers can select for future function, it's a characteristic of design! He can show you how it works, and he doesn't have to show you exactly who designed it! The one who showed that something with complex order was designed by an intelligent source. ;)<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Why bother, your ignorance says it all. Here, educate yourself regarding the fraud perpetrated by people who think like you do. Haeckels Fraud<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Ooo ooo!! Post the one about Piltdown Man too, and about the brave creationists who went against the scientific establishment to prove they were both frauds! Oh, wait, it was actual scientists who uncovered both and proved them, decades ago... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>And they are still using Haeckel's fraudulent drawings in textbooks in the 21st century. That's how honest todays evolutionists are. How proud you must be. Evolution News & Views : The Textbooks Don? t Lie : Haeckel? s Faked Drawings Have Been Used to Promote Evolution : Raven & Johnson ( 2002 ) ( Part 2 )<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Oh, those are Haeckel's drawings? I don't think so. What you don't seem to realize Archie is embryo's of different species are similar at certain developmental stages. Haeckel's " crime " was in glossing over the differences in order to prop up his hypothesis : Ontogeny recapitulates phlyogeny. That was false. Take a look at the photos, and you can clearly see the similarities : Basics : The pharyngula stage : Pharyngula <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Please don't confuse the debate with Meyers propaganda, ok? Let's stick to facts of what I said for once. I said that Haeckel's drawings are still being used in the 21st century as evidence in text books. Here are Haeckel's drawings side by side with the drawings in Raven and Johnson's text book in 2002. As the caption in the link says : Figure 1 : Haeckel's Embryo Drawings ( Rotated ) Next to Raven & Johson ( 2002 ) for Comparison of Near-Identical Similarities http://www.evolutionnews.org/haeckelraven1.jpg And here we have Haeckel's drawings OVERLAIN on the drawings in the same text book for comparison. http://www.evolutionnews.org/haeckeloverlay.jpg Now what is it you were saying about these NOT being Haeckel's drawings? And which of us doesn't realize the reality of the situation? I think that would be you. And here is the link I posted which this info is based upon. Evolution News & Views : The Textbooks Don? t Lie : Haeckel? s Faked Drawings Have Been Used to Promote Evolution : Raven & Johnson ( 2002 ) ( Part 2 )<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You should try reading what others post for once. As I said before, Haeckel was correct-there are similarities, which support common descent. His fraud came from exaggerating the similarities and downplaying the differences. And, to anyone who even gives a cursory glance at the drawings of Haeckel and those in the textbook, the difference is obvious. I even posted photos to show that his underlying concept was correct. Of course, you ignore them as " propoganda ". To which I have no reply, as anyone who displays such a callous disregard for reality as you do is beyond reason.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I'm still not sure why you think that if other animals show intelligence, that somehow flies in the face of evolution. You keep stating these things together, but never actually draw the connection.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>** You get it wrong again. It does not fly in the face of evolution, not at all. But it does fly in the face of darwinism. ** Nope. Some things, like tying your own shoelaces, you simply have to do for yourselves. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>What I was saying was, you consistently try to make al these points without actually making any points.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>** Suit yourself. If people like you are incapable of seeing that to which your attention has been directed, clearly and and plainly, all by yourselves, then there is no point in me rubbing your noses in it. You'll just have to reman confused, bewildered, and stunned. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>None of us here are confused, bewildered, or stunned at any of the information you've put up here. It's all very interesting, it's just that none of it contradicts anything we already know. The only thing that baffles us is that you seem to think it does.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>** Well, it does not baffle me that you people cannot see how this material flat-out contradicts your beliefs about evolution, biology, and existence in general. I'd be very surprised if any of you had what it takes to actually recognise and appreciate what you're looking at. But hopefully you true-believers are not the only ones who read my stuff, and some of those others may do as you do not -- that is, stop and think about it. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>In other words, you can't show in any way how this says anything against Darwinism.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>As long as you can   t measure consciousness or put it in a box this is no more than a metaphysical position. I wasn   t discussing the soul as an attribute of all life, it was an example of something that is real but science cannot deal with.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>If science can't deal with it, how do you know it's real? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>There is a saying in alchemy that you must forge the soul in the crucible of the body. You are born with the seed of a soul, so it doesn   t become a concrete presence until you " cultivate it ". Most philosopher troughout history talks about the soul, I would find it odd if " soul " didn   t refer to something actual rather than an idea only.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Yes, well, I guess alchemists said a lot of things without producing anything worth talking about. Alchemy was a bust. As for souls, please bottle me one so i can examine it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It   s a method for self developement. You don   t " produce " stuff in the ordinary sense. To turn metals into gold is to be understood as a mental image not literally. BTW interesting to see you let go of your scientific seriousness when it comes to make opinions of things you don   t know about but dislike.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well, alchemists took it very literally! It's true I don't know about souls. I don't know anything about Santa Claus or unicorns either, for pretty much the same reason. As for my sense of humour, I admit I do like a good chuckle every now and then! :)<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Montalban, please edit your reply as some of the quotes have got merged / omitted, then I'll respond and delete this meaage.

You see, I noticed sometime ago that you place high importance in being correctly quoted yourself, having pointed out other peoples errors ( and mine ) quite pointedly in the past. Thats fine, but I made a mental note to appraise your own posts by your standard. I pointed the mistake out as and when I saw it. I made a polite request regarding it. Nothing off-hand here at all. And you have the audacity to then say I should be more honest. Your remark is not only completely unjustified it is quite uncalled for as well. How dare you say I have no intent to debate this issue.

I sincerely hope you take time to reflect on what you wrote in post #231 and the offense it has caused.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You made a request. I fixed it. You requested that I fix it, when I already had. You also make the statement you're unable to comment upon it until its fixed I pointed out its been fixed You then look for something else that needed fixing. There is but one error in a rather large post and you still maintain you're unable to comment on any of it, until then.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>this is what happens if you dont take genesis literally : 1. can God create matter and life? 2. if man is sinful, how come? 3. can man and God communicate? 4. did God do anything at all in the formation of the universe? 5. can we take anything in the bible to be true? 6. does the God of the bible have any physical power? 7. what does God have to do with the state of humanity as we know it? 8. does the God of the bible exist at all? without a literal interpretation of genesis, how do we answer any of these questions?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Nonsense. Many jewish and christian sects don't take creation literally and don't leap to your conclusion that this makes everything single concept in the bible is must be questionable because it contains metaphors and myths that are quaint when you considered todays knowledge.

Do you seriously claim that these sects rely on a facetious statements such as " lets not worry about it being illogical "? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>you probably wont be able to answer the questions for them, but i would be very interested to hear how they answer those questions even if the orbit does decay, doesnt it decay at an established and constant rate? isnt this factor the same from the beginning? isnt this consideration implicit in the " foundation " of the earth?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Just ask a catholic preist. Genesis is just not a significant part of their religion and debates about the science and the old testament are just distractions. Certain leaders of certain other sects of christianity / judaism / islam say the same thing http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_denom.htm The closer we get the more the sun pulls on us. It is the inverse square law. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>i read through the doctrines of the bible-based faiths. the fundamentalists / evangelicals hold that the story of genesis must be taken as literally historical, otherwise the rest of the bible has no context. this is the position i am discussing from as well, because i agree with this notion. the other biblical sects see genesis as a metaphor or some other form of literary creation, and not as a factual account. therefore they can consider the " doctrine " of evolution. the thing is, none of the paragraphs under these sects address the questions i asked. if there is anybody out there that belongs to one of the non-fundamental versions of christianity, please feel free to explain how the 8 questions i presented ( there are a lot more i can think of ) can be answered without taking genesis as literal. ( i know i discussed this with thebootfitter at length and it was a very insightful discussion, but some of the questions remained open )<br><b>S1:1-  </b>this is what happens if you dont take genesis literally : 1. can God create matter and life? 2. if man is sinful, how come? 3. can man and God communicate? 4. did God do anything at all in the formation of the universe? 5. can we take anything in the bible to be true? 6. does the God of the bible have any physical power? 7. what does God have to do with the state of humanity as we know it? 8. does the God of the bible exist at all? without a literal interpretation of genesis, how do we answer any of these questions?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>A literal interpretation leads to the conclusion that the earth does not orbit the sun. And actually, you can answer all those questions without taking a literal meaning of the word " day " or the notion that the moon is its own light source. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>how is that? where does the bible say that the earth orbits the sun? if you are refering to " He set the earth on its foundations ; it can never be moved. ", it implies that the set course and bounds and laws that keep the earth in its established place can never change. the orbit of the sun IS the earth's foundation. saying that the earth is set in its foundations doesnt mean that the earth isnt in orbit or rotation, just that it is bound by unchangeable priniciples and parameters the moon is a lesser light than the sun that governs the night. a day consists of an evening and a morning. what in this passage suggests that it is not a literal 24 hour day?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>We are talking about literal translations. MOVED means MOVED. You came up with some apologetic interpretation that redefined MOVED. " It meant something more than it literally said. " That Psalm gives no indication that it should be interpreted in such a way. The other parts are all quite literal. The moon is not a light. Actually, what is " a light? " Is a flame a light? Is a mirror reflecting that flame a light? How literally are we supposed to interpret the passage? If we interpret it as literally as possible, it is factually incorrect. The words " morning " and " evening " could be metaphors for certain eras within the larger era of " day. " In 1984, it was " Morning in America. " You can just interpret it vaguely and metaphorically like you interpreted " moved " and " foundations " above.. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>the word " moved " and " changed " is the same. there is nothing apologetic about using an obvious synonym. the term " not moved " can also refer to the stability of the earth. you insist on associating the word " move " only with motion, when all the time we use the word in different contexts to suggest different ideas. light that reflects off the moon is moonlight. there is no mental acrobatics needed to accept this. a 5 year old would tell you the same thing. oh... so now when its convenient you drag metaphors into it? the word " moved " and " changed " are common synonyms. no metaphorical interpretation or allegorical hijinks involved. similarly an evening and morning in sequence makes up a single 24 - hour day. 6 of these days in sequence ( as counted ) make up a little less than one week. the genesis account makes it quite clear. introducing ideas like " era ", " vaguely " and " metaphorical " is obviously where you start to add to genesis what isnt there<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Then why do you have such a problem with less common usage of the words " day " " morning " and " evening "? when all the time we use the word in different contexts to suggest different ideas The synonym is far from obvious and a bit of a stretch since when reading the word " move " people usually don't think mere " change, " but a change in position. But you are defining the term " a light " differently than I am defining it. I could say that light bouncing off a mirror is mirrorlight. That doesn't make the mirror " a light, " which I define as a source of light, don't you? You are the one stretching the common usage of the word " move " to make the Psalm say something that is not immediately understood when reading it. When a person reads it for the first time with no prior knowledge of astronomy, he would not read " move " as mere " change, " but as " change in position, " by far the most common usage of the word. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>what word would you use to describe the light that reflects from the moon then? you are interpreting the psalm to say that " the world doesnt move ", when it says " it can never be moved ". you take it to imply motionlessness. in reality it simply implies stability. of course we can agrue that they are both valid or invalid interpretations, but it most likely will end up pointless strange enough, i never read that passage and took it to mean that the world doesnt move, or that it is motionless...<br><b> S2:4-  </b>The article A does something in the english language. Without it " light " is the radiation that travels around. A Light is not that. It is the source of the radiation. ( edit-in reading the NIV version of genesis, it only says : Gen 1:16 - God made two great lights-the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. So actually, this interpretation doesn't call those lesser lights the sun and moon explicitly. It may only be refering to there being more light during the day and less during the night. ) No I am reading it literally " it can never be moved. " But you are right about quibbling over the meanings and interpretation of words in the Bible. It is pointless. That is strange. I'd even say unusual.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>its our human nature to go against everything God has for us. because we think were right. that gives us the immature amounts of " ego " in this world. too many people are so full of themselves that they dont even realize it until one day an 18 wheeler totals their 1985 porsche! God has to kick you in the butt one day and the more you walk away from him the harder he will hit to make you realize whats true. and why you ask does such a supposedly loving God do that? well simple i answered it in the question. because he loves us so much he sent his ONLY son to DIE for US. now thats going into the truth of God's word which you probably already know and dont believe. but see thats where ego comes and kicks you in the butt. you have the truth right in front of you and you think its wrong. why may i ask?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Is Jesus God or God's son? Both? Then God is dead. You just said God's son died. ( Oh but he really didn't die because Jesus lives. ) Anyway, you're saying that God loves us so much that he impregnated a virgin who gave birth to god ( himself ) in human form so that the human form could be killed and god could go back to heaven. How much love does it take to do this? What does that have to do with sin? edit : Oh, and the IPU created God first then God created the other unicorns. Get your theology straight man! <br><b>S1:2-  </b>what your ignorance wont let you understand is that they are all one ( the trinity ) yet seperate beings - Father son and the holy spirit God sent Jesus the man form to earth. and its takes alot of love to do this. try being beaten and whipped until your organs were hanging out and having thorns stuck in you and people spitting on you and cursing you. then on top of that endure 8 to ten hours of being stuck no nailed on a cross ( the nails going through your feet and hands ) pushing yourself up to breathe because your diapraghm no longer supports you because it is hangin out as welll. TRY THAT ON FOR LOVE!<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If they are all the same, then what kind of sacrifice did god make? No one died. No one really suffered. First, I'd have to be god, then I could handle it with infinite ease. I think it was more like days on the cross. Again, how much love does it take to not really suffer and die? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>you really are ignorant. he came in HUMAN form and he suffered just lik a human would. are you so stupid that you dont even realize that some one loves you and died for you?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well, I don't know about you but I don't think that I'm god. So if Jesus was a human like you and me, then he wasn't god. I can't remember walking on water or turning it into wine. It's not MY delimma. It christians '. He gave himself a choice? So god could chose whether he wanted to " save " mankind or not and he chose to do it? If God had chosen not to save mankind, then the human form of himself on Earth would have done what and would have had what purpose? I guess he could have just lived a long life doing parlor tricks and arguing with pharisees... The whole purpose of Jesus was so that everyone could be absolved of sin simply by eating a piece of bread broken on the altar instead of slaughtering a poor lamb on an altar. It's much more economical for large populations. Again, if Jesus was an ordinary human and not god incarnate, then he wouldn't have been able to heal the sick and do all those neat tricks. Jesus, according to your religion, was not an ordinary human. Any " suffering " was done by almighty god and wasn't suffering at all. And if Jesus died for me, then he's dead.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>And what is the basis for your analaysis? Where did that ' designer ' come from? Do you admit that chemistry happens? Do you admit organic chemistry happens? Do you understand that chemical reactions would go through a ' natural selection ' processes too? Do you understand that with a filter ( such as natural selection ), rules ( such as the way chemical reactions work ), and some random variation, you can develop complexity very easily without design?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I'm not sure why this seems to be a standard question. Why does the creator need a creator? What relevance to the origin of life debate comes from knowing where ' he ' came from? It is completely irrelevant. So then, why haven't you answered my one simple question. Though it does presume you know the process. Amino acids to protiens etc etc. That question being, where did the DNA come from? Even if this miraculous assembly occurred, where did the ' design ' come from? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Because we are talking about origins. You seem to want to ignore that question. WHy is that? Because you can't answer? It is not irrleavent. DNA could, and does devleop from RNA. That is a very well established pathway. YOu seem to think that ignorance means ' God did it '. That is not true.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Yes we are talking about origins, but the origins of life on < b > earth < / b >, therefore God's origin is NOT relevant. And no, I don't think ignorance means God did it. Ultimately, your belief is a closer match. Just because you can't prove it, doesn't mean you're not right. Or just because you can't explain it or just because the odds are impossible doesn't mean it couldn't have happened by accident. Yah! ok. Your comment DNA comes from RNA doesn't really cut it don't you think? Seriously why skirt around the issue. For example, you have all the necessary information in one single cell to make up an entire human body, or any body as the case may be. Given the ' origin of life scenario ' and if I accept simply for arguments sake that the amino acids were able to organize themselves ( oops, can't say that, it denotes intelligence ). If they accidentally fell together in a way that was organized however unlikely as described briefly above. Where does the information come from? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yes, it does cut it, actually. It has been demonstrated in the lab. There have been plenty of articles to show how that happened. It also has been shown that complex organic chemicals spontaniously organise themselves in the proper environment. I would like you to understand it isn't ' information ' in the way youy are refereing to it. Just to level set for your question, please describe what you mean by ' information '? It sounds like you are misreading the dembski's claims, which are invalid to begin with.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No, not really. It has not been demonstrated in the lab in any meaningful way. Unless of course you are referring to something other than the debunked Miller ex. ( on edit ) and BTW : ( I already gave you this as a freebee, but ) the organization of amino acids is not even in the same ball park as RNA. That really is my point in the first place isn't it. Next, : As scientists began to decode the human DNA molecule, they found something quite unexpected    an exquisite ' language ' composed of some 3 billion genetic letters Please, carry on. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You are making a lot of logical fallacies there. First of all, you are assuming that the compelxity of DNA is a language, ti is not, it is merely chemistry. Second of all, you are thinkgin that the path to DNA happened all at once.. that is not true. Some articles that might be of interest to you would be " A self-replicating peptide " in the august 1996 journal Nature. And here is a link to some ' protocells ' that can be shown to develop quite easily http://intranet.siu.edu/~protocell/photos.htm<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Well, you seem to be going backwards from where I thought our conversation was taking place, but hey ok. If you want to read a really good debate on this exact thing, please see Clives link previous. When you're done, please answer the following : Cell division even in bacteria is a complex cellular process. This raises several questions concerning protocell theory. For instance, how did a simpler cell division mechanism function? How did it lead to the complex mechanism we observe today? Are any remnants of a simpler cell division process evident in cells today? Is the cell division process irreducibly complex? ( Clive, we know you are well versed in this topic, please allow Trebor to respond of his own knowledge and understanding. )<br><b>S1:1-  </b>But I would like to add, you are wrong, I do not want to see this first hand. Also, we do not have this in fossils, if we did there would be no doubt would there. Can we agree that animals didn't take big huge leaps from fish to lion? yes, then where are all the linking fossils? No linking fossils means it didn't happen. Again, this is exactly the argument I have started on the other board. Lets continue there. The answer I am looking for you to be able to answer is this : not, can you prove the mutation of species, but can you prove the beginning of life. If you cannot prove that you have nothing.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>We have found thousands of " linking fossils ". Just because you ignore them doesn't mean they do not exist. This is drivel. The beginning of life has nothing to do with evolution, but you go beyond that by claiming we can prove nothing. This is preposterous. You are suggesting that we cannot prove say that the quadratic formula is the solution to all quadratic equations for example unless we can " prove the beginning of life ". <br><b>S1:2-  </b>My goodness, don't get your panties in a knot. All of my posts in this matter have said exactly that they have nothing to do w / one another. Did you just get here? And no, what I am saying is that life or abiogenesis is so complex as to require a designer. That it could not have been a freak accident, after accident after accident. Or at the very least, I was trying to convince some people that it is at least a possibility, but they didn't even get what ID was so I gave up on that for a while.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This is my 997th post, the majority of them in the " Creation vs Evolution " section. No, I didn't just get here. The problem you have is that your claim that " life or abiogenesis is so complex as to require a designer " is a simple statement of personal incedulity, ie you find it impossible to image how life could have started without a designer. I have no such failure of imagination and can imagine how life could have started without a designer. Both positions are simple personal opinion though as we do not know, and probably never will know, how life started. Unfortunately people holding the same opinion as you try to promote ID as more than just an opinion. Yes it is a possiblity, but so is the idea that life started when the giant spaghetti monster crapped upon the Earth whilst cruising through the solar system. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You've not only missed the sarcasm, but obviously the point.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Perhaps you need to learn to express yourself better then? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>No, I'd say you need to take Comprehension 101.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Perhaps I do. However could you actually improve your ability to express yourself first by explaining what " take Comprehension 101 " means in English please? I'll then be able to take it and thus comprehend you. Thanks awfully.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>If you are not an IDer and not a creationist then what are you?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Not a label, you? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Some how I knew you couldn    t answer the question.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Lol, I've answered the question a dozen times ; you just don't like the answer because it doesn't fit into your false dichotomy. I am a human being. Want to ask am more specific question? If a chuckle is all one can manage that is... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>YES, are you man or woman?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I have given that answer on this forum before, so you may find it on your own ; but I do not see what possible relevance it could have so I will not answer. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Yes freedom, just like every question ever asked you. Frankly I don't care what you are, I just wanted to see if you would give out personal information, apparently you already have.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>That a bit of an extrapolation if you ask me :p Why? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>It indicates that you are narcissistic.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Does giving it out mean I'm narcissistic or keeping it hidden? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Giving it out means you are narcissistic.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Ah, well it did come up for somewhat of a valid reason before ( unlike your curiosity on my psychology ). Do you play these kind of games with people you meet in real life? If I had given you the answer you would have called me a narcissist ; I didn't and you implied that ' just as always ' I am unwilling to answer questions in good faith. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>I am not curious, I already knew you were narcissistic, that    s obvious, I just wanted you to confirm it.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>Your desire to confirm my psychology is not any better a reason, but congratulations you've once again extricated yourself with a well timed insult.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The big bang is actually the sole piece of incontrovertible evidence that there is something besides a random universe. We are intelligent and we exist in the universe so intelligence is a attribute of the universe. By the concept of the prime mover either the universe and all it's attributes always existed or something created ( moved ) it. The big bang is direct evidence that it did not always exist and is not infinite. Creationism fully accounts for all possible scenarios, that is why it is foolish to attempt disprove it or pit it against science. I have literally heard the idea that God created the earth some thousands of years ago and all evidence you see to the contrary was placed there by God as a test of people's faith. Now what are you going to say to that anyone?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Your arguments are a logical fallacy known as an argument from ignorance ( and also an argument from personal incredulity. ) An argument from ignorance is that a premise is true because it has not been proven untrue, or is untrue because it has not been proven true. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I know the fallacy. I have not used that argument.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Incontrovertible evidence? Yeah, right. Aside from the obvious logical fallacy I am wondering what exactly you mean by,    a random universe    and why would that be undesirable? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>a random universe being one in which all interactions of energy and matter were random because all vectors were random. The big bang indicates it is ordered, we should have expected such by the fact that the behavior of particles and fields are ordered. No we don't? What about 13.9 billion years ago at the center of the known universe? The big bang What you are talking about is a static state universe, one that existed for all time, it doesn't match the data.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Where is the center of the known universe?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The big bang is actually the sole piece of incontrovertible evidence that there is something besides a random universe.

I have literally heard the idea that God created the earth some thousands of years ago and all evidence you see to the contrary was placed there by God as a test of people's faith. Now what are you going to say to that anyone?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>' Intelligence ' is an attribute of the current universe. Since humans are currently the only known instance of ' intelligence ', then prior to the existence of humans ' intelligence ' was quite possibly not an attribute of the universe. ' Wetness ' is an attribute of water but we wouldn't consider this same attribute in relation to hydrogen or oxygen, nor to their constituent nuclear components. Emergent properties happen. No, according to modern cosmological theories, not even the strong or weak nuclear forces existed at the very beginning of the big bang. The big bang is evidence that our local region of the universe did not always exist. Beyond that one has to say " I don't know ", though several recent cosmological hypotheses ( e.g., quantum loop gravity ) do strongly suggest events prior to the big bang, but not in our local region of the universe. Yes, brains in a vat, the Matrix, and Last Thursdayism are unprovable. That is why science has been so successful - it only deals with naturalistic explanations for naturalistic phenomena. An unconstrained supernatural force can provide an answer for anything ( fossils in the ground, complexity in organisms, etc. ) but will provide an explanation for nothing. Science is in the business of providing explanations - philosophy is down the hall and on your left. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>If the universe existed for an infinite amount of time then the property of intelligence as emerged an infinite number of times before and after the current time frame. Having what to do with what I said? Hypothesis aren't evidence, perhaps that mistake is why you believe in evolution? Anyway you can keep chaining stuff up but a random start event is inconsistent with what we know, so I still say that something has existed forever and it is not any part of the universe we are aware of. Hehe I can't tell a difference between my philosophy and science, it is all knowledge that is gained through non-contradictory inquiry into reality.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I was responding to your use of the word ' incontrovertible '. The standard cosmological model is based on general relativity and it is a known fact that GR breaks down at t =0. At t =0 the big bang was most likely a quantum event, and yes, there are theoretical physicists working on hypotheses to explain what happened at t =0. Given that they are currently only hypotheses I don't think the word " incontrovertible " is warranted. And yet quantum physics tends to be very contradictory, at least to our perceptions. Acausal events happen. A particle can be in two places at the same time. A particle can disappear and reappear in a different location without traversing that distance. And et cetera. Since the beginning of our local universe occurred at quantum levels, I would be cautious about drawing philosophical conclusions based on our macro-world experiences. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It is incontrovertible, there is no explanation for something appearing from nothingness. Then it tends to be untrue. I don't believe that is possible. I do not believe this is true either. Really, does the random appearance of quarks seem less inexplicable than the random appearance of protons or atoms?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Except that it's not. Your PC, DVD player, cellphone, microwave oven, etc. are all built on the principles of quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is the most accurate predictive theory of physics ever devised, accurate to how ever many decimal places that can be measured. That it says many things that are completely counter-intuitive is irrelevant : nature does not have to behave in intuitive ways. Whether you believe it or not is also irrelevant. The above have been theorized, predicted, tested, observed, and measured. If you want more information you can google ' zero point energy ', ' Casimir effect ', ' quantum tunneling ', ' superposition ', etc. Or pick up an intro to quantum mechanics in layman's terms. I don't know what you trying to say with the above..... Edit to add ( pre-emptively ) : Also google up " Bell's theorem ", the testing of which strongly indicates there are no local hidden variables ' below ' quantum mechanics, and thus quantum mechanics is an accurate description.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No. I'm saying that ask a dozen experts and they'll as likely come up with 12 different results in placing them into different categories.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>But, of course, monty completely misses the point. Why am I not surprised? The difficulty in precisely seperating the various fossil skulls above into species or even Genera would be what you would expect if evolution had occurred. The evolution of an ancestral species into one or more descendent species would be very confusing if you had only a few sample specimens from hundreds of generations. However this sort of confusion shouldn't be possible if you accept creationism. Homo sapiens are one kind, chimpanzees are another kind. How could there have been individuals who shared characteristics of both kinds? Despite different opinions from different experts, I'm sure that none of them would claim the Australopithecus africanus skulls are chimpanzees ' skulls, or that the Homo habilis skulls are modern humans ' skulls. And of course it's amusing to note that the creationist " experts " can't even agree amongst themselves which are human and which are ape skulls. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>What I'm saying is that some of these skulls which you might say are ' links ' are in fact just small human skulls... as fitting in with the normal range of human skull size. Also, is that the ' offical ' definition of ' kind '?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You're completely clueless, aren't you monty? There is much more distinguishing a human from a chimpanzee or gorilla skull than size. Here's a hint. Check the link which Lurch provided. Is sample A only a small version of sample N? Is sample I a large case of A or a small case of N? BTW " kind " is a meaningless creationist term. Feel free to provide your own perculiar definition if you are fame. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Clueless? You mean you're talking about chimps and monkeys, and I'm not. I responded to someone mentioning that the skulls are not like any creature alive, now you're talking about apes. I mentioned ' missing link ' as a clue. We are not descended from monkeys and chimps. I was asserting that with skull size, if you line them up, some people will say that the smaller skulls are more primitive, and that you can't use this as a measure ; a number of people will categorise them one way, a number as another. There is no agreement. As to ' kind ' it wasn't I who raised it. Tis a pitty you're so full of hate that you rebuke me for mentioning it, and fail to raise it with the person who did. I merely asked for their definition of ' kind '. Oh, that was you wasn't it? Oops, no wonder you're upset!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>monty, you have been provided with this selection of fossil skulls. Which are the ones that are small human skulls misclassified? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Firstly, please address the issue of ' kind '. Are you now saying that your use of it was wrong or do you have a definition of it? You did get a tad insulting about what you in fact raised.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>monty, " kinds " is a creationist term which has flexible / imprecise meaning. Despite its meaninglessness, creationists include it in their " explanations " of the diversity of life eg. some claim that humans are a different kind to apes. Enough of that red herring. Back to the skulls. Which ones have been misclassified because they are small human skulls? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>a ) YOU were the one who raise it b ) YOU were insulting when I asked you to define it.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Red herring. Back to the skulls Which ones have been misclassified because they are small human skulls? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>You mean it's only a red herring because you raised it as an agressive point but then realise your mistake?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Back to the skulls -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Originally Posted by monty The problem with skull finds is that when they line them up - by cranium capacity - there's no agreement as to where the line can be drawn between those that are human and those that are ape, which are in between etc. And the modern human displays such a wide range of skull size now - from pygamy adults all the way up. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Which ones have been misclassified because they are small human skulls? <br><b>S1:7-  </b>Why do you persist? Obviously I'm not going to deal with things the way you want, and you're not going to deal with things the way I want. However, I'm sure you'll want to drop a last word on the matter like it's only me who does this :)<br><b> S2:7-  </b>monty fails to put up, again. I wonder if he will shut up, after he withdraws his assertion about small human skulls. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>See! You make an assertion about ' kind ' and don't want to deal with that I knew you were only wanting to point score.<br><b> S2:8-  </b>I've heard all sort of inconsistent definitions of " kinds " from creationists. The only consistency is that they claim that humans are a kind on their own and distinct from all other linving creatures. What's your definition of " kind "? But back to the challenge : Which skull fossils have been misclassified because they are small human skulls?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Attempting to invalidate your opponents argument time and time again is not a very good debate tactic. Ripskar did indeed offer up a counter argument for the argument " you can't create something from nothing ", issuing the links he posted. The explanation for how QM relates to and counters the argument is within the links themselves. One link even addressed the initial argument directly. On you and ID ; it's clear from that link that you were arguing in defense of ID. Whether that's indicative of you being a supporter of ID is negligable. If I may chime in ; everyone on this forum knows that you argue for some altered view of IC, and every source available will tell you that IC is an ID argument - the argument was conceived by a proponent of ID ; IC is clearly used as an argument to support ID... Again, your view doesn't necessarily plop you into ID territory. You've rather convolutedly explained it to me once before, and I accept that if you say you aren't a supporter of ID, then fine, you aren't.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Invalidate or falsify is the point of debate, but I have not invalidated anything ; I have merely pointed out the lack of argument. I didn't read them, I know the statement cannot be countered rationally and would just as well see ripskar attempt to do so for it was he who's claim sparked my indignance. Pointing out false arguments is something I do all the time. I have done it to local creationist, to pretty much everyone. I am not an advocate of everything. That's like saying arguing against murder makes you a christian because christians condemn murder. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Falsification and invalidation are two methods that can be used in debate if you can, amongst many others. Thus far, I have not seen you apply any method other than attempted invalidation. This is a perfect example, in that one argument was pitched ( you can't get something from nothing ) and Ripskar countered that argument with the links he used that you neglected to read, referencing QM as a source of acquiring something from " nothing ". This is a perfectly valid argument, one in which you attempt to invalidate by claiming that he doesn't have an argument in the first place - something I've seen you do many times. See, using invalidation against a valid argument is not only ineffective, but it makes you look really silly. Ripskar referenced a number of links ; if anything, you are the one who has not developed a counter argument to QM in response to " the fallacy of something out of nothing " ; you've just not bothered to read his argument and then claimed he doesn't have one. Do you see how silly this looks??<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Lol, Nothing | Define Nothing at Dictionary.com. In other words I know it cannot be countered because such would be a contradiction. The statement ' a universe from nothing ' is a contradiction, the best that can be said is ' a universe '. If you think QM can dissolve logic why don't you make the argument, surely if your links made the case you could summarize it here. No, attempting one of those are the only two ways to attack an opponents argument, the rest are informal fallacies. I've said my opponent has no argument many times because many times they do not. Most of the time they blather for a bit with informal fallacies and emotional appeals and then quit. Lol, interesting way you phrased that. Try to invalidate a valid argument, yes that won't work. There are only two possible natures of his links, a description of QM which is in no way applicable to the logic of the original statements ; or some mystical rhetorical maze such as the one displayed recently with databed and the 1 - 1 = 0 equivocation to NULL = ~ NULL <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Oh yea, cause opinion based arguments don't exist, to name one. This is the problem with your arguments. You think invalidating someone's argument is the only way to provide one of your own. However, you can only invalidate someone's argument if that argument is... invalid, in the same way you can only falsify someone's argument if it is false and you can show that it is false. I actually read the links Ripskar posted, and not only did they address the issue ( falsifying your first assertive claim ), but it made complete sense to me, knowing nothing about QM to start with ; all was logical and almost based off of fundamental principles of QM ( and falsifying your second assertive claim ). You're still trying to invalidate Ripskar's argument by saying he doesn't have one when you haven't even read his argument.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It's the only way to provide a counter argument yes. Quite right. No, I didn't read his link ; I'll read any argument he cares to make. If you think QM ' counters ' something like " what came before time? ", and " something can't come from nothing " I will readily agree you know nothing about it. Still waiting for your argument, yours. Nothing is defined as the lack of existence, so yes there is no such thing as nothing. There is a concept nothing but that's all. Nothing = no thing. I must be a psychic 1 - 1 = NULL :p A definition of quantum vacuum lacking any particles or waves or anything else.... except virtual particles and minute bursts of energy :p<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Prove it! Prove any of the assumptions you make here. Prove absolutely that sponges were the earliest forms of life and that Jellyfish followed next. These are convenient assumptions based of deductions which are based on more assumptions. You have no evidence of any of it.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>First you prove ABSOLUTELY that your GOD exists. Or alternatively PROVE ABSOLUTELY that the sun will " rise " in the sky tomorrow. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>More obfuscation chemist? You know that you're nothing but a XXXX hard who is making huge unprovable and unsupportable assumptions so just vacate and derail the debate rather than simply support what you say happened more than 400 million years ago on a dead planet void of all life. I mean, you speak with such all knowing confidence, surely you must have proof of what you assume happened, dont you chemist? No matter how you slice it, you believe that from the simplest single celled life form cam creatures with organs, limbs, nervous systems and brains that even developed the ability to reason and be self aware. All through RANDOM MUTATIONS. By accident according to your logic. Forget the odds of such diverse and complex life happening by accident and you still have the problem of all this happening by accident in only 400 million years. The best objective minds don't believe such incredible calculations could result accidently in 400 trillion years without some intelligent help.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Nope you left out the key process of natural selection applied to such variability and that makes the process non-random although it remains undirected. And yes with that modification I do believe that life on earth diversified from one or a few primitive common ancestors from evolutionary processes not greatly different from that of NDS. I have no prblem with it - apparently you do. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Oh that's right, I always forget that sticky little term of Natural Selection. But tell me chemist, before any living organism existed, what was there to Naturally Select? Can you clarify that little conflict? How does random mutation which is not really random, even though they have always called it random, encourage natural selection when nothing existed to begin with that was capable of producing life? And more importantly, how do you go to sleep at night knowing that only a lunatic would take the existing evidence and consider it reasonable or rational at all? Unless you actually do have a Time Machine and have physically gone back as far as you had to to actually see the process of new life taking place, then jumped ahead in 2 million year increments to see the process work. Without that happening, you are hoping that what is absolutely unprovable is true, but you can live another hundred years and you will be no closer to knowing what actually happened before any life existed on Earth in the primordial past and how it applies to life as we know it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Non-living chemical systems. What else? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Then you readilly admit that life as we know it came from non living chemical reactions. So from non living matter came life? How can you possibly believe this and have a hard time believing in a Supernatural Being called Yahweh, Master of Time and Space? He's easier to believe in than we came from rocks. I mean, even you would have to admit that rocks came from non-living chemical systems too, right? So why couldn't we have come from rocks? Note to Admin, my siggy about rocks and evo doesn't sound so radical now does it. Even chemist agrees its possible. How can a true statement be offensive?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Yes I do and I base my belief on the properties of matter as observed in chemistry and physics. And look at it logically at one time there was no life, later on there was, life had to come from non-life. Is it really easier to believe that some eternal all-powerful being decided to create life one day than it is to believe that life is a chemical and physical effect which can arise due to physical laws? And yes non-living rocks would seem to have come from non-living precursors - does that bother you? The simple matter of fact would appear to be that I have a reasonable understanding of how chemistry works and what chemistry can do while you do not. Thus you put in place a mysterious ( and unnecessary ) being to serve as a comforter for your ignorance of the core knowledge here. This is not uncommon with humans, they have may strange and irrational beliefs, but most try at least to remedy the situation by a process we call learning.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It proves that there are enough bible believing christians who are also working geologists and Earth Scientists to have an association of like minded members. Are you going to insist that among all of these christian geologists, that not one of them are YECs who work in the field of oil exploration? With that said, I have at least proven that there are enough christian geologists to justify having a professional association. Neither you nor the obvious child have even tried to show that no christian geologists work in the field of oil exploration. Again you read into my statement in order to attribute something to me which I never said. Show where I have equated YEC with christianity as a whole, in context, if you can.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>A simple analogy that comes to mind regarding YEC and Christianity is the distinction between squares and rectangles. Rectangles are polygons with four sides with all internal angles equal to 90 degrees. Squares are rectangles with the further criterion that all sides are of equal length. Accordingly, all squares are rectangles, but all rectangles are not squares. Similarly, all YEC's are Christians, but all Christians are not YEC's. Archangel may have never said, explicitly, that YEC is equivalent to Christianity, but he has been VERY SLOPPY and essentially uses the terms interchangeably. I suspect he does this intentionally to created a straw-man argument. Would ANYONE argue that ALL Christian geologists are hindered because of their religious beliefs? The proposition is absurd! MANY highly functional and successful scientists are Christians. Would a YEC geologist be hindered? Yes! This is the point that several posters have been trying to make. I have not read ANY posts suggesting that Christians, in general, could not be effective geologists. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>This statement proves that you agree that the obvious childs premise of this thread is both dishonest and blatantly inaccurate, as well as an unproven assumption. Secondly, I have neither been sloppy nor have I attempted to create a straw-man argument in any way. I have used a hypothetical and my personal beliefs in order to make as clear as possible my position on this issue. All of which you seem unwilling to, or incapable of grasping. I believe that YEC Geologists are not disadvantaged at all in doing their jobs in oil exploration based on their YEC beliefs. I can't be anymore clear than that, and still await your sides evidence that no Oil exploration company has ever hired a YEC Christian. The fact is that it is an impossible question to answer since companies can't even inquire as to ones religion during the hiring process in this country. But the obvious child has now run away since he can't back up any of his claims with actual evidence at all. Why Tester, don't you point out his straw-man which this thread is based upon? Now, I need to run to Salem to pick up my macbook from the Apple Store. See you on the flip side. :)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Because I think you misinterpreted his point. See below : Archangel : I can see why you're protesting the thread opener. I wish I had addressed this first. I interpreted Obvious Child's opener to argue that oil companies don't specifically attempt to hire YEC geologists -- not that they never hire geologists who happen to be YEC. That is, major oil companies seek oil using plate tectonics, stratigraphy and faunal succession, all of which are incompatible with YEC. That does not mean that an individual Young-Earth Creationist would be unable to perform a specific duty within that company. Certainly no oil company would inquire about a candidate's religious beliefs. A Young-Earth Creationish would, however, be at a disadvantage in terms of understanding the big picture, and the principles of Young-Earth Creationism are certainly not useful for finding oil ( and therefore not desirable to oil companies ). Perhaps Obvious Child will clarify? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I'm typing this from the Apple store on my newly refurbished macbook in order to give the new keyboard a test run. In response to your defense of the obvious child, you give him too much credit for actually thinking through his reasons for posting this thread. And the chances are good that he wont clarify his OP because he knows his original intent was based on a straw-man argument which can't be proven. But I have proven that since an association of christian geologists exists that there are many geologists who are committed christians. And your opinion that YEC Geologists would be at some disadvantage is also just that ; your opinion. Nobody has posted one iota of evidence verifying that claim at all. And in spite of your attempt to clarify what child intended to say, his opening post is clear and direct in claiming that " according to the Last I checked, no credible fossil fuel firm hired YEC geologists. That means he actually checked. Why wont he post that evidence for us all to see? It's because he lied and never checked anything at all and the premise of this thread is based on his own anti-YEC / christian bigotry.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Congrats! Apparently we have something in common Well, I'm sincere in how I interpreted what he wrote, and I honestly believe that is what he meant. Again, I don't think ANYONE has intended to claim otherwise. I think you erroneously interpreted the original post. I'm baffled you're claiming victory for " proving " that some, perhaps many, geologists are Christians. It is simply a matter of fact that was never under debate. Unless someone speaks up to explicitly affirm support of the idiotic counter position ( i. e, that there are no Christian or even YEC geologists ), you're clearly fighting a man of straw. Yes, they have. Seriously. Are you serious? This is a VERY COMMON figure of speech.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>About half the thread was deleted over last night ( it was well into page two when I posted ) after I got the Admin to look over it and get rid of the extraneous posts. I don't recall a post by him, but there could have been one. ETA : Although given that Roesgen didn't tell the truth about my own post there, if Symbiote did post it could very well have not said what Roesgen claims.....<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You are the one who does not tell the truth. You characterized the thread as mainly a lover's feud between Arch and OC and that's why you reported it. Given that OC started the thread for that reason, that makes calling it a " troll thread " a fair description. Symbiote said something to the effect of what is the point of this thread? If you want to continue your dishonesty and deny that, then that's your problem. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That is correct - a majority of the posts there were spam between Archie and OC - the Admin removed those posts. It was not the whole thread, nor the thread itself - just a number of subsequent posts IN the thread. I'm sorry it seems you don't like it when your own rules are applied to yourself - that's just tough, isn't it? It may or may not be a fair description. That is not what is being talked about here. What is being talked about here is YOUR false claim that that is the description I gave of it in my post, when I gave no such description. I did not deny nor accept that Symbiote posted that. I said I could not recall if Symbiote had posted, but said he very well could have. Please do not misrepresent my post by claiming that I denied it when I did no such thing. Especially since you have been complaining about O _ C misrepresenting you and Archie in posts. It isn't that fun when you get a taste of your own poison, is it?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I interpret your comments to mean that you referred to the thread as a troll thread. I showed why. It's tough for you to be consistent with yourself. Your comments describing the thread can be characterized as calling it a " troll thread. " I stand by that. Can you show me where I verbatim said GiantOreo used the words troll thread to describe your thread? Please do not misrepresent my post by claiming that I said that you denied what Symbiote said. Repeating what I've said to OC and pretending that I haven't passed my own tests won't make it so. My characterization of your comments was accurate, OC's are not. I pass my test, he does not. It's not poison to me since my comments were accurate. It's plenty fun. Give me more. :) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And I showed why it is not rational to interpret them to mean that, given that no such word was used, nor was the entire thread itself described as anything - merely a number of posts in it ( which have since been deleted ). As I never once used the word troll, nor did I characterize the entire thread as anything, no, they CANNOT be characterized by that. You just posted the quote in your above post. Here is, word for word what you said : In what reality is that NOT saying that I denied what Symbiote said? You stated that he said something and then said it was my problem if I wanted to CONTINUE to DENY that. Quit squirming. It's unbecoming. So you don't care about your hypocrisy? Figures.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I showed why it is rational to interpret it to mean that. You described the thread as being " filled with spam " relating to an " ongoing feud " between the thread starter and the person whose comments were the target of the opening post. That's a troll thread. The fact that you did not use the actual word " troll " is irrelevant. Terms can have a synonymous meaning without being the exact same word. The only way you can prove that I misrepresented your thread is if you can show that I said Giant Oreo verbatim called it a " troll thread. " Can you show this? Again, notice the word " if. " I said " if " you want to do that. If means that you may decide to do something or not. Given that you may decide to continue to be dishonest or not is a true statement, the comment I made is true. You can continue to be dishonest or not - true statement. You aren't capable of making a persuasive enough lie to make me squirm. Don't flatter yourself. I don't care about that since I don't have it. You obviously don't care about your dishonesty though.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>where is the intelligent mind that receives and processes this information? would it be the dna itself is the mind of the tree?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Don't be silly, trees don't have minds. Fancy thinking that tree's could know when to drop their own leaves. They would have to process information to achieve that. As peddler has explained, trees cannot process information. It's god's little helper, the leaf angel, that is the intelligent mind that creates information from temperature and tells trees to drop their leaves by downloading a new program into their DNA. It's hardly rocket science you know. Show me an example of a tree writing to the weather forcasters asking for the current temperature. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>actually, the leaf angel could not communicate anything to the tree, because that would also require the tree having a mind to receive the message. it must be that the leaf angel miraculously cuts off nutrient supply from each leaf on each tree in that temperate zone. the tree cannot respond to stimuli at all, for that matter, because the information ( such as direction of light source, soil moisture content, presence of nutrients, etc ) cannot be detected unless an intelligent mind is present to receive and process the information and take the appropiate action in response. those trees must have lots of angels...<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You are confused. DNA isn't matter. It is information and so cannot be matter. The scientific law says so. I'm right if you say I'm wrong. That's also scientific law. Show me an example of an elephant talking to DNA. DNA is the media for transmitting the message from the leaf angel to the leaf. The leaf doesn't receive the message as it isn't a mind. That is the scientific law. Show me an example of a leaf listening to a music station on the radio and singing along. Don't ask me how the DNA tells the leaf to fall off. It just does. If I could tell you that, I'd win a Nobel prize. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>yes, but scientists are biased, therefore science is wrong. the only explanation left is that some undetectable mind within the leaf must exist in order to recieve and process this information. the leaf must have a mind, otherwise, how would it be able to know when to fall. it isnt rocket science you know. show me an example of matter creating music you must be an atheist because you believe that a mind must be detectable for it to exist. have you ever seen a leaf thinking?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Actually science = knowledge. But scientists have no knowledge for they lie to us about evolution which is wrong by their own scientific laws of wrongness. Please give me an example of a scientist who can prove Darwin found limitless transitional fossil finches. Exactly and the only mind intelligent enough to be in every leaf is the God of the Bible thus proving Genesis is fact and evolution is a lie of Satan. No you must be an athiest because you believe you cannot not detect undectable intelligent minds within dead leaves. Even a four year old can understand that. Surely you can. This isn't science you know. Does a dead leaf know it's dead? Show me an example of a million dead leaves writing the complete works of Shakespear in less than a million years.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Start with a certain sequence of dna? Interesting. I would like to see that experiment. It would certainly win the nobel prize. So your contention is that dna is not media for information just a lucky mess of chemicals?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Unless there's something very odd about you, you started as a sequence of DNA! You do know basic biology, right? Reproduction? DNA in an egg, cell division, all that stuff? As for whether DNA is a lucky mess or not, that's completely irrelevant to this discussion. It's still just a chemical, which you certainly can't deny, and the development of an organism is based on a series of chemical reactions, centered about that chemical. Change the chemical and you change what reaction you're going to get. Different chemical, different chemical reactions. The entire concept of information is moot, regardless of how you define it. It simply doesn't enter in to the question of why different DNA gives you different organsims. It's all chemistry. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It is hard enough for me to take this seriously as it is. I will refrain from my facetious comments if you will refrain from asking me if have found out the stork was a myth. Fair enough? It is a chemical that has embedded in it the information of life. You make it sound like drain cleaner or something. I agree DNA is a chemical but that the development of an organism is a chemical reaction I do not. Cell division is a bit more complicated than making mustard gas. The information system of dna is amazingly complex. We are made of chemicals but to think life is just random and undirected chemical reactions I find absurd. Why does DNA have a code if information is irrelevant-what is it's purpose? Science has no real idea what life is, to say it is just chance chemical reactions is based on worldview not evidence. If it was we could create life. if you are right we are all just a colossal chemical accident. Then you would be one accident describing the accident that created it. How could you trust your own thoughts? What purpose would life have? It saddens me to think people really feel that way about themselves. What joy could life have, what hope?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Fair enough. I'm sorry, but it really sounds like you are the one basing an opinion on a worldview and not fact. The idea that life, at it's core, is chemistry makes you sad, so you refuse to accept it. If this isn't the case, if your opinion isn't based on emotion, there's a simple way for you to demonstrate it. All you have to do is answer this question. If the development of an organism isn't based on chemistry, then what is it based on? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I'm sorry but I thought you were the smart one here. What do you think I am saying it is based on? Information. The chemistry is the media. And you say I am dense. What is the topic of this post?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well if we both think it than it must be true! Actually, I don't believe I have called you dense yet, but I'm becoming more willing to. Information can't actually do anything. It can't control a process. And chemistry is not a media, it's a collection of rules for how molecules interact. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're trying to hide behind semantics here. So, I'm going to ask again, and please don't be terse or sarcastic. Feel free to use lots and lots of words. If it helps for you to think that I'm not the smart one here than go ahead. Now, here's the question. If the development of an organism is not governed by the rules of chemistry, than what is it governed by? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>At least you have a sense of humor. A rare quality here indeed. Chemicals are media in this case as the biotic code is written into them is it not? Information cannot by itself do anything I agree. However no purposeful action is possible without it. Do you agree? I did not mean to imply I believe that I am smarter than you what I meant was I thought you were the brightest of the people I have discussed this with here. I still do. I was a bit surprised you missed my point entirely but it was probably my poor communication skills that caused the problem. Although you disagree with me you are not dishonest with semantics like so many others. I apologize for the remark. What I believe is God imparted the genetic code, which is still only partially understood, to man and to all the animals at the time of their creation. It does use chemistry to transfer the information to build cells and physical structures. Exactly how God does this I do not know but anyone who claims to truly understand how life came about with certainty I believe is delusional. Even Dr. Crick said it was a near miracle. I believe it was a complete miracle.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>peddler's argument is that information that living things consists of, such as dna sequences and neuro-electrical impulses, require the input of an intelligent being in order for it to exist. his definition of information is " something that requires a mind to create or recieve it ". the sequence of base pairs that make up a dna strand existed long before they were discovered. in fact, there is no information that we know today that didnt exist before it was known. peddler also argues that the information about what is at the bottom of the sea or in outerspace or in habib's deli hotdogs does not exist, because it is universally unknown. would you agree? this argument is no less than that about schrodinger's ( sp ) cat. the cat and the poison doesnt exist unless there is someone to observe it. would you agree? is there a difference between " we have no information about x " and " there exists no information about x "?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I don't recall saying neuro-electrical impulses were information. They are material and cannot be information. If all matter was information what would we need books or language for? If you delete the hard drive on your computer does it weigh less? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>neuro-electric impulses are material? if your brain stops transmitting neuro-electric impulses do you weigh less? i never said matter was information. electric impulses are not matter<br><b> S2:2-  </b>yes they are professor. All matter is made up of atoms, and atoms are made up of smaller particles. The three main particles making up an atom are the proton, the neutron and the electron. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>electric impulses are not electrons. all matter contains eletrons. not all matter can exhibit electric impulses. so again, electric impulses are not matter.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You missed your era. You should have been a beatnick. Let me think of all possible non material entities. Information. Conciousness. The human spirit. God. I may have missed one but talking to you gives me a headache. Electricity in any form is matter. Heres a hint - electricity is made up of atoms. All matter is made up of atoms. There are non-material impulses, they usually get you into trouble. Electric impulses are made up of electrons. This is not rocket science. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>eletric impulses are caused by the movement of electrons, like wind is caused by the movement of air. you fail to see the difference between electrons and electricity. you probably wont be able to tell the difference between air and wind, or the sun and heat, or water and current. all forms of energy are non-material. in fact, forms of energy are the only non-material things that can be observed and measured. things like consciousness and God are concepts ; they cannot be observed or measured. if you'd like to classify them as non-material thats not a problem and i never said you belive in majic. you seem to also have a serious inability to match posters with what they actually said<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Electronic impulses are the movement of electrons. Electrons are material things. Einstein derived the Equation E = M* C* C. It is well known as part of the relativity theory. This theory states that all matter is energy and all energy is matter. accelerator ( particle accelerator ) - A machine that accelerates charged sub-atomic particles ( electrons, protons, deuterons, etc. ) to high speed and energy. These highspeed particles are often bombarded upon a suitable target and uncharged high-energy radiation is subsequently produced ( neutrons or x-rays ). <br><b>S1:5-  </b>matter and energy are convertable, but matter is not energy. the theory of relativity requires matter to be destroyed in order for energy to be released. if the matter is destroyed, then it doesnt exist anymore this could easily turn into another definition joust of what is non-material. so i wont labor this but end it before it starts lets see if i can go over your assertions again information is non-material <-- agreed for the discussion's sake a mind is non-material <-- inserted by me only a mind can create information <-- assertion you failed to backup dna contains information <-- based on your application of the definition dna is matter <-- inserted by fishpower ( i think ) the dna sequence is a code <-- your interpretation dna sequences are not processed by a mind <-- inserted by me how then, can you demonstrate that the dna sequence is information under your preferred defintion, if you fail to demonstrate how it is created, communicated, or processed by a mind? what mind creates, communicates and processes the " information " in dna?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Lets just agree electricity is not information - fair enough? I agree that a mind is non material. That only a mind can create information is a self evident truth. Give me an example of how information can be created without intelligence? DNA is a code. Codes cannot create themselves and it has a purpose. The Sender and receiver understand the code. Therfore it is information. DNA is matter-the information embedded in the code is non-material. We don't know how DNA sequences are processed. We know they are processed which proves the sender and receiver are intelligent. Bees exchange information but they do not have a mind in the human sense. That is a straw man. Do you know how information is created in your own mind? Do you know how a bee thinks? If you read a book and have no idea who the author is the book itself is still empirical evidence that there was one. I don't believe in God is not a scientific argument but I think that is what you are saying. Who ever created the code was infinitely more intelligent than we, that is what the observable evidence says. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>factual information cannot be created, no matter how intelligent the mind is. you have not given me a single example of 1 bit of factual informatino that you have created. you have not demonstrated the link between dna " code " and any " intelligent mind ". what " intelligent mind " creates or uses this dna " code "? that dna " codes " are processed does not prove that there is a sender or reciever involved. this is your assertion. at least identify the sender and reciever. and your point about bees defeats your own argument. if bees, and even pollinating flowers, can send and receive information without a mind, wouldnt that mean that a mind is not required for sending and receiving information? no i do not. i have never created factual information in my mind, and neither have you. please prove me wrong everything in this paragraph consists of arguments nobody made. you are creating arguments and easily defeating them. that is what a strawman is<br><b>S1:1-  </b>information is simply facts about something. the facts about the world exist whether an intelligent mind creates or recieves them. dont you get that? its not rocket science<br><b> S2:1-  </b>He " doesn't get it " because he doesn't agree with your definition. Simply being emphatic about your definition doens't mean that everyone will agree with it. Most dictionary definitions do say that facts have to be received by someone to be considered information, so I'm afraid that common usage is against you here. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>peddler's argument is that information that living things consists of, such as dna sequences and neuro-electrical impulses, require the input of an intelligent being in order for it to exist. his definition of information is " something that requires a mind to create or recieve it ". the sequence of base pairs that make up a dna strand existed long before they were discovered. in fact, there is no information that we know today that didnt exist before it was known. peddler also argues that the information about what is at the bottom of the sea or in outerspace or in habib's deli hotdogs does not exist, because it is universally unknown. would you agree? this argument is no less than that about schrodinger's ( sp ) cat. the cat and the poison doesnt exist unless there is someone to observe it. would you agree? is there a difference between " we have no information about x " and " there exists no information about x "?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>And because you don't like where that definition will lead, you come up with your own definition of information that specifically does not require a recipient. And so this debate has no chance of getting anywhere, because everyone is using self-serving definitions. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>this is not my own definition. i am saying that the sequence of base pairs in a strand of dna, or whatever information we'd like to refer to, exists whether we humans ( or whatever intelligent beings youd like to refer to ) are aware. the temperature of the south pole was 40 below zero before thermometers were invented. the speed of light was the same before there were eyes to see it. facts are independent of observation or cognizance. i'll ask again : " we have no information about x " " no information about x exists " is there any difference between these 2 statements?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>That depends on what your definition of " information " is. A point which I have yet to see any concensus on, because everyone wants to tune the defintion to support their argument. And by the way, I have no interest in actually taking sides here. I could just see that this discussion was going to bog down really quickly, and was hoping to give it a shove to see if it can actually get past the " bickering about defintions " stage.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Stop telling us it flows uphill then. We have both a good idea of how the bee's communication system works and how it evolved. Evolution not only is a possible answer, it's the only currently viable answer. This is true, it is incredibly unlikely. Firstly one has to be clever to win a Nobel prize. Secondly, Robert W. Holley, Har Gobind Khorana and Marshall W. Nirenberg have already won the Nobel prize ( in 1968 ) for working out how the cells of humans ( and all other organisms ) " read " the " biotic code ". There is no such scientific law : you are making it up. No it doesn't. A scientific theory never becomes a scientific law. Scientific laws grow up into scientific theories. Scientific theories are as good as it gets. That is correct. The theory of gravity is a weak one : it has little going for it beyond a few laws and formulas. Actually that is gibberish. Humans are capable of of creating " the biotic code ". It may have taken us " milenia " to discover it, but once we did, it has only taken us a few decades to start using evolutionary principles to design our own new codes. There is no such scientific law. You are making it up.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>If you want to discuss this fine.

Since we still havent identified the purpose of all the code in the first place. If it fits the description it is. There are no laws of nature-laws of science-facinating. So now laws do exist-make up your mind. I agree everything you said is gibberish. There are no laws-there are laws-that qulaifies as gibberish. Copying and creating are not the same thing. To say we can genetically engineer DNA and produce life is not just gibberish it is a lie. You said : " The theory of gravity is a weak one : it has little going for it beyond a few laws and formulas " You seem a bit cofused. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You are the one confused! I very clearly stated that you were inventing " scientific laws " to bolster your otherwise unsupportable position, not that scientific laws do not exist. Now boyo, pull your finger out, edit your mess of a reply to get the quotes right, and I'll happily shred the rest of the nonsense you posted. I doubt you will bother though as usual.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Scientific laws are not something that can be invented, at least not by humans. They exist regardless if you are aware of them or not. Already did. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>There are no green apples as that would violate the scientific law that apples can only be red. I just made up a fake scientific law too. You are not the only one that can invent them. Now what where you trying to say again?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>There is no such thing as a fake law. The law exists or it does not. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>And if it doesn't exist, and you claim it does, then it's a fake law. Looks like you are wrong again peddler. What a surprise<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Please grow up. Your wrong nanana is not an arguement. If you cannot come up with an example of a contradiction then it is a law. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>We have come up with contradictions to every one of your made up laws. That is why they are not laws. Sadly you are such a hypocrite, you moan at me going " nanana " ( which I'm not ) whilst you have been doing it yourself for this entire thread.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It codes for proteins. I wouldn't say it has a purpose, no. What observational evidence? I observe no mind creating DNA. Information requires a mind as sender. Since a mind did not create the biotic code, it is not information.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So coding for proteins is not a purpose? It is difficult to argue with your logic. Did you observe my mind deciding how to answer that absurd comment? How many minds have you observed? Please give details as this is one of the more facinating claims I have ever heard. Or are you saying that minds do not exist because you have never observed one? Are you serious or are you just jerking my chain? That is a non-sequitur. It is absurd. On what evidence do you base that? Did the code write itself for as you say, no purpose? Are you seriously trying to tell me you think this way? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I wouldn't say it's a purpose, no. Is the purpose of rain to fall from the sky? It just does it, it isn't directed by anyone towards a goal. So no, I wouldn't call it a purpose. I see no evidence that DNA was created by a mind, therefore I see no reason to believe DNA is information. You are beginning your argument with the assumption that DNA is or contains information. There's no reason we should believe it does though.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>What you call it does not change what it is. As Shakespere said about the rose. I have no reason to believe you can reason. How did matter create itself? You are beginning your argument with the belief that there is no being more intelligent than yourself. No matter what the evidence says you will believe anything no matter how ludicrous than to consider you are not the highest form of life in the universe. That is an incredible assumption but you are so blinded by your religious beliefs you don't even know it. To believe you are the highest form of life is a very foolish thought. It begs the question. How would you know? If you cannot grasp that information cannot create itself then you believe these words may have appeared by magic. If you believe these words could not have possibly appeared without the input of an intelligent being but a code a billion times more condensed than the highest technology of man created itself you are delusional. I don't what else to tell you. This subject is beyond your ability to grasp. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Same goes for you, chump. There may well be more intelligent life in the universe. You certainly haven't provided any evidence of it, quite the opposite. Information cannot create itself. That is how we know DNA is not information. It's called evolution. You once pretended you had studied it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Then what it is it? If it has no purpose can you live without it? Pre-biotic natural selection is a contradiction in terms. Spontaneous generation was dispoved by Pasteur 135 years ago. http://www.arn.org/docs/meyer/sm_message.htm <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I don't know what you would call it. You use a variety of English I am not familiar with. Perhaps DNA contains just " codes ", " facts " or " blueprints "? Since you insist on defining words in extremely odd ways, I have no idea what you'd term an undesigned, complex, self-replicating system. Read your own links. Even the creationist websites you cite don't support your exceptionally ignorant claims. At least it is clear now where you have stolen your ideas about information. You have taken a rather shady piece of creationist work, digested it poorly, and spewed it out on this forum. Living things do not neccessarily contain DNA.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Fantasy, fairy tale, wild imagination, adsurd, silly, ridiculous, fabricated. Unsupported by one single observation or experiment, unsubstantiated. I do agree we don't speak the same language. No one will explain to me how one steals public information, I am confused. How is work shady? How would you define shady as opposed to rather shady when it refers to work? I thought bookmaking etc. was shady but I am old fashioned I guess. Please educate me. Is this a meaningfull reprimand coming from someone who believes one can observe a mind? You still have refused to explain that and I was so anxious to hear it. Please go on.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Information is a non material entity. Letters on a page at random are not information, information has to have meaning, a purpose.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why? Do you read Chinese? How about ancient Mayan? Since it has no meaning to you, is it not information? Your ability to understand the information does not affect whether or not it's information. It's also counter to your non-material entitity stance. How can something non-material have a meaning or a purpose? Waxy <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That's a deep thought. If I make up my own language and never tell anyone what it means would it inform anyone of anything? Is that not what information does, inform, instruct? An unknown language example would be cuniaform. Before the Rosetta Stone was found it was just meaningless symbols. Now that it has been translated it is information.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This is unbelieveable. :p It wasn't just meaningless symbols, it was a wealth of data, INFORMATION, the fact we didn't understand it yet does not mean it didn't exist, it was right there in front of us!

Information does not have to inform or instruct in order to exist. I'm absolutely mind boggled by your continued inablility or refusal to grasp this VERY simple concept. Waxy<br><b> S2:1-  </b>From dictionary.com 1 Knowledge derived from study, experience, or instruction. 2 Knowledge of specific events or situations that has been gathered or received by communication ; intelligence or news. See Synonyms at knowledge. 3 A collection of facts or data : statistical information. 4 The act of informing or the condition of being informed ; communication of knowledge : Safety instructions are provided for the information of our passengers. Only defnition 3 agrees with you. 1, 2, and 4 agree with Peddler. The concept is, perhaps, not as simple as you thought. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That's the entire point! He REFUSES to acknowledge #3. That's all I ask. Waxy<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You haven't exactly been acknowledging 1, 2, and 4 yourself. Information has multiple defintions. Everyone has grabbed the one they like and refuses to budge. That's not going to get us anywhere. Since this is all about Peddlers information theory argument why don't we let him present his definition, present his argument, and then go from there? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Have you seen me deny them? I haven't to my knowledge, I understand that part of the accepted definition of information involves the communication and understanding of data, even though I don't necessarily agree in all situations. No one has prevented him from putting forth his theory. Waxy<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well, yes, a couple of times. In post 41 you say and in post 65 you say You didn't give the impression that you were saying that this was only true in some situations, or for some definitions. You were being quite absolute. Since it seemed that you were denying defintions 1, 2. and 4, is it any wonder that Peddler isn't giving ground on acknowledging number 3? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Kronus, it's quite clear to me that neither of those quotes you supplied deny definitions 1, 2 and 4. They simply support definition #3 as being an absolute, which it is. If something exists that satisfies definition #3, that at the same time does not satisfy definitions #1, 2, and 4, it is still information, by peddler's own definition. He refuses to acknowledge that, as it would destroy his argument. Perhaps you could explain your stance a little further, as quite frankly, I'm not sure you have a point here or that you're adding anything constructive. Waxy<br><b> S2:4-  </b>My point was simply that arguing endlessly about defintions is pointless. If you don't actually use your defintion to make a point about something than one definition is as good as another. It had been about 75 posts since anyone had said anything except " your definition is stupid ", and I was trying to move things along.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>This is an idea I read somewhere and thought it was worth noting. Just because God knows exactly what we will do, does that make us any less free or does it mean we are forced against our will? It may be taken that God foreknows what our free acts are ; having knowledge of an act does not mean the act was forced or that the act was not freely done. For example, I can think of the past and know exactly what a person chose to do, and I can know with certainty that that is what the person did. But having knowledge of the act did not make the act any less free, and it doesn't mean that my knowledge of it directly caused or compulsed the person to choose it. Maybe God's knowledge of the future can be similar to our knowledge of the past ; knowing with certainty about a choice or action, without having forced it to happen.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That implies choice which if there is no free will there is no choice If the act is known and not a guess then again there is no choice it just is. That isn't foreknowledge and wouldn't make a difference on whether your future acts are already set. God doesn't need to be the cause, in theory God is not restricted to linear time as we are. God would then be capable of popping into any point in linear time and know the cause and effect of any action without influencing it. The issue with free will and God within religion is that God influences man's choices and by doing so robs us of our free will. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>A lot of it hinges around how you define free will, and it is this precise area where the controversy arises and is the reason why it has been debated for so long. Here you say we have free choice or free will but it is limited. From a theistic perspective, people could view it similarily as you have ; that free will or free choice is limited by God's " popping into any point in linear time " as you say. Personally, I am not fully convinced of one particular view of determinism or how to define freewill ( though I find myself leaning towards one view or another at different times ), but it can be fun to talk about.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The future would have to be set for him to pop into. Religion attempts to constrain free will to a choice between good and evil. That some men choose evil supports their idea of free will. The problem is the final choice is not proof of free will. What makes free will free is that it is made without influence. By offering eternal paradise in Heaven or eternal torments in hell God is influencing what man will choose. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If that is your definition of freewill, and that is what we are going by, then I agree with you. If you or your will needs to be free from all influence in order for it to be a free will, then it is quite obvious that we don't have that free will.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Its not my definition in that I pulled it out of thin air or picked what I liked. Its the drfinition one finds in an English Dictionary. I think it fair to consider that a reasonable place to start with respect to meaning. If you have different understanding then please let me know what it is and why it should be considered over the dictionary entry. The word free is kind of hard to get around. There is not a lot of wiggle room there. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The question is : In what regards is our will free? Free from what? You answered it one way by saying it is free from all influences ( which is just about everything ). Here is a link that goes through different other answers Free will - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This link does not have an exhaustive list of the different views, but it is enough to make my head spin. Here's another link with another view and definition. It's quite interesting, I haven't read all of it but it so far sounds like a viable possibility. http://www.optimal.org/peter/freewill.htm<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Databed, if any future decision can be foreknown, then free will cannot exist. Free will means that at the instant of the decision, any of all options can be taken. If the decision is foreknown, then none of the options can be taken except the one that is foreknown to be taken. It doesn't matter if god is directing or not, if he knows the option that will be chosen before it is chosen, then there is no choice among the remaining options, and therefore there is no free will.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I have to disagree. My example of a movie was supposed to emphasize that an observer can know the end while watching the middle but have no control over what is going on. This is because he does not exist in the same continuum as the movie itself. Would it satisfy some of you if I said that in this example, any attempt to step into the movie, or continuum, would result in changing the outcome of said continuum and remove any knowledge that an observer has of the future? Because this must also be true in my example. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Nobody is saying god is the director or controller, we are all agreeing for the sake of the discussion that he's just the observer. Even in this case free will is taken away from the ones being observed. If at some point in the movie the actor must make a decision, that decision is not one of free choice, but only the option that keeps the movie on the predetermined path. If you can fast forward or rewind the movie at any given point, and the actions at that point are already foreknown, then it is a predetermined action, not one of spontaneous free will at that point in the timeline.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But why not? Let's say that I do have freewill. I live my life making free choices free from influence of an observer outside of my continuum. You're basically saying that just because someone has the ability to move in time to any point within my timeline and simply view it, even if they have absolutely no ability to interfere, that my life was predetermined and the entity that determined the unfolding of my timeline cannot be me. Clear a couple of things up for me. In this scenario, if I wasn't determining my own path, then what was? Why can't something else, outside of my continuum, know what my actions are? I think you are not understanding what atemporality is in this case. If something knows what all of my actions are, you can't say that he knows them before they take place because there is no before, no after, no during in his continuum. He is outside of my timeline. He is atemporal to my continuum. My example of a movie was to demonstrate this. Just because someone can watch the movie having already seen it and knows what the ending is going to be, does not necessitate that the movie was predetermined within the timeline and at the time in which it was created. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Look at it from the perspective of options. For free will to exist, the chooser must have the liberty to choose any of the known options available. If your decisions are known, then the option you will choose is predetermined. Let's say you have to choose between options a, b and c. It is foreknown that you will choose option a. In such a case it is impossible for the chooser to pick option b or c. Those options, even though known by the chooser, are not possible to be chosen at all. It is equivalent to having no choice but to pick the option that was predetermined and foreknown. There was really no other choice at all to begin with<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I understand what you are saying, but you are again not grasping what I am saying as evident by the word " foreknown " as used above. The decisions are not foreknown, they are not known after they happen, they are not known at the time. They are simply known by an atemporal being. There should be no argument here, this is the way things must follow under the scenario I have presented. It is a way for omniscience to exist and free will to exist side by side ( note I avoided the word simultaneously and omnipotent ). Please note I am not condoning this view. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I define omniscience differently. Omniscience is the knowledge of all things that are. Things that are not simply are not. If you know all things that are, and do not know things which are not, you have omniscience. A future decision, action or event is something that is not, and therefore knowledge of something that is not is not a requirement for one to have omniscience<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Those ' easy ' translation do not state that gods ability is limited because he is incapable of anything. They are a reassurance of a promise. Please dont keep banging on with the same flawed argument if you dont want to hear the same explanation. Your explanation is only correct in YOUR own mind. All powerful and etenal are words only.. you cannot understand or comprehend their meaning. Your problem is that you cannot comprehend this. God cannot cease to exist in the same way that infinite cannot cease to exist.. if you think that this is a limitation on infinite then you do not understand or comprehend infinite. Which is exactly what I am saying. Thank you for proving my point for me<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Okay. Like I said, You're right, but only in your own mind. You asked me to show you where the Bible limited God, and I showed you that it clearly stated that God can't lie, can't look upon evil ( you still haven't responded to that one ), can't change, and can't cease to exist. Telling someone they can't understand something isn't at all convincing. I'm sure you can't understand it, but that's no reason to assert things about me, and even more so it's not an argument that helps you. All you are doing is saying " If you disagree, you just don't understand. " You've provided nothing to back up your position, and have resorted to ignoring and twisting any scriptures that prove you wrong so that you don't have to man up to your being wrong. And yes, ' infinity ' is limited in the sense that it can not end. It is a stipulation, and it exists for everything, which can easily be stated as this : It can't be something that it is not. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You are supplying the scriptures that do not back up your assertions... dont blame me for that. As I stated something that is infinite cannot be seen as ' limited ' because it cannot cease to exist ( and that in itself is making an assumption that cannot be backed up in any practical way ) It is your logic and the limitations of language that is limiting your ability to understand what is obvious. If you think that a covenant not to lie means the being that makes it is limited then I cant help you. If I promise not to lie to a child does that make me any less powerful? As for god cant look upon evil... this illustrates the limitation of language... does an omnipotent being have eyes? Could lucifer give him a poke in his eye and blind him or does he have an infinite amount of eyeballs? You provide the very questions in a form that proves my point To be honest your obtuseness is quite annoying, especially as you are projecting it at<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Can't back up that an eternal being can't cease to exist? That's the definition of the word! If it was possible for him to cease to exist, he wouldn't be eternal. And since an inability to do something is a limitation, my point is proven. Again, it's not the oath, it's that the verse says that it was impossible for him to break that oath ( because he can't lie ). You can't escape the word ' impossible ' here. You are trying to say that God just chooses not to, but that doesn't agree with the scripture. If it is possible for God to lie, the bible is lying. Either way, you asked for biblical support, and your position goes against what the bible says. If you still want to continue to believe that ' impossible ' doesn't really mean ' impossible, ' then go ahead, but your not convincing anyone else. The seeing evil argument really wasn't about the literal-ness of his ' eyes, ' but regardless I will take that one back since the bible contradicts itself on this issue : Proverbs 15 :3 <br><b>S1:3-  </b>What you dont understand is that if an infinite being cannot cease to exist it does not mean this is a limitation of the beings capabilities. It means that non existence is not applicable to it. When you understand that then you may start to understand your limitation in comprehension. Can god change his socks? Once again you are using an imperfect medium to try to make an point that is not appllicable. It is impossible for god to lie because he agreed not to, not because he cannot. This does not mean the bible is lying.. it means he means to keep his word. Sheesh.. once again you highlight the limitation of words.. the bible mentions gods eyes to try to make a point to people that have limited comprehension. None of the texts were meant to exactly quantify any aspect of god... but you supplied the sentences and complain when I take them literally in one way when you choose to take them literally in another Impossible means impossible because god chooses to do it. If want to believe that impossible means an omnipotent being cannot do something... hence not being omnipotent because he has agreed to do it the go ahead.. but you are not convincing anyone except yourself. Maybe you really think the bible told us god has eyeballs lol<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Shifting the goalposts. It is still a limitation on God. And if God created everything and sent himself to earth in human form, then yeah, he can change his socks, his shoes, his pants, and his underwear. ( He doesn't wear a shirt because as we all know, gods are ripped and like to show off their pecs ). Seems you still want to believe ' impossible ' means ' possible '. I think you need to check your own ' understanding ' of language. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>To be infinite is NOT a limitation because ' not existing ' does not apply to it and therefore cannot be seen as a limitation. If you think it does then I think you need to check your own understanding of language. A promise from a diety is as near as a certainty as to be written as impossible to be broken in a text written by man. If you think that it does not then you demonstrate again your limitations in understanding the limitations of the written word and so must believe god has eyes :). Why should god have to become a man to change his socks.. maybe he has celestial socks... will he still need to change them?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Okay, let me get this straight. If I think _______, then I must be an idiot. That sounds about right for a gansao argument, and because of that ( and the fact that you admitted you weren't taking the word ' impossible ' as completely impossible, which is what the word means ), I'm done here. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>OK Ill except the literal term impossible if you admit you think god has In other words.. yes you are an idiot for trying to make me accept a literal meaning of a word that suits you and implies an omnipotent being has limited abilities... as well as eyes.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>After reading this thread, I have one comment. I fail to see a hard connection between thermodynamics and evolution. TD has to do with the movement ( dynamics ) of heat ( thermal ) energy. Evolution has to do with cell reproduction which may or may not involve heat energy.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You're not seeing it because there isn't one. The argument that the creationsts make is that the 2nd law says that disorder must increase, evolution says that life becomes more complex, therefore evolution violates the second law. If you hang out on many EvC boards you see this come up all the time, and every time people carefully explain how the creationists are confused about what the second law means, and then it pops up again a little later. It's either frustrating or funny, depending on your outlook. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>... but the 2nd law does not say that disorder must increase. It has nothing to do with disorder. It basically says that heat energy flows along the gradient from warm things to cooler things and will not flow in reverse on its own. Just as we should not apply Kirchoff's 1st Law to compressable gases, we should not apply the laws of thermodynamics to biological evolution.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It does actually address disorder, see post 16 above. The real reason it's irrelevant is that it only applies to closed systems. If you pour huge amounts of energy into a system, for example sunshine onto the earth, then the second law can't be used. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I see your post, but I'm not convinced. That's like my saying marriage can be thought of in terms of order and disorder. Heat transfer has nothing to do with disorder. It has only to do will the movement of heat from one body to another.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The second law isn't about heat transfer per se, that's where you're confused. It deals with entropy. One aspect of entropy is order and disorder. Another is heat transfer. Here's a definition : elements in a closed system tend to seek their most probable distribution ; in a closed system entropy always increases. So if you're dealing with heat, it says that heat won't go from cold to hot by itself. If you're thinking about order and probability, it says that the air molecules in the room you're in will stay randomly distributed, and not all form a sphere in the corner. In the end it's all about the entropy. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>... but the distribution of air molecules in a room has more to do with Brownian motion than with heat transfer.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Can you expand on that? I'm not getting your point. Edit : Not sure if this address what you were saying, but it's relevant so I'll throw it in. The distribution of air molecules has nothing to do with heat transfer. It does, however, have alot to do with entropy. Entropy influences heat flow. Entropy also influences air distribution. These influences are described by the second law.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Isnt heat a frequency of radiation? Wouldnt the amplitude of heat in a mollecule be mediated by the ammount of gluons, weak guage bosons and photons it contained? I do understand that heat is supposed to be the kinetic energy of the individual mollecules due to there increase in velocity, and conserved in the mollecular body due to the collision of the mollecules up to the point of vaporization. But before that, some energy is lost due to radiation of these particles I mentioned earlier. But when a body of matter absorbs these particles and they become bound to the mollecules, does the velocity of the mollecule change? Or is the kinetic energy changed due to the increase in mass of the mollecule from the extra radiation particles?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Certain wavelengths of light, usually in the infrared and into the microwave can excite molecules into higher vibrational, roatational, or translational energy states. So frequencies of radiation can cause things to heat up, surely. Simple answer : NO. Gluons don't have much to do with heat as we experience it. Well, don't forget about vibrations and rotations, but heat is a manifestation of this kinetic energy, yes. Don't know what you are talking about with the " point of vaporization. " No, simple molecular collisions do not result in radiation of subatomic particles. Well, except when the collisions are really intense, as in an atomic bomb. Nope, this is nonsense. Sorry. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Gluons dont have much to do with heat? How bout the w and z bosons, and the photon? when a substance vaporizes, the individual mollecules draw heat away to cool the substance. This happens when the body of matter cannot radiate as much energy as it recieves, and the matter reaches an energy level sufficent to break the electromagnetic bond of the particles. In water, this would be the hydrogen bond. And mollecular collisions isnt what I'm talking about for radiation of subatomic particles. The mollecules may exchange these particles until the particles reach the surface of the body at wich time the wave / particle such as a photon leaves the body of matter leaving it with a lower kinetic energy. Please tell me why my last statement is nonsense?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well, the W znd Z bosons cause radioactive decay, so sure, they can contribute to heat. The photon, of course, is responsible for all kinds of things. It's those microwave photons that are heating your bag of popcorn. But gluons, IIRC, are the exchange particles responsible for the strong force. They just hold nuclei together. I don't see them contributing to heat in everyday circumstances. Ok, what does that have to do with what you were talking about? I think you were talking about atoms absorbing gluons or something, and that's just not how gluons work. I may be wrong, but gluons are not exchanged between nuclei, except in nuclear reactions, I suppose. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>This has to do with the exchange of the thermal energy of matter, or heat as it is defined. And gluons werent the only bosons I was talking about. I was just trying to point out that if a mollecule / atom gained a bosonic particle, then the kinetic energy of the mollecule / atom would increase due to the increase in mass. An example would be if a photon excites an electron, it stays with the electron in the excited state and therefore increases the electrons kinetic energy. When the electron discharges a photon, the electron drops to a lower quantum state, hence a lower kinetic energy. This increase / decrease in kinetic energy of the electron in an atom would increase / decrease the kinetic energy of the mollecule / atom.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I see. Photons do all this, but I don't know what gluons have to do with thermal energy, except that when the strong force is overcome, you have nuclear fission. That surely generates heat. Again, we have confused usage of the terms " temperature " and " energy. " The substance can be of one temperature, but the particles that make up that substance cannot all be in the same energy state. In a bose / einstein condensate they are in the same energy state. But normal matter, since it consists of fermions, cannot do this. http://www.pa.msu.edu/courses/1997sp...ic/bosons.html But here we are talking about apples and oranges. In one we are talking about thermodynamic microstates ( from statistical thermodynamics ) and calling them " energy states " and the other is talking about quantum mechanical states. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Temprature Is energy. Its just a specific form of energy. Thermal energy to be exact. And werent you just talking about thermal energy? And as for gluons, I dont know too much about them except that they mediate the strong nuclear force, and are responsible for holding nucleons together, as well as binding quarks together to form the nucleons. Do gluons have an energy value? I know that they are a point particle and have no volume, but they must have mass to have energy. And about your point of a substance being at a certain temp but the particles not being in the same energy state, does this have something to do with the fact that a crystal emits a certain frequency when it is heated or compressed? Mayabe the oscillation of the mollecules allign and this causes the frequency that we can detect. In a Bose / Einstein condensate are all of the particles bosons?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No, it is a measure of the average kinetic energy within a given frame. Sure, heat is just another way to say thermal energy. Sure. Ok. Of course. Well, in QED ( quantum electrodynamics ), mathematically particles are treated as dimensionless points, but they may not actually physically be that. But you don't have to have mass to have energy. The photon is the prime example of this. A photon has no mass, but can have a wide range of energies, from picometer-long gamma rays to kilometer-long radio waves. Not sure what you are talking about? The piezoelectric effect? Um, yeah. This page is cool : http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/bec/index.html Keep clicking Next. And Helium atoms are bosons. I'm not sure if the way they become a superfluid at a certain temperature has anything to do with Bose-Einstein. http://www.fluidmech.net/msc/super/super-f.htm Well, apparently they are : http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Superfluid That's interesting, I didn't know you could have Cooper pairs of atoms. { shrug } That's why I come on these boards.... <br><b>S1:5-  </b>How bout we all combine two different peoples theories into one! You XXXXX!<br><b> S2:5-  </b>What are you talking about now? Look, I was never even arguing with you about anything. But you made me curious about these " two theories " that I've somehow moronically combined into one? Do please explain. Perhaps you will find the answers in genesis.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I reckon that evolution is still just a theory for a valid reason. It is untrue and cannot be proven. Darwin himself said that his theory would be proven or disproven based on the future discovery of transitional fossils. There have been NO such fossils ever found. That being the case, even Darwin agrees that the theory of evolution is just man's folly. Ya'll can write millions of words about evolution, but what you lack is the proof of one discovery of transitional fossils The fact of the matter is that God created man in his own image. Case closed.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Explain the geological record of horses then, which shows the transitional changes. Not to mention a whole list of others. http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-transitional.html <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Soooooo, the horse is the missing link that explains away the fact of creation of man by God? I think not! Evolution, ride a monkey into Hell.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Talk about a cop out. You claim that no tranisition fossils exist. I proved you wrong. You now resort to the fallacy of raising the bar. How is that one who says he is dedicated to the truth can resort to such dishonest fraud? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>How can you prove that various fossils are transitional as opposed to being seperate and distinct species? Answer : You cannot. Are you referring to macro or micro evolution? It does make a difference. Could it be that evolution is true when referring to lower forms of life, but totally false when talking about man?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You didn't even open the link did you? Act of Fraud : fallacy : argument via laziness. That makes two acts of fraud upon your part. The link clearly gives examples of transitional fossils. Merely because you do not wish to learn ( or bother to simply click on a link provided to you ) does not make it wrong nor your claims correct. I suppose these two acts of fraud removes any credibility of you saying you seek and speak the truth. Why would there be any difference? I'm with thebootfitter, it seems likely that you will ignore any evidence of transitional fossils regardless of what anyone says. IMO, Guywithnobrain has got you pinned. you attack evolution because you claim it cannot be proven, yet you accept that God didit without any proof as the truth. How is that not hypocritical?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Abel was a shepherd, concerned for each individual in his flock, always moving, looking for fresh pasture, with time for poetry. [ Liberal ] Cain was a farmer, mechanizing his income, reducing his produce to numbers and weighed quantities, stuck in one place. [ Conservative ] The dreamer vs. the machinist. Which is better for the human soul?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Liberals vs. Conservatives The heart of the wise inclines to the right, but the heart of the fool to the left. - Ecclesiastes 10 : 2 <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Ecclesiastes 10 : 2 is actually " The heart of the wise inclines to his right, and the heart of the fool to his left. We all have to find our own place, and not succumb to dogma from one extreme or the other. The process begins within each person. " The Right " in Ecclesiastes has nothing to do with the pompous social Darwinism tarted up in snake handler robes and squealing absolutes about " Leftist " or " Communiss " that passes for " The Right " in 21st century politics.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Depends on which translation is being used. I like the one I quoted better. Does that mean when you find the truth you don't seriously buy into it? p.s. Obama sucks. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I'm not using a translation, I'm reading it in Hebrew. " S'molo " and " yemino " mean his right, his left. Your tourist guide is wrong, no matter what you " like better. " NO, it means that all experience is relative. It drives you absolutist snake handlers insane, but it's true that reality is nuanced. Imagining that there is a final answer, and that you know it, is pagan idolatry. People who supported Bush aren't smart enough to play with pointed scissors or operate a toaster, let alone weigh in on " who sucks. "<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Sorry, sport, but the translation I used came from Hebrew scholars also. Are you RELATIVELY sure of that or ABSOLUTELY sure of that?? ROTFLOL! Shows how stupid you are for making that claim. Bush was smart enough to outwit Gore and Kerry to win the presidency, so that doesn't say much for your butt-head heroes. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well, their supposed " scholarship " is as full of rubbish as you are. The " O " ending on Hebrew words indicates a male possessive. Your wishful thinking can't change grammar. Oh, but that's right, you Repuglican dittobaggers can just decide what's " true " according to your whim.

Each of us is the result of a thought of God. Each of us is willed, each of us is loved, each of us is necessary.    -- Benedict XVI I have to admit that I really don't know the incidence of believers of evolution amongst catholics, but catholics are not required to believe in evolution, and many disagree with the pope    s position that a belief in evolution is even acceptable. If the bible is the infallible word of god and it says right out of the gate :    And God made man in his image, in the image of God he made him : male and female   , then that    s pretty tough to get around, no matter what the pope says. Yikes, tebor. I didn't see that you had already posted that quote.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That just goes to show how ignorent even Catholics are. Let us look the puns from the original hebrew. When it talks about how god made man, it used the term ' formed '.. the same word that would used as a potter would form a pot. THe word " Adam " means man kind. It is similar to ' Adamah " which means red clay, and a related word is ' edom ', which means flesh and blood. So, if you look at the original hebrew, it basically says ' God formed mankind out of flesh and blood, as a potter forms a clay vessel '. Although evolution does not consider any supernatural influences, the ' forming of mankind out out oif flesh and blood ' is certainly consistant with evolution. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No, it is not. Single celled organisms do not have flesh or blood.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But apes do. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And you believe that god created apes?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Myself, no. I don't believe there is any deity what so ever. I, however, was commenting on the meaninging of Genesis if you read it in Hebrew, vs the rather inaccurate translation into English. It is obvious Genesis was only an allegory, not literal. Since it is only an allegory, it was commenting on spiritual truths, not historical or scientific facts. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>What you said was : The premise that god made apes ( or some other multi-celled organism ) is no more consistent with evolution than if he had just made man.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>That is your religious belief. However, many good christians disagree with you. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I don    t care how many good christians disagree with me. If you don    t believe in any deity, then using the support of people that you think are deluded to support your position is meaningless. Doesn    t evolution maintain that multi-celled organisms came from single-celled ones? If so, then any supposition that isn    t consistent with that transition is inconsistent with evolution.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Yes, and evolution has examples of intermediatary organism for that. Now, you claim that ' support using people that I think are delueded ' is meaningless. Where did I say they are deluded? You seem to be projecting. It seems you want to disregard anything that does not meet your opnion. How is that debate? You just have a knee jerk reaction, and ignore any kind of evidence that is presented that does not meet with your preconceptions. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Therefore you are conceding that    the ' forming of mankind out out oif flesh and blood ' is certainly consistant with evolution    is wrong. Just follow the train of logic. Intermediate between single-cell and multi-cell? What are your examples? You have already conceded the debate. Therefore, you yourself can    t think much of the    evidence   . I said that I don    t care how many good christians disagree with me. Why should I? ( You    ve given no reason whatsoever that I should. ) Vast numbers people have believed all kind of nonsense, including the earth is flat. They are not deluded? Then there is a god, and you are deluded. Okay, have it your way : You are deluded.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The will of the majority should be based on life experiences and worldviews, and little else. If their will was to be based on any type of education, the U.S. Constitution would have been written differently. The argument can't really be made that times have changed - that the founders came from a time when there wasn't much higher education. The founders could all read and write, yet a large percentage of the U.S. population could not at that time. Yet they made no distinction between the role of literates and illiterates in participating in government. It's very comparable with the college educated, and non college educated today.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Try to stay on topic Marc 9000. The discussion and my post had nothing to do about religion. We were talking about education and the founding fathers ' views on the lack of education. This is the 2nd time you've tried to change the topic after making unsubstantiated claims : <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I responded to your post. In debate, when a basic position is challanged, it is natural to go into more detail. The founding fathers ' views on the lack of education would correspond with their worldviews. My " unsubstantiated claims " were my opinion. Can you go into more detail of why you believe they were unsubstantiated, or is crying foul about " subject changes " all you have?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You asked for more constitutional examples, and I posted 2 of them : the 6 year terms of senators, and the electoral college. You responded by changing the subject to religion, and not responding to the view the founding fathers had regarding education. Changing the topic is not going into more detail. What has been said about Jefferson ( or any other person of that time ) that has been distorted, as you claim? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The constitution makes no reference to education, concerning terms of senators or represenatives, or any of the workings of government. The senate is a level above the house, hence the longer terms. Concerning your " shifting terms of the rabble " reference, the concern was about " mob rule " - a majority taking advantage of a minority. A thing called greed. Greed and education, are not related. Since you missed what I said concerning the view of the founding fathers regarding education, I'll repeat what I said ; The founding fathers views on education would correspond with their worldviews. Mainly this ever increasingly famous paragraph, in a courtesy note he wrote to the Danbury Baptists in 1802 ; This is brief, considering how thorough it is. It does not waste words. http://www.crosswalk.com/news/1218043.html In 1947, the ACLU was 27 healthy years old. It has taken full advantage of Hugo Black's judicial activism.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>And once again, it is quite clear from the writings of Hamilton, Adams, Madison, Jefferson, et. al., that the uneducated masses were to be feared, and this fear was expressed in two ways : protection of the government from the uneducated, and establishment of public education. The founding fathers ' views on the uneducated correspond exactly with their written views on the uneducated. Except that the term ' separation of church and state ' became part of the body of law long before 1947 : Chief Justice Morrison Waite, ( in Reynolds vs. U.S., 1878 ) cited Jefferson's letter of 1802 and the phrase ' separation between church and state ". He further stated in his written opinion " Coming as this does,... from an acknowledged leader of the advocates of the measure, it may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the amendment thus secured. " And it should be noted that it was only after the passage of the 14th amendment that the separation clause became a matter to be adjudicated. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Where are they? They're not in the Constitution, or Bill of Rights, or Declaration of Independence. Are they in the Federalist papers? SHOW ME. I think not.

It is not circular reasoning to say inatimate objects cannot create, recieve or transmit information it is a law of science. It is universally true that matter cannot create or transmit information. There are no exceptions. It has been observed and is always the case. Give me an example. Circular reasoning is deciding a theory and then trying to make it fit the evidence, When the evidence conflicts the theory instead of discarding the theory you modify it to fit the evidence. If we find soft tissue that is in 60 ma old rock instead of deciding the rock really is not 60 ma we are amazed at the miraculous disconvery that tissue can last 60 ma.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>since when is information and advice interchangable? the term " create information " is an oxymoron. information is discovered, processed or translated.

I agree that creating information is the work of science fiction writers. It is the work of all writers. Information must have a purpose it does not have to be true. The purpose of science fiction is entertainment. Are you really not intellectually capable of grasping this or are you just jerking my chain? If you don't grasp this fact I cannot help you. My ten year old niece does.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>this is probably why we disagree. you define information as anything that can be communicated, recieved or processed by a mind ( or computer, or any processing device ). i define information as facts neither of us are wrong, because both are valid definitions of information communicable information can be created. facts cannot back to the original assertion : considering information in dna that you insist must be inputted by an intelligent mind, would you consider that information being there as fact? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I disagree. You can create your own definition out of thin air but it is not valid.

Was that simple enough for you to get it? A definition almost always consist of several different ideas that are part of what defines a word. Taking one point out of context is just playing with semantics. For example : Insanity : Something that is extremely foolish. To say that is a complete accurate definition of insanity is a dishonest use of semantics. That definition could lead to this : " We put our children in an institution because they made a pile of leaves and then scattered them back out. This proved they were insane. " If you look at the whole definition one could not reach that conclusion. Persistent mental disorder or derangement. No longer in scientific use. Law. Unsoundness of mind sufficient in the judgment of a civil court to render a person unfit to maintain a contractual or other legal relationship or to warrant commitment to a mental health facility. In most criminal jurisdictions, a degree of mental malfunctioning sufficient to relieve the accused of legal responsibility for the act committed. Extreme foolishness ; folly. Something that is extremely foolish. Synonyms : insanity, lunacy, madness, mania, dementia Playing with semantics is not honest or beneficial to an intelligent discussion.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>simple enough, except that you didnt create that information. can you give me an example of 1 bit of factual information about america that you created? i used a dictionary definition, as did you. both " facts " and " something that can be communicated " are derivitives of the dictionary definition. " something that is extremely foolish " is not a derivative of the dictionary definition for " insane " anyway, please create one bit of factual information about america <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I did not create the facts I created the information.

Note that the handlers around here have repeated pointed out that the big bang has nothing to do with evolution. Note how the creationist's ears are armoured against such unwelcome news and how he happily continues to wallow in the mud of dillusion that lines this " lie " habitat that he has built for himself. You are a pathetic little liar, peddler 8111. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>How dare you call me little! I disagree with the handlers. In order to have a naturalistic explanation for the origin of life you must have a naturalistic explanation for the origin of the universe do you not? Naturalism is a worldview not just one specific subject. The god of time and chance-The Almighty IT - must exist for evolution to be true. Therefore evolutionary cosmology is a necessary part of the evolution theory.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Neither statement relates to evolution. Evolution is concerned with the change in form of organisms : not with how the universe came to be and not with how the first life came to be. A god could have created the first life fully formed. A god could have caused the " big bang ". Neither has any affect upon the theory of evolution. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Evolution is concerned with the change in form of organisms? That is a totally meaningless statement. Evolutionist decide what evolution means to fit their paticular argument at the time. Evolution is based on the god of time and chance. If the universe is only millions of years old it could not have happened. If you honestly look at the history of the age of the earth you will see it must be agreed on by committee-all these various branches of science could not have come to the same conclusion at the same time. Cosmology, geology, palentology must agree or it is a dead idea.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Incorrect. You may not understand it, but it isn't meaningless. Incorrect. Evolution could be a completely god-driven mechanism for all we know. The science of evolution can only view it from a naturalistic perspective though. It isn't, so your point is irrevelent. Incorrect. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Incorrect. Evolution could be a completely god-driven mechanism for all we know. The science of evolution can only view it from a naturalistic perspective though.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Surely you know, what with you claiming to be an expert. Do you really need me to define what the theory of evolution ( ie what is meant by " evolution " in this context ) covers though? It is : the change in allele frequency over time Happy now, or do you need me to translate this into simple terms for you? Incorrect. The theory of evolution is one of the best understood and most detailed of all sciences. It is at the core of all modern biology. True, only with social evolution, evolution of operating systems etc. The word " evolution " does have other uses. In the context of a discussion of the theory of evolution though it is concerned solely with biological evolution, ie the change in organisms over time ( or more precisely the change in allele frequency over time ) Showing macro evolution doing what? There are thousands of peer reviewed documents out there relating to evolution. Please be more specific so that I can narrow the list down a bit. Don't lie please.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>and right here is where faith is thrown out the window. faith means that you are right, regardless of evidence. faith means the absence of doubt. being open about the possibility that you might be wrong is exactly the same as nullifying your faith. the " wisdom " that these ancient men wrote in the bible were based on the poor knowledge of science and truth about the universe they had at the time. since they were wrong about so much, then we can safely assume that the bible is not God's word. therefore, any religious or theological advice it contains is nothing beyond uneducated guesses and obsolete information. the bible contains no truth that cannot be found in any other text books. and as a religious guide, it lacks any influence of God, so therefore is useless in that regard as well. it is of no value<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That's not faith you're describing, it's pigheadedness. It's sticking your fingers in your ears and going " la-la-la, I can't hear you! " Faith isn't belief despite evidence, it's belief despite lack of evidence. It's not the absence of doubt, it's perserverance in the face of doubt. Failure to admit that you could be wrong doesn't show your faith in God, in shows your faith in your own infalibility. It's procaiming that not only can you not be wrong, but that you understand God perfectly ; both ludicrous claims. If your faith is really strong, then it will stand up to self-examination. Everyone doubts, everyone questions. Sometimes the questions lead to new answers, sometimes they reinforce the old answers. But you have to ask the questions. An unexamined faith isn't faith, it's just pride and stuborness. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>if God tells you something, then it must be true, regardless of evidence. wouldnt the fact that God says something be enough to make it true? lets say, for example, God says that if you paint your door red someone will deposit $10000 in your bank account. now assuming that the actual one and only true and living all-mighty God said so, would that alone make it true? you may not even have a bank account, but once you paint your door red, you expect to be the owner of a bank account with a $10,000 balance in it, not so? if there is anything at all in the bible that was actually said by God, then it MUST be true, regardless of evidence for or against. doubting that it is true would not change the truth about it, but acting on anything actually said by God would make absolute sense, because that would be the absolute truth. if someone has no doubt in their mind that a statement made by God is totally and irrefutably true, is that person pigheaded and stubborn?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No. But that's not what we have here, is it? We don't have a statement made by God, we have a statement that you believe was made by God. In fact, you believe that every single statement in the Bible was made by God. And you refuse to examine that assuption, for fear of losing your faith. And so, in the name of your infallible faith, you've closed your mind to everything else. You've closed yourself off from all of creation because you refuse to even consider the possibility that every single word in the Bible didn't come straight from God. Remember, no one is questioning God's truth, they're questioning whether or not something is God's truth. Faith in God is great. Refusal to consider whether or not something did in fact come from God is pigheaded and stubborn. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>ok, so once again, how do we determine what in the bible was said by God, if any? in fact, it may be totally possible that NOTHING in the bible is actually the word of God. we already can safely say, according to you, that not everything in the bible purported as the word of God was actually said by God. so what in the bible is? and how do you determine that? if the bible is not the source for the word of God, what is?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>How do you find the word of God? Read the Bible critically, with an open mind. Read the works of wise and good people. Talk with people and discuss things ; again, with an open mind. Accept that you don't already have all the answers. Be willing to learn and grow. It won't be easy. It takes alot of work, and may cause you to change some long held opinions, which can be scary. But, if you'll forgive me for reading between the lines of some of your posts, I think you already know that some of your beliefs contradict the evidence of the real world. I think a part of you already is questioning whether a literal Bible really makes sense. So take the next step. Re-read the Bible, but this time without the assumption that it's all God's literal word. Ask yourself who wrote what you're reading, and why? What were they trying to say? What does it mean? How does it fit in with the rest of what you've read? Try that, and you may find things that you've never seen before. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>you are saying that by reading the bible only, i will not find all the answers. since the bible is but the work of man, and a collection of personal judgements and best guesses, what makes it more valueable than anything i can come up with? there is no reason to believe these men were hearing from or being inspired by God, since they got so many errors. there is no way to determine which of the authors either genuinely heard from God, or recorded correctly what they heard. there is no way to determine if the people that compiled the modern canon were inspired by God and not politics ( which is likely the case ) since God hadnt actually spoken to any of the authors of the bible back then, why would we assume that he is a God that communicates to humans?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Not all people are the same. Some are evil, some are good. Some are wise, some are foolish. The best guess of a good, wise man is worth more than that of an evil idiot any day, right? Is Pol Pot's take on morality worth as much as Ghandi's? Obviously, no. Likewise, the writers of the Bible display uncommon wisdom, which makes their words worth more than the average Joe you might pull off the street. That's why its valuable. There's wisdom in there that has survived the test of time for millenium. Don't discard it just because it didn't come directly from God. I won't lie to you. It is possible that after reading the Bible with an open mind you could reach that conclusion. On the other hand, after allowing for human fallibility, the word of God may come through more clearly than ever before. You seem to want to know where the journey will end before you start it. I can't tell you that, no one can. You just have to have faith that if you start with an open mind and good intentions, you'll end up in the right place.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I think perhaps that their scientifically proven instinct might have overruled their lack of lust. So your saying there was no water in the ark. LOL. Thirsty Noah. Poopa scoops at the ready. Perhaps that was why Noah was so keen for his raven to find some dry ground. Genesis 8 : 7, 8:11, and finally 8:12. Probably the same thing they fed the lions in London Zoo during the food rationing in WW 2    hay bails, and they stayed healthy. Think they prefer meat though, LOL<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Now, really, Richard. You don't have to argue against my questions as they were not meant as arguments - they were just things I wondered about when I was a little kid. I no longer need to wonder about these things, any more than I need to wonder how come Santa gives all the rich kids the cool toys. In a debate the onus of proof is on the person postulating a theory. So, if I were to propose that humans came from alien spaceships to colonize the earth, I would have to offer the evidence. I could not just say " well, prove that human / aliens didn't populate the earth from spaceships. " Nonetheless, people have offered plenty of sound evidence against the idea of a global flood of the nature described in the Bible myth. Aside from the overwhelming geological data which shows no evidence at all of a global flood, there are numerous logical problems with the Ark story. See the evidence here. Afterwards, feel free to read the rebuttal, then the rebuttal of the rebuttal. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I know mizmaxx, it seemed like an amusing time to join a debate. Your thoery on aliens wouldn't raise as many questions as evolution but it's still flawed. Who pesenting the theory anyway? the thread title asks a valid question about a sound piece of history. Richard.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I wasn't presenting an alien theory. I was saying that if I was, it would be up to me to provide the evidence to back it up. Saying " well, prove that aliens didn't populate the planet " is shifting the burden of evidence. Therefore, if you want to postulate a theory ( " The Noah's Ark story is true. " ), it is up to you to provide the evidence that proves your statement, not others to prove you wrong. If you don't have enough evidence to defend your theory such that you need to take an offensive ( as opposed to defensive ) position, you should re-think the value of your theory. At least, you should not expect others to believe it as you do, since it is based on a chosen faith and not logical evidence. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Correct! but the theory according to the thread title is not really a theory at all rather a question, which I have answered before, so me asking a question is not shifting the burden of evidence mearly inviting more debate. Not my argument!!! now who's shifting. Read my response to lurch.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Incorrect! When a person says you are shifting the burden, they are usually not referring to the title of the debate, but to what you have said. Therefore, it doesn't matter if the thread title is " How does Santa fit all those toys on the sled? ", and you had already replied " Obviously he shrinks them with magic until he is through your chimney. " If you go on to say, " well, where's your scientific evidence that rudolph didn't have a red nose? ", you would still be shifting the burden of evidence. Therefore, as you are the one putting forward a theory ( global flood ), it is up to you to defend that theory. So, what is your evidence of this global flood?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>These are philosophies of science, not actual science itself. People are subjective, even scientists. The latter use a tool of objectivity ( science ) to minimise that subjectivity ( such as recognising the bias of the hypothesis and thus testing the inverse [ the null hypothesis ] ), but they remain subjective. Science can be debased by bad scientists. G.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You say that they are not science, only because you know Nazi science to be ' false '. You were ( probably ) * taguht western capitalist science, only it doesn't have the term attached to it. Most people on this forum believe that it is the normative theory of science, and then all other versions of science are false. For instance ( and this is from my ' many faces of science ' ) Darwin believed women were meek, in line with the beliefs of his century. Male dominated science continued to describe the characteristics of women, in evolutionary terms, but through the male perspective. Now feminist scientists for instance ' discovered ' that the ovum actually snare a sperm, so it's not passive at all. Any previous description of the fertilisation of the egg was ' true ' through a western male dominated perspective. However there's an alternative western feminist theory. * Assuming you're educated in the UK <br><b>S1:2-  </b>montalban, if there is one thing that I detest in people, its them not listening to what I say and assuming I meant what they wanted me to say. If I believed that they were " not science, only because [ I ] know Nazi science to be ' false ' ", I would have said so. If I say that they are philosophies of science and not different types of science, its because THAT IS WHAT I MEAN! You are unable to differential between science and philosophies of science. You can repeat the idea that there are multiple types of science as much as you want, but you are wrong and will remain wrong. " Feminist Science " and " Maxist Science ", " Western Capitalist / English Impiralist Science " " Ignorance-based Misinformed Idiot Creationist Science " are not sciences. They are different ways of applying subjectivity to the objectivity of science. G.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If what you say is true, then I might term evolution as the philosophy of ' Western Capitalist / Imperialist Science " Would that make you happy? I suspect though that you believe that evolution is not a philosophy of science and is ' science ' Anyway, again you miss the point. You can only call Nazi science non-objective, because you believe it is false science. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The theory of evolution through natural selection is neither philosophy of science, nor ' science ' ; its science. You are doing it again. How do you know that I believe " Nazi science " to be false science? G.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes, it's comforting to believe that. But it is a materialist philosophy that has mutually exclusive evidences and other contradictions. However, Feminist philosophies of science :) have shown that evolutionary science is in fact dominated by a male-orientated philosophy of science. What you hold to be ' true ' in an evolutionary sense, is not necessarily true. Thus I showed that Darwin believed that women were the weaker of the two sexes, and evolutionary science for the next 100 + years has come to show this to be true - excepting under the gaze of feminists, who have shown a lot of these assumptions are in fact false. Where is the ' true ' science in all of this? You said it wasn't science, but a philosophy of science. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The science is not the people's opinions ( thats the philosophy ) but in the underlying maths and empirical evidence. You only seem interested in reading people's opinions of science, rather than learning about the science itself. I think you do this as finding people who disagree with each other encourages you to form the often false opinion that the science itself is divided. Exactly : I said it was a philosophy of science, not a false science. Rather than asking for clarification of my position though, you seem hell bent on making assumptions about everything I say that you do not understand. Unfortunately this does make you appear rather stupid, which I'm not sure you are. G.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Are you sure you want to hitch your wagon to a New Age Buddhist? So I resemble my father because we live in the same town or because I imagine I want to or should? I'm confused.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I did not come on here to talk about Dr. Lipton's spiritual beliefs. My OP is about how evolutionists have developed a whole theory based on the fraudulent premise that genes control everything. How many times have you head " it's in the genes "? But how can genes control anything if they don't even control the cell they reside in? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You don't believe in inherited traits?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>yes but that does not mean that genes are in control of these traits. Remember the " car key " analogy? Don't get confused with correlation and causation. Genes are just tools that the body uses. They are correlated with traits but they themselves are not the cause. And like I said, if genes aren't even in control of the cell in which they reside, how could they be in control of anything else in the body? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So what do you believe is the mechanism passing traits from one generation to the next?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It's called the miracle of life, brotha! Life is non-scientific and no mechanism can be ascribed to it. You may be able to watch new traits form or emerge in offspring, but how it happens will always remain a mystery... just like mystery of life itself. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I'm fairly certain that no miracle is involved with the fact that my eye color is exactly the same as my father's.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Maybe so... but let's change it up. How do you explain that butterflys emerge with different traits according to which season / which environment they are born in? what is that mechanism?... the people who did the study don't evidently know. http://www.arachnology.org/monteiro/...0400080400.htm<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Yes but it was all written by religious people.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>All the studies concluding AGGC were written by climatologist. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Are you sure you are not still religious because you sure do think like one. What is AGGC?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Typo, AGCC. Anthropogenic Global Climate Change. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And you know it's wrong because the weather seems fine to you?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I know nothing is wrong because I haven't heard any good reason why it wouldn't be. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>And what exactly qualifies you as a global warming expert?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>What qualifies you as a theologian? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I don't need to be a botanist to see that grass is green. If we let climate change deniers determine our course of action and they are wrong who will take responsibility?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I think you've made my point for me. If I let climate change believers determine my course of action and they are wrong who will take responsibility? I am taking responsibility now by demanding both evidence and logic ( collectively known as support ). I don't need to be a theologian to see that religion has no support, I don't need to be a climatologist to see that AGCC has no support, and I don't need to be a botanist see that grass is green. If people like you and easyrider feel you can correct me, you are going to need to do it with support. Asserting that if I pursued the same titles as those whose authority you invest your full faith in, I would then no longer need convincing is insufficient.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Ez doesn    t have a mother, he's an orphan.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Not sure you're right there, but I am sure that he doesn't have anyone who would admit to being his mother. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Actuality he is a test tube baby, created by science.

And the degree to which you are wrong is astounding. As to thinking people rejecting the core of NDS, lets just say that given the number of nobel prize winners in genetics and associated sciences ( Including please note both Haldane AND Fisher ) IMHO there is a rather large body of scientific opinion of the higherst repute which contradicts your statement. Now I realize that you can and do outhink any individual nobel prize winner - thats obvious from the tenor and high quality of your reasoning, but I not willing to concede that you have outthought the whole packj of em, not to mention the entire Darwin, Wallace, Huxley etc etc etc crowd!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>l ** Your logical fallacy here is the infamous, ' argument from authority '. The fact that a lot of people with college degrees happen to disagree with me simply does not make their opinions correct, and my opinion wrong. You don't like that fact, but it is a logical principle, a matter of fact, nonethelees. Truth is not about popularity and celebrities. It's about evidence, and your crew has none. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Nope its about verifiable facts and supportable intrepretations. The individuals I referenced were all masterful at both the facts and the intrepretation and thier work has survived scrutiny and testing by many scientists. Your concepts simply do not have that patina - and I might add that arguing " I AM THE AUTHORITY " is weaker than the argument to well known and established authorities! So far as I can see the only support for your theory is your claim to BE an authority and to be right. Absent good and sufficient support this is not at all convincing.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>** Sez u. Duh. Bet you can't specify any of these imagined " verifiable facts ", nor any of the hard evidence supposedly supporting these " supportable interpretations ", can you? ** Yeah, I'm sure their followers admired them almost as much as their mothers did. ** I don't need a ' patina ', since I'm not arguing from my own authority, but from the authority of fact and reason. ** Which is precisely why I have never ever argued that " I AM THE AUTHORITY ". That's just another of your little hallucinations. What I have argued is that fact and logic have an authority that trumps your dogma's false authority every time. ** Anyone who has been following our dialogue will have noticed by now that you have trouble seeing anything that does not conform to your own pre-formed expectations. ** The facts and the reasoning are sufficient to any mind that is not prejudiced against them. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>" Actually not, your facts ( which you tend to distort ) are not in general supportive of your reasoning, at least not in the standard sense of driving one to the conclusions you reach. I could see you getting the import of the publshed material wrong once, but you have done it EVERY TIME so far. A mistake is one thing, a deliberate pattern of distortion made with the hope of getting away with it is quite another.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>** Sez u. ** Sez u. ** Ah, so then you are morally culpable for all your lies and distortions. I was hoping that stuff was rooted in either congenital stupidity or dogmatic ignorance, but apparently not. You've known what you were doing all along, but your conscience didn't stop you. For shame, sir!<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What about un-advancement, is it possible that something can evolve in to a less advanced form?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So since isolation allows divergence we're just cutting to the chase and defining species by isolation? That removes it even further from any underlying genetic pattern. It obviously happened but it did not evolve ( the process ). A tautology is not false because it is a tautology ; in fact that would be a contradiction. My argument is not a tautology, you simply cannot abandon the premises that it's falsification would require. Actually that can happen but it requires the exceedingly rare case that every step in the annihilation of a system is beneficial because it destroys the system. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>How about the blind river dolphin, do you think that is an example of something un-advancing? South Asian river dolphin - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia They use to have sight but evolved into blind animals, would that be an advancement or not?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Yes that is un-advancing ( the loss of a system ), and while this may help their species in the short term it reduces the ability to adapt to future changes. Now when I say yes I mean I think it's possible, it could also have been genetic drift allowed to destroy a currently vestigial eye. @ MrWriteLA the modification of the limb to be better at swimming is not the loss of a limb. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Dolphins used to live on land but returned to the sea via evolution, that would be something you don't agree with, right?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I cannot disagree with a fact. But were they a different species before contact? Are polar bears and brown bears the same species now that we have confirmed a hybrid? Every diploid organism is genetically diverse from each other. If you're saying divergence constitutes a new species how much? Arguments need premises, and I have them. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So you do agree that dolphins once lived on land but returned to the sea through evolution?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>They weren't dolphins when they were on land and no, not through evolution there are advancements over land mammals in dolphins. Obama, health care, life, Americans, accessibility are in the universe. Same problem. You couldn't display your ignorance more clearly. Neither of those were arguments. You aren't qualified to be debating much less lecture on logic. Well that's what happens when you make up terms bennedict You are now in direct contradiction with yourself : A = " A claim or argument made regarding the nature of anything in the universe is considered a scientific claim or argument. " A = " an argument dealing with something in the universe " A = ~ A <br><b>S1:5-  </b>What kind of advancements?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>You have contradicted yourself : You have identified statements erroneously as arguments : Since you do not admit or even seem to recognize these failures it is unlikely that it was a mistake and more likely that you are ignorant of the fact they are failures. Thus you lack the basic knowledge of formal logic required to understand or participate in debates effectively. The sonic systems for one. Their intelligence has no doubt taken a unique path since divergence and is superior to most land mammals. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>So you are saying the sonic system and the intelligence of dolphins can not be explained by evolution?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Correct, nor any other system. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>So breeding dogs using selection is plausible, but making big changes like from lower intelligence to higher intelligence or developing a XXXX-hole in the top of your head is not?<br><b> S2:7-  </b>The scale involved is unimportant except to the odds of spontaneous generation. Dog breeding may have produced a great deal of diversity but as of yet no one's tried to construct novel systems with it. That is conceivable for people to do because we can have a final system in mind and select for something that is not naturally beneficial merely because it moves towards the system we are trying to build. I know no example in any animal breeding of this occurring, even our genetic engineering usually just tampers with existing systems to suite our tastes or we just copy useful proteins from other organisms and paste them onto crops and such. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Evolution gives us very reasonable explanations to everything we see around us, just because we haven't seen all of it doesn't mean the rest of what we know is wrong.<br><b> S2:8-  </b>Support that. <br><b>S1:9-  </b>Supporting common sense seems redundant. So then you propose that everything we know is unsupportable like some story from Ren   Descartes?<br><b> S2:9-  </b>I refer you to post 151 I cannot argue against an appeal to common sense. <br><b>S1:10-  </b>Yes but you did not answer my question : Do you propose that everything we know is unsupportable like some story from Ren   Descartes?<br><b> S2:10-  </b>That question is a fallacy of complex question. You cannot know the unsupportable. <br><b>S1:11-  </b>No it's actually pretty simple, let me put it another way, do you think we can not believe in what we see?<br><b> S2:11-  </b>We can know we've seen it and draw conclusions from it, I am not sure what you're asking. Hardly, we simply cannot proceed on about the nature of arguments and truth when you don't understand what an argument is much less deal with your contradiction on scientific vs non-scientific. Read up, admit your mistake and we can continue.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>That opinion explains a lot. You're right that it's built in though, just like the ability to do math. Doesn't mean that there isn't an art to doing it correctly, one that allows you to recognize mistakes both to avoid them yourself and the reject them in the opposition. So why didn't bennedict know that the statements he posted weren't arguments? How could he miss the contradictions in his statements on the definition of a scientific argument?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>a ) My statements were argumentative, as seen by the context. Redundant premises were excluded. b ) You have yet to show a contradiction. YOU have made a contradiction. You : "...' regarding the nature of ', ' dealing with ', and ' pertaining to ' are all closely synonymous ( as attested to by dictionary.com )... " Me : " as you still owe me a link which defines '... the nature of...' as being synonymous with '... pertaining to... ' " You : " No I don't, I never claimed that. " Statement A = ' regarding the nature of ' and ' pertaining to ' are synonymous You : Statement A Me : Prove Statement A You : I did not make Statement A Remember when I told you how silly you sound sometimes? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>All the premises were redundant? :p Can you please provide a quote of the bolded?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No ; you've called the quote a statement, and you've said a statement within an argumentative context is a premise. Thus, I've given an argumentative premise. Upon being asked to provide the dictionary.com link which states " nature " as being synonymous to " pertaining ", you said this : " I never claimed that. " [ #185 ] I then put the record straight by saying " Just for reference - you are now stating that you've never claimed that "... the nature of... " and "... pertaining to... " are synonymous. " [ #186 ] You have replied with " Correct. " [ #187 ] <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I have not said the bolded explicitly, and an argument is still not a premise. Perhaps I wasn't clear, provide a quote of me denying statement A.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>What?? You didn't. You claimed not to have said statement A. If you had denied it, that would be okay, because indeed statement A is false. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I did say statement A, but I did not deny it. If you require a nitpick to keep you from losing correctness in the details I am happy to provide that service.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Nonononono. You said statement A, then you claimed not to have said it. Drop the whole denying thing, because it is redundant and a red herring. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>That I later ' concede ' in a PM? You mean despite the fact that probably coming up on a dozen times now I have told you premises represent evidence and you decided that the last time I told you this was a concession.... What do you think a ' logical premise ' is? Show me denying that I said A. I'll be honest I have no way to prove otherwise because proof relies on logic. Of course there is an objective truth here, I can illustrate the contradiction inherent in false logic using the real world ; but if you don't accept that contradiction is unacceptable....<br><b> S2:5-  </b>If a premise is true, it can be used as evidence. How does one determine a premise to be true? You said in the PM : " With evidence. It will take quite a lot of research to get to that premise. That premise is the conclusion of the research. " I call this research " scientific evidence ", as it exists in a scientific context. Upon being asked to provide the dictionary.com link which states " nature " as being synonymous to " pertaining ", you said this : " I never claimed that. " [ #185 ] I then put the record straight by saying " Just for reference - you are now stating that you've never claimed that "... the nature of... " and "... pertaining to... " are synonymous. " [ #186 ] You have replied with " Correct. " [ #187 ] <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Ah so scientific evidence is only recorded observations? I also stated the method by which research was connected to a higher premise, an argument concluding that higher premise. I did not show that nature is synonymous to pertaining, and I did not claim that they were. Interesting, but what of denying that I said statement A?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Yes, among other things. Premises are not useful unless proven true, yes? A true premise can be used as evidence towards an argument. A premise is understood to be true if evidence supports it, so in a formally laid out argument, a true premise is just a statement supported by evidence. http://numero6.altervista.org/_alter...urfacepalm.png "...' regarding the nature of ', ' dealing with ', and ' pertaining to ' are all closely synonymous ( as attested to by dictionary.com )... " [ #177 ] That is a denial of you saying statement A. What would you expect to see for this? <br><b>S1:7-  </b>' A true premise supported by evidence ' in the context of that support the true premise is the conclusion. You're talking about a lower level argument that's all. A statement is understood to be true if a sound or cogent argument supports it, or for all practical purposes both parties agree it's true. All statements can be used as premises. Only true premises will render the argument sound or cogent ( useful ). Not all statements are supported by an earlier argument, some are self-evident. Such as observations. I would expect to see me denying statement A.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>In the form of ' I did not say statement A '? Which is what you said exactly. Or in the form of ' Statement A is not true ' which I never claimed you said. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>The former, and no ; that is not exactly what I said.<br><b> S2:8-  </b>Explain your reasoning ; I have quotes which show the opposite. Or are you just trolling again? <br><b>S1:9-  </b>Reasoning? How about this : You do not have a quote of me denying that I said statement A.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Gravity explains the observation of gravity? No it doesn't, it merely describes it, and it is a fact. Same for electromagnatism. If a theory must explain then evolutionary theory is no theory at all. I heard that was a single point mutation.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I assumed that when I said that the theory of gravity explains the observations of gravity I had been clear enough. The observations are the facts. The theories explain the facts. Why don't you try to educate yourself about science before you speak. All scientific theories explain, by definition. theory : A set of statements or principles devised to explain a group of facts or phenomena. - American Heritage Science Dictionary and theory : An explanation for sets of phenomena that is developed by observation and experimentation. - Dictionary of Modern Biology I know the concept is pretty difficult for you to grasp, but try. Not really. It was a gene duplication and an alternative long open reading frame of an internally repetitious coding sequence. There does not appear to have been a point mutation. However, this is macro evolution since it created a new species ( Flavobacterium Sp. K 172 ). The actual new gene is located on the pOAD 2 plasmid. It produces a 392 - amino acid-long-residue bacterial enzyme. The original reading of the sequence produced a 472 - residue-long protein sequence. I believe that the original gene still produces this protein sequence. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>But it doesn't. Description is not explanation, even when one is able to describe as a single universal principle. Alright, why do masses exert attractive forces on each other? Confusion in general nomenclature ( as evidenced by the varying and sometimes contradictory definitions presented for scientific terms [ up to and including science and scientific themselves ] ) does not translate to my ignorance simply because I recognize them. Then give me ' the theory ' of gravity. Interesting, so you are saying that this thing lost 240 base pairs of data and then it could metabolize a byproduct of nylon which has like a three functional group similarity with lysine. I am really feeling the novelty. Oh and species is a badly defined term for sexually reproducing life forms, for prokaroyotes? It means nothing in this context.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Gravitation Only 1215 pages. I can't fit that information on this page and you wouldn't understand anyway. It is quite evident that you don't understand what science is or how it works and don't really want to learn. I'm not sure you can learn. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It's quite evident that you are unwilling to give me the explanation just as you have been unwilling to answer my criticisms of irrational evolution. Let it be known that I have a 5100 page response to anything you might possibly say that I don't like but since you wouldn't understand it I won't post it. ( Gosh that really is easy, you should write ' how to argue for dummies ' pandion :) ) Just in case that wasn't clear, I see your post as a fancy < flush >.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I knew that you would not understand my point. You seem to lack the education. Oh, well. Doesn't change the fact that in science, theories are explanations of observations that have been tested. Scientific theories aren't guesses as the uneducated believe. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I knew you would not answer. It seems even the uneducated can catch someone so well versed as yourself in a contradiction if they pay attention. This excuse doesn't change the fact that you refused to give the explanation for a phenomenon when you had already claimed there was an explanation. Then perhaps you will help pandion out, and explain gravity. Nice to see someone admit it. It does become tiresome to criticize the theory and be called ignorant of evidence due to this annoying dual use of the word. No, maxwells equations describe electromagnetism ; they do not explain them any deeper then the conceptual understanding of force fields and charges. I am not sure who said it, but once I was told science doesn't do ' why ' only ' how '. I didn't believe it, but perhaps if you need explain to mean describe a self-consistent if novel vernacular could be developed.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>But, there is not answer to meaningless gibberish. Entirely possible. But you haven't. Your gibberish isn't even meaningful to the discussion. I can't do anything about it if you lack the ability to understand. I have been trying to teach you but you don't seem to be able to learn. But gravity isn't evolution. Please try to pay attention. Don't be stupid. It is a matter of language that words have multiple meanings. Only the ignorant don't understand this fact. Since you are so ignorant of the topic, and refuse to make any effort to educate yourself, it is understandable that scientific terms that have different meanings from those that you understand are annoying. Any intelligent person is aware that dictionaries list several different meanings for a single word. Apparently, religious zealots don't know this. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Rhetorical dismissal, irrelevant. Not yet, because you saw it coming and refused to answer. Points for foresight, not intellectual honesty. You linked to a book on amazon, you call that trying? I did ask you about gravity though. Splendid! First I am ignorant because I supposedly don't understand that theories explain, and are not facts ; now I am ignorant because I don't realize that words can have different senses of meaning depending on context. Are you noticing any pattern here? Shall we look back and see which of us happened to make a universal statement about what theories are? Do you happen to know a possible fallacy that arises from using the same word in an argument in two different senses? Don't worry my teaching is better than yours, I'll actually answer my own rhetorical question for you. It's call equivocation. And to what discussion is this diatribe meaningful? Just to be clear, you are saying that if understood scientific terms, I would know that something like gravity or evolution would be both theory and observation?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Very poetic, but you're wrong. Additionally, your overuse of punctuation is disorienting. If you are going to use so much punctuation, please read up on how to properly place it. Yes. And no one has yet offered a shred of evidence that contradicts these interpretations. In addition, there is no competing theory. Perhaps, if you can come up with a theory that is equally valid, there will be doubt cast on current understanding. However, try as you might, that will not happen. In this case, we have the correct theory and there really is no debate at all. Humanity motivates science. Humanity rewards science. However, science is not colored by humanity. Science is the same everywhere there is intelligence to put it into process. Science has no color. It is in the best interest of scientists to search for the answers. If they had all the answers, they would not have much to do. This sounds like a statement from someone who only looks at conclusions and never evidence. You probably read the titles but not the report. I bet you come on here arguing without the faintest understanding of what the science actually is you claim we are guessing at. If you can, I invite you to pick a topic other than poetry and we can discuss.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Which part, that is why you should respond line by line. Always something isn't it. You don't seem to complain about ignorant ad hominems as much as perfectly valid grammar ( that you dislike ). Ah yes, who ever disagrees with you has not the faintest understanding of what science is... what scientist say :p <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Judging by the disorganized thought process, poor sentence structure and obscure statements that you present, I imagine you bulldozing through my responses line by line, taking each out of its context, responding to each as it stands alone, and completely failing to grasp what my point, which is contained in the whole of a paragraph, actually is ; therefore, although it will take much punctuation and careful sentence construction, I will start writing all my responses to you in single sentence form so that you can actually respond to what I am saying instead of what I am writing. He is clearly trying to sound eloquent and insightful. He has failed at both. Just pointing that out. Ok, I said this : To which you responded the above. This is what I am talking about. You make no sense. For someone who is obviously a Liberal Studies college dropout, you sure are poor at constructing your thoughts into words. Or maybe the English language is incapable of expressing the nonsense that goes on inside your brain. I'm still not sure.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Are you admitting to under use of punctuation? :p Does that mean you actually attempt to sound like a closed minded pseudo-intellectual lecturer? Ad hominem <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Statement makes no sense. It means I don't attempt to achieve something I am not intelligent enough to achieve out of fear of looking like a fool to someone who is. Idiotic<br><b> S2:3-  </b>And intellect is invisible to the man who has none.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>So you're stumped again on who your missing link is. Not surprised. OH YE OF GREAT FAITH!!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I am always perplexed, though not surprised, by your ability to take the fact that someone may not know something as evidence in favour of your own view. There is so much evidence of links all over the place. Just because one of them is still missing does nothing for your cause. You would have to actually produce evidence for your view to achieve that - something that neither you nor anyone else has ever done. Every time a new specimen is discovered to close a gap, you say " Aha! Look, now there are two gaps where there used to be one. " Your god of the gaps is getting very small indeed, and it appears that he is not the only thing round here that is very small indeed. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Oh yes it does. It busts your chops all day long. OH YE OF GREAT FAITH!!<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You clearly haven't the slightest clue how logic works. This is just more evidence ( of which there is plenty ) that ' you got nothing '. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>< Flush > You don't even know who yo daddies are. Your logic no doubt has to include a large foreheaded, foul-smelling, knuckle-dragging hunchback in your family tree. But that's gotta be by faith because you can't document it. OH YE OF GREAT FAITH!! :p<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Same old tripe as usual. You got no answer, you got nothing.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No. Anyone who sticks to beliefs that a god created the earth just 6,000 years ago is an idiot. People are free to believe that a god created the Earth billions of years ago though without deserving the " idiot " label. Hope this clarifies things for you.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So, one set of creationists are XXXXXX, but the others are not? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Well done Monty. Mark that up as your first ever 100% honest and accurate post here.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>How long have you been on these boards? So you support one group of creationists. Which theory / theories of creation do you think aren't supported by XXXXXX <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I signed up in May 2004. No. I suspect that there are XXXXXX that support all theories of creation. You are wandering into logical fallacy territory already Monty. Time to stop, engage your brain and re-read what I wrote then what you wrote. If you are still confused, I'd recomend a stint at studying set theory.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You've been pretty quiet then. [ QUOTE = Clive 14 ] I suspect that there are XXXXXX that support all theories of creation. [ / quot ] And any that support all the theories of evolution? Oddly enough, in post 11 you seemed to support my statement in relation to yours. I said you replied So, you do seem to support one group of creationists. But then you say that there are XXXXXX in all the groups. And that you don't support any. Why the flip? What has studying set-theory got to do with your own change of mind? Also, how do you know Lurch / Ungerdunn / Selasphorus / etc are the same person?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Are you then postulating ' true ' emptiness before the big bang?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Emptiness suggests that you have something with emptiness inside of it, before the big bang time did not exist and there was no volume of anything, it was truly nothing. We don't know what if anything exists " out side " of the universe or what came before the big bang, but what we do know suggests there was nothing, no space, no time, nothing. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Before... time did not exist, is a contradiction in terms. How does ' truly nothing ' imply the spontaneous generation of matter, energy, or dimension? You're in a state of delusion, nothing can suggest a contradiction like time exists as a value on itself. You mean a field that drops off exponentially from the source? I can easily imagine that. I don't even need to use the trick I mentioned before because I have been thinking about fields for so long. Alright, have fun with that point. My point is and has been that mr. michael is correct in everything he said. There can be no rational non-causality, the supposition of non-causality is the supposition of irrational universe. I maintain that a dimension being a value on itself is circular contradiction. I deny that 0 = 1 - 1 is a model from the generation of existance from non-existance. If anything it represents the ultimate neutrality of a system with respect to the arbitrary zero point. An area totally devoid of force fields classically cannot exist in a universe with charges.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well, I guess if you don't get it, you don't get it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Was your pretty graph supposed to convince me that the universe can't be understood? Perhaps I was to intuitively understand that you're right :p<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I know I won't be able to convince you of anything, I don't know why I keep trying, guess it's just a flaw in my nature. Universe can be understood ( with in limits ) it's just not going to present it self as something we can instantly visualize and understand intuitively. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Thanks, but wait ; who's on first? You might be able to convince me that you really want to honestly debate me, but I doubt it.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I don't know what you mean, how have I been dishonestly debating you? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>You constantly quit under the excuse that even though you made an assertion any opposition to it is too foolish to acknowledge. You attack the character, intelligence, education, knowledge, and objectivity of me and others. You make absurd statements like " When you're explaining you're losing " in response to the ( compared to you ) extraordinary effort to clarify my position to you.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I guess it worded that poorly, I what I meant to say is, what makes you think I am debating you? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Rofl!, I promise you I did laugh in the hearing of others when I read that. No, you're quite right ; it would be a mistake to say you've ever put enough effort into any post to describe it as trying to debate. That however is dishonest in itself given that you are expected to argue when you assert things on a debate site.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Would you say that last little exchange we had about visualization and intuition was honest? <br><b>S1:7-  </b>Dangerously close ( it was also suspiciously similar to explaining!!! ). Except that you said these things in the same string : Unsupported. Unsupported. Ad hominem Ad hominem Science is not all of one piece. I think those who set themselves against problems with such an extreme lack of hard data are setting themselves up to fail. It's of course still not excusable that they think they can throw out human logic if they think the math or the reasoning is leading them that way, because of course math and reasoning are human logic. Sounds an awful lot like Aquinas ' defense of faith in which he basically said that men have to use their reason to conclude that faith is the only way to achieve the divine truths of the universe.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It doesn'thave to spawn, but it does, thanks to the uncertainty principle. It's quantum fluctuations.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Stonewall, I know it was stated that there was nothing more to say, but I just like debating too much :) Besides, you brought up the uncertainty principle and I want to talk about that for a bit. I understand that the uncertainty principle, based on the probability of a wave function, states that it is inherently impossible for someone to find out the estimate of where the position of a particle is and its momentum at the same time. But why does this necessitate that the particle itself does not follow certain laws that determine its path? Isn't the inherent indetermination on the part of the observer not being able to predict the particles behavior? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It's not about us ( or the observer ) measuring it, it's about the way the particles actually act... it's a law of physics itself. Take our sun for instance. For the atoms in the sun to overcome the strong nuclear force and allow for hydrogen fusion, the temperature needs to be around 10 billion degrees K. The sun's temperature, though, is only about 15 million degrees K... The gravity that is crushing these atoms ( and causing the heat ) is putting the hydrogen nuclei into a very tiny box, which severely limits where the protons can be found ( meaning the momentum and position don't have a lot of options here ). Because of this, the uncertainty principle allows protons to jump out of the nucleus in what is know as tunneling. Without the uncertainty principle, the sun wouldn't shine at all. It doesn't matter that there is no observer in the middle of the sun to see it, it is the simple principle that causes these particles to act sporadically.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You think that observing has nothing to do with it? Aren't you getting off track with what Heisenberg himself said? What about wave-function collapse? The very act of observing collapses the wave function. Where are you coming from, Copenhagen or Decoherence? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Did I say that observation has nothing to do with the uncertainty principle? No. I understand the wave-function collapse, and I already made reference to it in this thread with the double slit experiment... but it isn't about the observer. As I showed with tunneling, it's a real law of nature and will affect the way particles act whether anyone observes them or not. The particle can't allow itself to be in a position where both its momentum and position are known, regardless if anyone is actually there to do the measurement. You were implying that particles may behave ' rationally ' and that it is the observations that make them seem crazy, but that is completely incorrect. They actually behave ridiculously no matter what, and that is the beauty of it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But isn't this quantum indeterminacy resolved through observation? I mean, your using the uncertainty principle as a basis to say that quantum events are uncaused sporadic fluctuations ( particles popping into existence ) right? How exactly does collapsing the wave function play into this? If it is observed, do particles all of sudden behave deterministic?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Bull Your equation is not modeling something equals nothing any more than 42 models the universe. This kind of insane interpretation of an equation is what has some people's views on QM in trouble with me. Observe, 1 - 1 = 0 Let X = 1 - 1 Then X = 0 Then X = nothing ( according to you ) 1 - 1 = 0 = > X = X Which is to say nothing = nothing and also to say that something = something Now by you perverse logic of saying that the equation models something from nothing it also models something from something which would mean ( in your crazy mind ) that something must come from something. I don't know how many times it is going to take before you realize that something = nothing is a contradiction, that nothing is modeled by a null set in mathematics and logic and not zero. A root is not defined by ' when the equation is nothing ' it is when the equation is zero.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Freedom, the equation is an analogy. You have negative energy and you have positive energy. You have matter and antimatter as well. You have E = mc ^ 2. This is really not that difficult and by no means am I first person to bring this concept to light. And also, so what if something = something and nothing = nothing. What is violated here? Look, I have 1 iota of negative energy. I then add 1 iota of positive energy. What am I left with? Did I really need to spell this out? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>What is violated here was already expounded by mr michael quite well. Something is nothing is contradiction, mathematically and logically ( what's the difference ). Neutrality or zero value does not mean nothing.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Will you please, I repeat please, use your brain. Did I ever say something is nothing? No I did not. This is not a difficult concept to grasp and your just being a brat. All you ever do is disagree. You never offer anything other than incoherent childish retorts. I found a link for you. Please read it. ASP : A Universe from Nothing <br><b>S1:3-  </b>-----------------------------------------------------<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You know what I mean. Find where I said something is nothing. You're playing with semantics and as usual have nothing of any substance to say. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You're drawing a distinction between is and = and I am playing with semantics?!<br><b>S1:1-  </b>you are reasoning in a way similar to archie. Archie is a believer in the antromorphic principle you are a believer that life is an entity that materialises everywhere it gets a chance, kind of God like. How come we have found no evidence of life anywhere else in the universe?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Uh... because we've only begun exploring it and are still pretty much stuck on this speck of dust? There is simply no reason to believe that life itself might not be common, but maybe by far the most common examples of life are simple microbial ones. We wouldn't expect to detect them at present even if every solar system had at least one example. More and more complex life is likely ( if the earth's history is a typical one ) to be increasingly more improbable, known to have existed only in about the last 500 million years of the 3 - 4 billion years of life on earth. And technologically adept life has only existed for the last few hundred years. If you imagine the history of life as extending from your shoulder to your fingertip, chopping off the fingers would wipe out most complex life, while while a single swipe of a nail file would wipe out human civilisation. So asking why we haven't detected life out there yet is not a very telling question. Space could be teeming with microbial life, but we weren't aware of it even on earth till the microscope was invented. Our telescopes just aren't good enough. And not all life leaves an oxygen signature, only photosynthetic life. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>plenty of speculation but not a shred of evidence<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Like your god, huh. :) At least with ET life, we have some hope of proving whether it is there or not! <br><b>S1:3-  </b>all religions are founded on hope which is faith by another name.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>If faith were identical to hope, then we would have only two virtues instead of three. Free thinkers can certainly have hope and charity. It's much harder for us to have faith in what we can't test. I don't have faith in politicians I can't test ; why would I change my habits of mind for your deity?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Your challenge is so easy, I'm surprised you even bothered. Your whole world view is based on one assumption that has no hard evidence whatsoever. The existence of an almighty deity. Did you really think that it would be difficult to show that you are the one who is making assumptions that effect everything you believe? However, very few assumptions are made when dealing with scientific evidence. If someone were to look at your scientific evidence and find a glaring assumption had been made then you would be laughed out of the scientific community. It may be true that some of the more far reaching theories have gaps, due to unknowns, but to throw out all scientific knowledge from the base up just because we don't know everything is very short-sighted indeed. Smiley PS Make the next challenge a bit more of a.... challenge.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Again you allow your ignorance and denial of your spiritual humanity to cause you to make another incorrect assumption. And you do it with such bravado, it is laughable. I have first hand evidence that is available to all who seek it personally. The key word is PERSONALLY. God does not perform for crowds all the time regarding His personal love for us but He will always make a private appearance for those who will just seek Him personally. So don't think I am just hoping I will be proven right someday. I know I'm right regarding our origins and am just waiting for the precise details to be made clear to me. But this I do know for certain. That you are 110% wrong in you pseudo man made science that completely excludes the author of life in your equations. That much you can bet your soul on. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>So I was right. No real evidence.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Like I said smiley, I have my evidence and it's overwhelming. You need to seek it yourself and if you are sincere, you will receive it too. Besides, any evidence I present will only be scoffed at and rejected out of hand. But denying what I have personally experienced is a fools errand. But then again, coming from your ilk, it's par for the course. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Ever hear of Peter Sutcliffe? He had enough evidence of the existence of his god to go out and butcher 13 women. It certainly overwhelmed him. It's possible that he was delusional. But then again... Let's just hope your god doesn't ask anything similar of you. Smiley<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Smiley, if you weren't so utterly clueless regarding what it means to be born again you would actually be funny. But as it stands you are seriously pathetic for even attempting to lay this psychopath at Gods door in any way. During the time of their courtship, Sutcliffe had developed an obsession with prostitutes that he indulged together with a friend, Trevor Birdsall, and they spent a large portion of their spare time cruising red-light districts in the Yorkshire area. This obsession continued after their marriage and the acquisition of his HGV licence in June 1975, and his subsequent work as a lorry driver, took him away from home more than ever, enabling him to indulge his obsession without fear of detection. There is speculation that a bad experience with a prostitute, during one of these forays, led to the violent hatred of these women that resulted in the death of thirteen women, and the vicious attack of seven others. This is just such a great example of why it is a waste of time even attempting to reason with people with such limited understanding of who born again believers are to even think that this demon possessed sociopath was told to do this by God. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>He certainly believed in god, as he had had personal contact with him. So, did you happen to miss that bit? Or perhaps it was too inconvenient for you. Smiley<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Talks cheap smiley, I'm saying that if he truly had personal contact with the real and living God, he would have witnessed to those women rather than first pay them for illicit sex as he cheated on his wife and then butchered 13 of them because he had a bad experience with one of them. What I truly marvel at though about all of you hypocrites is that in all of my posts when i insist i have a personal relationship with God that is based on unconditional love, you demand proof. And yet, with this obscure serial killer who claims God told Him to do it and you hold him up as a believable example of what a christian is. Do you see why you are a tool of satan and an enemy of the God of love, and of all that is good and righteous? You are seeped in darkness and spiritual death.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>We have done much more than rely on Telescopes in our search for life. Voyager is a good example of our continuing search to the edge of our Solar System and beyond. http://www.google.com/url?q=http://v...7hh5vgs_yiA_2A And isn't it true that scientists have dated the Universe by looking back to the beginning with Telescopes and extrapolating its age based on the speed that light travels from then until now and here? Did they account for the effect Solar Winds would have on the speed of light? Or the effect the varrying densities of the Space that light traveled through had on its speed over sucha vast distance? Of course they didn't and couldn't as that information is impossible to compile as it is a statistical unknown with no way to determine over such an incredibly vast distance of Space. So how do some confidently state that the Universe is 14 billion years old? They can't with any confidence. Yet they do. http://www.space.com/scienceastronom...se_030103.html<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Not exactly, but you don't care about the actual science so I won't try to explain it to you. We'll just use your erroneous example, since it's really close enough for this discussion. They can and do take those things into account. That's why they say it's 14 billion years old, instead of 14.12437845682376534756 billion. There are some factors that we can't pin down exactly, and they add a small degree of uncertainty. That uncertainty might add up to 100 million years. But out of 14 billion, that's not really a big problem. There is NO way the uncertainty could, for example, turn 14 billion into 6 thousand. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>So my example is erroneous but it's close enough not to correct huh? If it's so erroneous you would jump on the chance to prove me wrong. But even when I'm right, you must attempt to imply I am wrong. You're a perfect example of a philosophical coward kronos. So post a link saying my questions are incorrect if you can. And if you can't, stop making assertions you can't back up. Prove any of these huge assumptions. Don't you get it that none of what you are saying can be proven absolutely? You are placing a tremendous amount of faith in what you are saying above. None of which can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt by a preponderance the evidence. Huge assumptions must be made and held on to in order to accept most all of what this type of science asserts to be reasonable conclusions.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The measurments are based on the red shift of light, not on the speed of light. There, you now know as much as you did before, and everyone else has further proof of the quality of your debates and scientific knowledge. :) Pretty much everyone else who read what I wrote understood it, and you don't want to understand it. You have no idea how big any assumptions are, or even what the assumption are, or how hard it would be to prove something, nor do you want to know. I'm right, aren't I? If you cared about learning you'd be asking questions, not making blatantly false claims. I've shown everyone what they already knew, that your claim is invalid. If you want me to explain it to you let me know, but don't expect me to waste time with you if all you're going to do is chant " nu-uh! " Prove to me you want to learn and I'll teach you, otherwise I have better things to do. I know you'll call that a retreat, but again, everyone else recognizes the truth of the matter, so your accusations will fall on deaf ears. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You realize this rant is completely unresponsive and argumentative while adding nothing of substance to my response to you. How easily you speak for everyone else rather than respond to me directly. By the way, do you have a link explaining this red shift of light or am I supposed to just take the word of a XXXX hard who likes to think he's intelligent? And what blatantly false claims did I make? All I did was ask questions. SEE, here is what you're responding to?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>And here we have it again! Folks, I'm still searching for the exact word to describe Archie's response here. That irony plus thing I was talking about before, where he attacks a behavior that describes himself so perfectly. A cookie for whoever figures it out!<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I could care less about proving the flood. All I care about is disproving your crackpot, unsuported theory.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Well that's obvious. Certainly nobody thought you cared about truth. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No I care about it... but since creation was not a scientific event, it cannot be proven scientifically. As far as the flood goes, I am not a geologist nor an archeologist, thus, I am not able to attempt to prove it.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, you don't. You just told us that all you care about is disproving evolutionary theory ( even though your representation of it is nothing like what evolutionary theory actually is ). Even if you hadn't belied your intent with that " slip of the tongue, " we can tell that much from the fact that you repeatedly post absolute rubbish, misrepresented quotes, and inaccurate descriptions of evolutionary theory. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I know it's sometimes hard for you evolutionists to follow along... but I do care about creation but there is no way I can prove it scientifically.... thus I have no motivation to attempt to prove it in that way. The creation of the world was not a scientific event... it was a spiritual event... which is why you cannot explain it scientifically either.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Hey, you're the one saying things and then taking them back. You can't even keep up with your own statements. Then you lied. Of course you can't, and for the same reason you can't prove that 2 + 2 = 5 : it isn't true. Yet here you are repeatedly posting all sorts of nonsense about evolution. But you have no motivation, huh? Only in your delusional worldview. See below. I have supporting evidence. You have nothing but special pleading and supposed miracles.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It's called reasonable doubt, Calli. You don't need a video of a person committing murder to convict them.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Aaahhh, yes... but you do need IRREFUTIBLE evidence, don't you? Wouldn't you call creationism an " alternative theory "? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Evidence = genetic relatedness of organisms, fossils, observed examples of change. It was a couple of hundred years ago until it was completely destroyed.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That's a nice definition, but is the evidence IRREFUTIBLE? I don't think so. Or evolution blindly accepted because no one wants to admit that there is a God... ( Consequences are such scary things. ) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It's not a definition. It was examples of evidence which support the model. Are you completely unable to defend the scraps of Creationism? Evolution does not even deny the possibilities of god. And why create fairy tale consequences when they don't exist?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>IRREFUTIBLE EVIDENCE? How am I not defending the " scraps of Creationism "? I have only heard of a few instances where Christians believed in God using evolution. It contradicts the Bible, so that doesn't work. Where are you going when you die? Are you just going to rot in the grave like your buddy gilligan? Or are you going to hell? How do you know for sure where you're going? The Bible tells us where we ( believers ) are going. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Have you refuted the evidence presented? You offer no positive evidence towards Creationism nor did you deny that the idea of Creationism as scientific was destroyed long ago. That's odd, since most churches, including the largest one ( Catholicism ) allow their followers to accept evolution. Reality contradicts the Bible. As does the Bible. No, I plan on being cremated. Nope.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>What evidence? How about the flood? It was not " destroyed long ago ". People simply have begun to believe in evolution because they either : 1. ) Don't want to believe that the entire Bible is true. 2. ) They don't want to believe the Bible at all. Catholics are not Christian. They are Catholic. Maybe you should read some of the old posts between " Sarah " and I. We've already covered this topic. ( Several times. ) Same thing. You'll decompose either way. How do you know that? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>The fossil, genetic, and observed evidences that scientists base the theory of evolution on. Yes it was. The Noachian flood did not occur. Ignoring the obvious impossibilities of the ship / animals / etc, we see that the results a global flood would have caused do not exist. People have been indifferent toward the Bible long before evolution was discovered. Biology wasn't made to try to refute Biblical claims. Hell is a mythical location.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Oh, so you're telling me that all of that " evidence " is 100% true and beyond a reason of a doubt? I see results. I see lakes in the middle of continents with no rivers leading to them. How did they get there? BIOLOGY wasn't made to try to refute Biblical claims, evolution was. How do YOU know that? Can you PROVE it? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Huh? Yes, evidence is 100% evidence. That is not a prediction made by the global flood hypothesis. It can also be explained by climate changes. Rivers dry up. Biology IS evolution. Sure. Myth : An unproven or unverifiable person / place / thing which is believed to be true.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Crim : Let me refrase myself. Do you have complete and error free evidence that evolution took place? ( Links between apes and man are obviously missing. ) I don't see any large lakes being formed today. ( Without the help of rivers, streams, etc. ) Oh really... biology : a branch of knowledge that deals with living organisms and vital processes I don't see the synonym " evolution " anywhere in that definition. Some biologists may study evolution, but biology is NOT evolution. Okay, what I meant to say is that you can't use the Catholic church as an example showing that the majority of Christians believe in evolution. ( ' Cause the Catholics don't believe a lot of things in the Bible. ) There is a hell. I just hope that you don't have to find out the hard way. Thistown : Sorry ' bout that. I was really tired and not thinking strait... see my post to Crim. See above... <br><b>S1:7-  </b>We know for certain that organisms change over time. No serious scientist ignores the fact of evolution. Biology is centered around the theory of evolution. Without it, biology is hardly biology. Of course I can. Catholics are the largest group of Christians and they are allowed to accept evolution. Here are some other denominations which have supported evolution in past court cases : United Methodist, Episcopal, Presby, and Southern Baptist. Also, most Jewish groups. Evidence please.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>Let's make this more simple for you. Show me one verifiable link between ape and man. So biology didn't exist before the theory of evolution was formulated? Fallacy of division. ( Look it up. ) The Bible. Thistown : The truth hurts. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Since humans are classified as great apes already, can you specify what you mean by ape? Not as we know it now. lol, my comments weren't even close to the fallacy of division You quiestioned evolution being compatible with Christianity. I showed that most Christian denominations do not dismiss it. It was a completely valid point. The Bible is not evidence.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Explain to me how those products would not have been developed if the belief that all life evolved from a common ancestor never existed.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I'd expect that from a dishonest creationist coward. Way to ignore the issue here. All of those products stem from applying the various sciences within evolution together through an evolutionary view. Creationism however, has absolutely nothing outside of publishing. A key determinant of validity in science is whether or not it can be made tangible. Creationism has nothing in that sense while evolution has hundreds. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Typical answer from a dishonest socially-inept evolutionist coward. Ignoring the real issue. Those products could still have been applied without the belief that all life evolved from a common ancestor. But I already know you're nothing but a dishonest coward so I won't expect you to provide any meaningful response.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I'm not the one deliberately changing the subject to avoid having to discuss the original post. Btw, thanks for proving that creationists rely on dishonesty. Except that those fields of science in which those discoveries were made didn't exist without evolutionary theory. Many came from interdisciplinary fields united by evolutionary theory. Without that tie, we don't have those discoveries. Not to mention that many of those sciences are directly contradictory to literal creationism. The search for gas and oil deposits follows that of evolution, where diatoms lived, evolved and died in large concentrations, where large ancient swamps and forests were. Literal genesis however, doesn't suggest hydrocarbon formation, it argues that such deposits were created by the the flood. Aside from the sheer idiocy of that argument as it completely ignores physics, oil and gas deposits should, under that theory, be randomly scattered or should be evenly distributed everywhere. Obviously that is untrue. Literal Genesis viewpoints reject the necessary sciences to come to such findings and commercial products. So, no, you are wrong. Wrong again. I see you refuse to post in the informal challenge. Not surprising from a coward creationist. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I did not change the subject and you're the one who's dishonest. Biological evolution can be studied independent of the belief that all life evolved from a common ancestor. Wrong. You're using false dichotomies. You're assuming that if literal creation is not true, then that validates the theory of evolution, something that you accused creationists of doing. Hypocrite. I have never stated that I believe in creationism in any shape, way or form.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Because I said so! What are you, archangel? Did you really just say that? So the study of the change in species from one species to another can be done without the belief that species came from common ancestors? Really? The belief in a common ancestor is the study of biological evolution. It is simply an issue of how far one goes back. If two species evolved from one, and another species and that one evolved from a common one, how exactly are you going to propose we ignore history? Prove to me how geology is not contradictory to literal genesis. Explain to me how biology is not contradictory to literal genesis. Explain to me how astronomy is not contradictory to literal genesis. Show me a science that SUPPORTS literal genesis. The fabulous thing about evolution is that it can and has adapted to new finds in science. Modern evolution is very different from the ideas originally set forth by Darwin. But you, as a person who thinks that creationwiki is valid wouldn't know that. While it is possible that there is another alternative, the world was dominated by Literal Genesis. That does not support any of the sciences required. http://www.4forums.com/political/331779-post15.html try again. ALL TOS violations will be reported. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You're the one who's using " I said so " arguments. You have yet to make a single statement that makes sense. all observed changes can simply be explained by changes in traits, without the belief of a common ancestor Wrong. evolution - Definitions from Dictionary.com learn your definitions and then post Fallacy of changing the subject. I never argued for literal genesis. You've ignored the fact that you've used a fallacy as well as multiple lies. Fallacy of changing the subject again. You have yet to show how the common ancestor belief has contributed in any way, shape or form to science or non-publication commercial products. You fail. You're ignoring the fact that you've used a false dichotomy, something you've accused others of doing. you're a hypocrite, and a bad one at that just because I disagree with talkorigins about an asinine list doesn't mean I disagree with them about everything. resorting to labelling is one of the most pathetic things you can do in a debate<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Translation : I can't deal with post #19, so I'm going to pretend whatever I wish to make myself feel better. Except that you need to know the common ancestor, or ancestors to know which traits are new. How can you study biological evolution without knowing the ancestors? So no, you are wrong. LOL. You think that the dictionary definition of evolution is the same as biological evolution? TROLL ALERT. Name me a theory other then Evolution which is supported by current sciences. Or retract your statement. Yay! I'm going to pretend post #19 doesn't exist. I'm going to pretend that interdisciplinary sciences fused by evolution don't exist. I'm going to pretend that sciences on their own, not looking through evolution came to those conclusions! TROLL ALERT. Incorrect again. You claimed that those findings could have come outside of an evolutionary view. The problem is that there was no other view other then literal creationism. Therefore you are wrong as there was only two major players in town. As literal creationism wouldn't have resulted in them, you are again, wrong. Okay, what do you agree with them on? And why are you refusing to state that Literal Creationism is a factless science that has no products? You are so hiding.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What denomination are you?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I'm a Christian. What denomination are you? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I'm a Luthuran. A denomination is " a large group of religious congregations united under a common faith and name and organized under a single administrative and legal hierarchy. " (dictionary.com ) So you didn't answer my question, and I suspect you never will. I was just wondering what type of church you attended. Would you consider yourself a Theistic evolutionist?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I think it's spelled " Lutheran. " Roman Catholics don't have denominations. We're just Christians. Roman Catholic. I consider myself a Christian. BTW, if you are a Lutheran, you should know what your denomination teaches about it : On the other hand there are those who can no more close their eyes to the evidence which substantiates some kind of lengthy evolutionary process in the opinion of the vast majority of those scientists most competent to judge than they could deny the awesome reality of God's presence in nature and their own experience of complete dependence upon the creative and sustaining hand of God revealed in the Scriptures. The Encyclopedia of the Lutheran Church, published by the Lutheran World Federation <br><b>S1:3-  </b>( post #56 ) ( post #70 ) That's strange, Pandion has corrected me on spelling before, while making two to three times as many spelling errors himself. ( post #75 ) ( post #77 ) The one thing that " true orthodox Christians " like The Barbarian seem to always have going for them is immediate backup by a militant atheist. The militant atheist introduces us to a book, and two hours later the orthodox Christian is quoting from it. Is there anything at all that you two actually disagree on?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>This is probably a hard concept for you, but truth is truth, no matter who says it. Something creationists and atheists seem to agree on ; " science and Christianity are not compatible. "<br><b>S1:1-  </b>According to creationists, Darwinism is a religion. Religions must be believed by their adherents to be inerrant. That new evidence can lead to changes in scientific beliefs is very confusing for your average creationist.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That's rich! On two other fora, it was raised by evolutionaries as a criticism of Christianity - the issue of eating shellfish. It was supposed that because the Old Testament prohibits the eating of shell-fish that Christians are hypocritical for doing so now. When a reply is put forward that man's understanding of the wish of God has changed, the say therefore the whole religion is in error! Now you're using that as a defence! Man is trying to understand the essentially unknowable God. As we progress, that understanding changes. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>On one of the other forums that you are referring to, you were insisting that morality was absolute based on God's will. There you were the one arguing in favor of absolutes, so it was permissible to bring up the inconsistencies and arbitrariness of Church doctrine. Here, no one is making any claim as to the " absolute " nature of the theory of evolution. That theories change with time, or even discarded, as new evidence is uncovered ( or old evidence understood ) is part of the nature of science.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You've seen my stuff before? Where on www.abc.net.au? or creationtalk? Why didn't you say ' hi '? Anyway, this is a fair point I'm making. The eating of shell-fish is not an absolute. It was a law given to the Jews at a certain time. If such laws were absolute then they would have been given to Adam - i.e. from the beginning. Certain Church doctrine too is not absolute as we gain in our understanding of God. Arbitrary is such a loaded word and bespeaks of your bias towards the Church. It is difficult for me to argue against evolutionary theory when the theory itself is in total flux. It is difficult for me to understand the dogged defence it gets, when what you are defending today, could in fact be shown wrong tomorrow. Just as when Darwin and Huxley first had a go at Christianity, they knew nothing about irreducibly complex systems. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>CreationTalk, where I posted as the primitive hominid. I didn't say hi since I was curious whether you'd recognize me. But, hello Montalban. I hope you've been well. Anyway, my intention was not to derail the topic of this thread. Just to clarify that criticizing the belief system that changes is valid if it claims somehow to be absolute, but science always admits to being a changing enterprise.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>A generalisation with regard to Christianity. There are in deed absolutes, but there is no absolute really as to what all of them are. Most Christians would agree... there is a God Jesus is the Son of God Jesus came to earth as Man and died for us and for our salvation - and he rose again on the third day. However, it is not an absolute ( as far as I can see ) whether my priest has a beard, whether he faces the congregation at one point, and turns his back at another point. Likewise I don't believe that whether the earth is flat or not, or at the centre of the solar system is an issue. Further, I believe in a literal six day creation, but I'm not sure if Orthodox teaching means that the earth is young or not... Some monk tried to use the Bible to age the earth and came up with 7,000 years or so. I am not certain if this is Orthodox teaching. Certainly the six days is. Certain also is the fact that God is the creator.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>But when science presupposes no creator in it's " naturalisic " quest to make all its discoveries....<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You know, there are only so many times we can explain this to you, marc. If you simply refuse to give any weight to our points, even when you are utterly incapable of providing any reason not to accept them, there's really not much else we can do. May I recommend Dr. Kenneth Miller's book, Finding Darwin's God? Once again, just because you don't like certain facts doesn't make those facts false. I don't really want to delve too deeply into politics here, but the ignorance of the public ( and by ignorance I mean " lack of knowledge, " not " utter stupidity " ) regarding certain issues is not a sufficient reason for people in the know to play dumb. You elect representatives to educate themselves on the matter and make the decision for you. The U.S. is not a democracy, it's a republic ; and ( to paraphrase Churchill ) even though it sucks, it's better than any alternative. Ask Miller if he thinks Tiktaalik was a victory for atheism. Go ahead. Ask Catholics. Ask other theistic evolutionists. Or even ask an atheist who understands the implications of such things, because you obviously don't. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>From the link in post #1 of this thread ; This scientific study attempts to CLOSE gaps in the fossil record to show evidence of NO HIGHER POWER. Simple logic tells us that this study presupposed no creator. I guess you can, if that's all you can do. If you're incapable of condensing it and putting it into your own words in a brief way here, showing how Miller addresses the words " hope " and " fear ". I can see why you don't want to delve into politics too deeply - it may show you to be a liberal! :p Miller doesn't post here. I'm asking GazzaElliot. We'll give him more time - it obviously stumped you.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Your interpretation of the quote is belied by the quote itself, despite the fact that you cited the quote in its entirety. Filling gaps is a XXXX to those who believe that gaps are evidence of a higher power ; filling gaps is not in any way an attempt to disprove the existence of a higher power. But hey, you don't get simple logic, so what should we expect? Sorry, I've made it a point not to cater too much to your ignorance. If you want to deny that Miller actually believes the things he writes, you go right ahead. Frankly, your pulling out the " incapable " card is laughable at best. A non-response thinly-veiled as a backhanded ad hominem. Believe me, you're not fooling anybody.. except maybe yourself. You asked the question, and the mere existence of beliefs like those of Miller's refutes your assertion. If you dared take off your rose-tinted glasses regarding this evolution = atheism crusade of yours, you'd understand my point. However, as I pointed out earlier, your willful ignorance and close-mindedness render these conversations a lot like doing this : <br><b>S1:3-  </b>We just have different definitions of simple logic, that's all. You sometimes do a great job of answering your own posts. Read GazzaElliott's posts - you could learn something about debating.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But my definition is one that conforms to reality. I have to, because you never seem to do too well. In fact, if you had bothered to pay attention to my explanation of my use of the word ignorance in post 195, you'd have realized that I meant not " utter stupidity " but rather " lack of knowledge " ( in your case due to completely ignoring all disliked points ). Instead, you simply proved my point. What's this, yet another non-response with a thinly-veiled ad hominem attack? Now everyone can see why I have to answer my own posts...<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I think that you are correct. While 99.9% of scientists are not creationists, it is alsonot safe to say that 99.9% of all ordained ministers and pastors ARE creationists. I have known many ordained ministers and pastors, ( Lutheran, Catholic, Methodist, Presbyterian ) that I knew when I was young or with whom I was stationed in the military or that I have known since. Most of whom were friends. None of them were " creationists " in the sense that you mean. All were men of God and Christians, and all accepted evolutionary theory as correct.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So the ordained ministers and pastors that you knew : Luthuran, Catholic, Methodist, Presbyterian, rejected not only the book of Genesis, but the books of Psalms, Jeremiah, Acts, Romans, First Timothy, Ephesians, James, and others? ( Creation is mentioned all throughout the Bible ). Did they believe in any of the Bible at all? How did they become ordained? Fundamentalist cults are the only ones who believe in the Bible? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Now you are being insulting and silly. Why play dumb? The narrow view of your particular cult is not generally held by most Christians. You are trying to pretend that " creationist " means anyone who believes in God as Creator. It doesn't. " Creationism " arose in the 1960 s as an anti-science movement, and " creation science " was invented in an effort to force the teaching of a particular cult religion in public schools. I think that the clergymen that I have known were better Christians than you. Also, more educated in the history and the theology of Christianity than you. It has nothing to do with belief in the Bible. It has to do with a failure to educate oneself in the history and the sources of the Bible.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If there's ever a prize for word games on these forums, your statement that I highlighted above would have to take it. SO IT'S POSSIBLE TO BELIEVE IN A CREATOR, YET NOT BE A CREATIONIST, ACCORDING TO YOU. It's no wonder naturalistic evolution is an " established " fact. Evolutionists seem to really have a way with words. If the ordained ministers and pastors that you knew believed in God as creator, ( BUT WERE NOT CREATIONISTS, DARN IT ) do they believe in naturalistic evolution? Do they believe that life originated from water as evolutionists seem to favor more and more, and also that man was formed from the " dust of the ground " as the Bible says? You said you knew them - come on tell me tell me, this oughta be good!!! <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yes. Most certainly. At least not in the common sense of the word, someone who believes that the earth was created from nothing in 6 days about 6000 years ago or some such mythology. It is foolish to believe that the Bible contains the literal account of how God created, especially since there are two different creation stories. Now what are you talking about. Since evolution has been observed, yes, it is a fact. The theory of evolution is the scientific explanation of why it happens. Yes. They did. I used to discuss it quite a bit with the chaplain of my artillery group ( Lutheran ). He lived in the BOQ and we used to spend lots of time on long drives to outlying batteries. He was smart enough to realize that the Bible can't be literally true in every detail - it isn't history, except in that it is the record of the Hebrew people with their Deity. From it we learn moral lessons. We learn that God is the Creator, not how he created. Science is working to explain how. Sure. Life probably originated in the water. It is silly to claim that man is dirt. No wonder christians have always been so willing to treat others as dirt. Wipe the foam off.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I knew it would be good. Creationists are only those who question atheist encroachment in our society. If a person believes in a creator, yet pays little attention to the politics of atheism, then they're not a creationist? - they're not subject to your creationist attacks. ( I wonder if they're offended, or take exception when you riducule creation. ) I don't think I've said anything about the exact time period the earth was created, or exactly how literal I believe the Bible to be, not only in this thread, but anywhere on these forums, ever. New heights for Strawman. Evolution definition number 389256. There are no moral lessons in it, if God is not the creator. God's creation of man ( however it happened ) is the foundation for all knowledge and moral lessons in the Bible. I am a Luthuran, and I know that Martin Luthur knew that much. EXPLAIN HOW??? I thought science and religion were separate!! You've changed your mind about God being the creator? Should we have religion in science classes now? Wouldn't that help them explain it? I knew it was gonna be good!!!<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No, but abiogenesis does, and they are 2 sides of the same coin as they are presented as one process following the other. It is so deceptive and disingenuous to constantly separate them as unique processes while all the time knowing that one study is the scientific continuation where the other ends. You are playing a game of semantics in order to claim they aren't connected while all the while knowing that one study directly and specifically follows the other and build upon its claims as it continues on the explanation of how life evolved from single celled life forms. So stop with the denial and word games and face the truth for once in your life.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I know I'm presenting facts to Archie, sorry... Archie, in point of fact you have it backwards. The theory of evolution was first, then abioegenesis. We know life exists. Darwin, and others, explained how life changed from what it used to be to what it is now ; they had no concern for where it came from in the first place, they simply knew that it came from somewhere. How did they know it came from somewhere? Because there's life here now! The answer to the question of where it all started didn't get seriously studied until well after Darwin. So no, the one does not pick up from the other, and the study of evolution does not in any way depend on abiogenesis. Evolution doesn't care where life came from, only what happens to it once it's around. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Again you distort the facts in order to support your warped perspective. I wasn't discussing which science existed first, I was explaining which process comes first. And the process of abiogenesis preceded evolution, if either of them were in fact true and accurate at all. Which they aren't.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I was responding to what you wrote. If you can't explain your ideas clearly it isn't my fault. Don't expect me to read your mind. Edit : But of course this response serves me right for acting as if Archie was some sort of actual debater. I knew better, I went ahead anyway, and tada! <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You constantly prove how dishonest or ignorant you are kronus. And let's not forget that famous kronus hypocrisy that your name represents so consistently around here. Note the bolded in the posts below. I was speaking to the processes of abiogenesis and evolution. Now anyone need do is follow the flow of the attacks you proceed to make and it's very obvious that you're purposely attempting to distort what I said. This whole post proves that it is you who is either exactly what you're attempting to accuse me of being, or worse, you're just a blatant liar by attempting to purposely misinterpret what I have said here because I perfectly explained myself clearly and concisely. Yet you claim I didn't. Now do you want to keep embarrassing yourself, or should we drop this childishness as you apologize for being such a sarcastic jerk?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I usually ignore these rants, but when Archie uses this to assert how clear and concise he is? Sorry, I just can't pass it up!<br><b>S1:1-  </b>go back to the post where you said " abiogenesis is an integral part of evolutionary theory ". then view my reply of links disproving that statement, including the link YOU POSTED in order to try and prove that very statement. tell me, how have ants served you today at all? made you a sandwich? you were the one claiming God put every animal on the earth to serve us, so back that statement up by telling me how ants, cockroaches, fruitflies, earwigs, centipedes, termites and grasshoppers have served you. all of them, because remember, God put all of them on the earth to serve us. did grasshoppers make your shoes? i am the one claiming they are NOT here to serve us, they all make up the intricate biosphere, and we are a part of that family - there are no slaves. you realize that when we sequence the DNA of any animal, they ALL fall into a hierarchy, right?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>WOW, your ignorance and narcissism is astounding. But I shouldn't be surprised that your secular humanistic mind can only think in terms of what affects you directly as an individual mattering to you specifically. It doesn't work that way with me at all. I learned long ago that we either rise together as a species or we fall together. That means that each and every creature on Earth has a purpose in balancing the chain of life with whatever contributions their lifecycle contributes to the environment they live in. Ants aerate the earth and scavenge living and dead insects which serves a valuable service to the world. And every insect you mentioned above contributes to a balanced ecosystem in their own way so they most definitely benefit me personally with their existence. And I will hate to see the impact mass animal extinctions have on us and our planet / chain of life when the Tribulation period starts and massive segments of animal species are wiped out through war and pestilence. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>way to change your argument from ' all animals are here " to serve our needs " ' to ' all animals serve the purpose of " balancing the chain of life " '. FENCE POST MOVER!! you and freedom could be best friends.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>IT'S THE SAME THING, MONGO!!! Unless someone is as self centered as you apparently are. Is it beyond you to grasp that because all animals contribute to a balanced chain of life, they also serve our needs as human beings even if we don't consume some of them for food? But I'm hard pressed to name any animal, insect or bird that isn't consumed by some culture somewhere on earth. I myself have been offered chocolate covered ants in my lifetime, and it is common knowledge that insects are high in protein and recommended eating if one is in the wild and hungry. It is also common knowledge that other cultures find insects to be a delicacy. So I haven't moved any fence post at all, you just refuse to, or are incapable of grasping my point, as usual. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>i never said anything about eating or food ( other than ants making you a sandwich ). how about parasitic organisms? tapeworms - how do they serve us?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Truthfully, I don't know, but since I'm not the end all and be all of human knowledge I don't feel obligated to have to come up with an answer for that. Besides, I'm not even sure those examples fall into the category of animals beneficial to the chain of life since they are parasites rather than animals found in the wild. They live off of animals rather than as creatures who live independent of other living creatures. For example, take cancer ; do you believe God created cancer? I don't believe that at all. Cancer and all diseases are the result of our fallen nature. Death came into the world because of sin, sin is the great enemy of Man and is why we get sick, age and die. Don't misunderstand me though, when a baby is born deformed or handicapped it isn't necessarily because of any specific sin he or his parents committed. It is a result of the general human condition called the sinful nature. That is, if it wasn't caused by some unknown environmental contributor which is also caused by our fallen nature given it exists because of some general social ignorance. Love Canal comes to mind as one such example. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>hahahaha! parasites are animals. many, many animals are parasitic, all of which you claim God created in order to serve us. all species that belong to the animalia kingdom of life are animals, and tapeworms do fall into that kingdom. and to say that God created all animals to serve us, thats saying God created ALL animals to serve us, including parasitic tapeworms. now, it should be a perfectly answerable question - how have tapeworms served you personally? or how could tapeworms serve anyone? the answer is they do not. that is not their purpose, as with every other animal or plant. they are not here to be our servants or for our entertainment. so let me get this straight. if a child is born with no defects or diseases, thats God's miracles, but if a child is born deformed, thats nature and God has nothing to do with it. what, in that instance, God just turns his back and pretends that he didnt notice? no again! a child born normally is nature just as a deformed child is nature. picking and choosing positive things God does and calling the negative things in life " nature's doings " has a name - it's called cherry-picking. also, thank you for cutting the ad hominem attacks and insults. its much appreciated.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Based on this condescending and argumentative reply, your thanks might be a bit premature. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>are you going to respond? you responded to the post, but not the argument. it seems like a re-occurring theme with you.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>To date, there has not been conclusively identified even one direct-line ancestor for modern man.

There's zero conclusive DNA evidence for any of those hominids being a direct line ancestor for modern man. You even had the Neanderthal in there and science has already determined he isn't man's direct line ancestor. And you SWALLOWED THAT WHOLE. Your whole house of cards there is based on morphological simularities and unfounded inference, and we know, for instance, in the case of the Neanderthals that that doesn't cut the mustard. Have you not learned anything here about these issues? Where's the conclusive DNA evidence for just one of your hominids? Show me the conclusive DNA studies? OH YE OF GREAT FAITH AND GREAT DISTORTIONS. YOU SWALLOWED IT WHOLE. Where's the beef, Bennedict?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>go back to the post where you said " abiogenesis is an integral part of evolutionary theory ". then view my reply of links disproving that statement, including the link YOU POSTED in order to try and prove that very statement. tell me, how have ants served you today at all? made you a sandwich? you were the one claiming God put every animal on the earth to serve us, so back that statement up by telling me how ants, cockroaches, fruitflies, earwigs, centipedes, termites and grasshoppers have served you. all of them, because remember, God put all of them on the earth to serve us. did grasshoppers make your shoes? i am the one claiming they are NOT here to serve us, they all make up the intricate biosphere, and we are a part of that family - there are no slaves. you realize that when we sequence the DNA of any animal, they ALL fall into a hierarchy, right? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Prove it by showing me the conclusive DNA evidence that identifies even one hominid as one of man's direct line ancestors.

Who is that bad boy?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>you want me to post the entire genetic sequence? 3 000 000 000 base pairs + ( 14 ) 3 000 000 000 base pairs so you can make a comparison? you want me to post 450 000 000 000 base pairs? its exceedingly difficult to find an entire sequenced genome on the internet for a human, let alone the genome for the entire evolutionary line of ancestors. the information is available at the genetic labs, up until 50 000 to 100 000 years, just not on the internet. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>No, ONE MORE TIME I want you to identify which specific hominid has been shown via conclusive DNA evidence to be man's immediate, direct line ancestor? Get specific, Bennedict. Write down the species ' name for us and show the conclusive DNA evidence. Who is that bad boy? Can't do it, can you? But you are a man of GREAT FAITH that there is such a homonid. OH YE OF GREAT FAITH!!<br><b> S2:5-  </b>you are asking me to give specific names of human ancestors ( which i have already ) and conclusive DNA evidence ( in the form of a genome sequence which is impossible to get on the internet ). the email form is in my other post - ask the professionals. i dont have the information and cant get it from you.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>When you prove that creationism is a myth then you might start to gain some credibility around here. But then again, a large-foreheaded, knuckle-dragging Neanderthal makes a lot of sense as one of your forefathers.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Great argument. Totally convinces me that creationism is more than a myth. And that yours is a religion of love. - retch - <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Love speaks the truth. It doesn't wallow in politically correct fantasies or San Francisco values.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>And yet I see neither love nor truth from you. Just insults and ignorance. By our deeds are we known, eh? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Even Jesus rebuked the devil, and that was a good deed. So I'm in good company. If you're going to run with the big dogs you're going to have to know the entire Bible.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So you think evolutionists are the devil? What makes you think I don't? The fact that I don't treat other human beings the way Jesus treated the devil? Again, your approach to Christian love is not exactly overwhelming.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>not really, mabey you havn't noticed, but the same amount of proof of creation is there....... quite clearly<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Hardly. Most attempts to prove creationism scientifically have been refuted, and there is MUCH more evidence for evolution than creation. Creationism also contradicts itself. This one's been around for ages, but oh well : Cain's wife just appears out of nowhere without explanation. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>tell me 5 facts about " evolution " then i will do my best<br><b> S2:2-  </b>1 ) Humans and apes evolved from a common ancestor. Evidence : microevolution, fossils. 2 ) Species change over time. Evidence : dogs. 3 ) Earth is millions of years old. Evidence : fossils, laws of physics. 4 ) The Sun formed before Earth. Evidence : astronomy. 5 ) Dinosaurs existed. Evidence : fossils. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>fosils, fosils, fosils, fosils..... is that it? wow!! i am now a evoulutionist!!! well, i hope you did some research on creation, because there are ACTUAL facts to prove it. ( not to be rude.. remember, this is my opinion and thats urs )<br><b> S2:3-  </b>And what exactly are those facts?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Thats simply false. You will find little or no molecular biology concepts within the NDS. The ideas did not exist in a well formed mode when NDS was assembled. MOST darwinists have in fact known much of molecular biology - even including such as SJG. And please for the sake of clarity distinguish simple chemical systems from complex ones for us. Is a virus a simple chemical system or is it complex. Is it allopoietic or otherwise?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>** You still don't grasp that ' darwinism ' includes all evolutionary models, including fisherism, in which biological change in morphology and behaviour over time is essentially attributable to accidental changes in clusters of inherited particles. I forget Darwin's word for his theoretical particles. Gemmules, was it? ** What, you don't know the difference between ' simple ' and ' complex '?!? Consult your nearest dictionary. ** It is allopoietic, as it relies entirely upon a living cell and / or random accident for its organization and regeneration. And although I'm no microbiologist, compared to living systems such as cells, viruses seem pretty darn simple to me. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>All of life relies on living cells for its organization and regenerration.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>** No they don't. Living cells organize and regenerate themselves -- they don't ask other cells to do it for them. DUH!! <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Oh really? So where are all these spontaneously generated cells hanging out. Every celll is derived from at least one often two previously existing cells and without those non-self cells they would never come to be. Cells do not create tehmselves any more than hydrogen atoms do!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>** I'm sorry, but I've now lost what little respect I had left for your intellect / integrity. Nothing creates itself out of nothing, ex nihilo, but some things do organize, direct themselves, and serve their own ends. You, as always, are attempting to either dishonestly distort the argument, in this case idiotically or mendaciously corrupting the meaning of ' autopoiesis ', or you understand autopoiesis and and autopoietic systems about as well as a stick of kindling wood might do. Whether you are deliberately and maliciously dishonest, or too intellectually challenged to be able to comprehend anything that doesn't come with pictures, makes no difference to me. You just aren't up to a level where you are worth wasting my time on. And if the baboons who contribute infantile garbage to this forum wish to crow about ' running away ', when I'm simply once more walking away in disgust, then let them. I've been disgusted with them for a long time, and their opinions mean as much to me as do the opinions of a string of cow patties drying in the sun, somewhere. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>My goal is not to gain your respect, its to determine the truth or not of your ideas. Thats nice but has nothing to do with the issue of whether cells rely only upon themselves for their creation - a stand you took and I refute. Nope. Your original statement was clear. I repeat it here : Duh indeed. Living cells do not organize themselves, they depend on previously existing living cells to provide the initial organizational work and that process is genetically governed. Yes I am sure you are above all such concerns as a refutation from little old chemist 99a. However as humble a critic of your ideas as I might be its difficult for you to claim you did not say that which you did say. I presume that debating tactic is something you learned during exam weak at your alma mater? Did it improve your grades?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I guess that could be true, however it is very un-like the God described in the Bible. In fact, the God in the Bible tells his followers NOT to follow blindly ( perhaps the biggest mistake of the Christians in the world today ) but to test and prove. The Bible says " come let us reason together ". Even the creation account in Genesis commands man to master the earth. To master a thing you must understand it. Additionally it is of paramount importantance to any Christian that the Bible backup it's claims. If it cannot be trusted as " the word of God ", but rather as some run-of-the-mill do-good book, then how can the Christian be certain that what they believe in is truth, or a bunch of hocus pocus? Afterall, the VERY SAME book that claims that God created the earth aproximately 6000 years ago also claims that Jesus was the son of God, and you should believe in Him. If one of these claims can be proven incorrect, how can the other be trusted?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Lots of us don't take the Old Testament too seriously as anything more than a set of morality and origins tales dating from the Bronze Age or even earlier. In the light of scientific knowledge, it would be pretty silly to take them as scientific descriptions of prehistoric events, and where they contradict reality, such as in the tale of Noah's Ark, they need to be discounted as anything more than a myth. It's not that myths don't have some heuristic value, but they shouldn't be taken too literally, otherwise we would have to regard Aesop's fables as all literally true. And I don't think even bibliolaters would want to go that far. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Creationists use geneoligical records in the Bible which go from creation to Jesus Christ in about 4004 years. As a matter of historical record, most agree that Jesus was on the earth about 2000 years ago ( perhaps 2007 years ago? ), hence approximately 6000 years. Two points here ; first, that is not what the Bible claims itself to be. It claims itself to be the infallible Word of God. Secondly, the truth is unaffected by popular opinion. With new evidence, or better interpretation of existing evidence comes a change in the popular perception of the truth. Each of us has an opinion on the truth based on our worldview. That worldview effects how we process or interpret the evidence we see. Consider : creationists and evolutionists have the same rocks, the same fossils, the same " evidence ". Both interpret that evidence differently to support their presuppositions in light of their understanding of the world in which they live -- basically filtered through the lens of their worldview. For the creationist, the Bible is their list of presuppositions. For the evolutionist, materialism, naturalism, and uniformitarianism are the underlying presuppositions. Presuppositions are required for interpretation of evidence who's formation was unobserved.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Unfortunately, the worldview of the Creationist is based on mythology ; the world view of the scientist is based on empiricism. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I guess a creationist might ask how many empiricle evolutionists were present at the formation of the universe to observe it, or how many observed the first forms of life, or how many eyewitnesses there were to observe the first stages of evolution. A creationist might wonder how any empiracle process can be based on such little observation. A creationist might point out the number of " missing links ", and wonder how something that is missing and unobserved can be considered empiracle. To the creationist, the evolutionary worldview looks like the mythos, and their creationist view is supported not only by their interpretation of the evidence, but by eyewitness testimony ( the Bible claiming to be the Word of God ). The creationist models have the sea floor lowering over time, while mountainous regions lift, yes. There are deep crevaces in the middle of the pacific ocean. IF the earth were to rip open and enough water the cover the whole earth came out, there would be a void where the water came from. Additionally, there would be a lot of weight on the crust pushing it downward into the void. Actually, most creationists would argue that. see http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v18/i1/oldearth.asp<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I guess a scientist might ask how many Creationists there were as eyewitnesses to god writing the book of Genesis. History leaves its mark in geology and biology. Scientists read and interpret it. All Creationist do is read their bibles, which will teach them nothing about history. A scientist might wonder how Creationists have the cheek to pontificate about science when they know so little biology, geology or even plain physics. A scientist might point out how many mistakes there are in the bible if it is read literally. A scientist would conclude a Creationist can't tell logos from mythos and keeps mixing them up to preserve a discredited literalist interpretation of their bible. Where were the so-called eyewitnesses who saw all this creatin ' goin ' on? Creationist " models " are pure fiction with no science to back them up. They exist solely to explain away the vast errors found in literal interpretations of the bible. They are good for a laugh, but no more.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>And look what it's done to you. That's what I used to think. They only agree because you want them to. It's easy to rationalise using alleged perspective, but there's a plethora of contradictions and anomalies available for perusal on the ' net. Simply because you said the rainbow meant destruction by fire ( which it didn't ). In my previous post I've put it down to semantics. Agreed that it's nothing further from the truth. But I didn't say that. Look at the punctuation. As for the rest of your interpretation of Revelation, I have no problem in essentially agreeing with you to a large extent in that is what the Bible is saying. The slight problem is the veracity of the claims...<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It isn't my job or intent to try to make you believe as I do charlie. In the end we all travel this journey of life alone so believe what you will and good luck with that. I also find it interesting that your avatar represents the bleached white skull of a dead bull. Could that be some prophetic irony? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The last few exchanges are easily summed up, Arch. On the contrary, I learned plenty about the Bible and Christianity. I revelled in it. The real learning comes when you stand outside the box and look in, and analyse dispassionately. No one wants to die if they've got their marbles and health. In those circumstances, very few want to choose when and how to die. I want to live forever. There's a lot to learn. Learning would never cease. A lot of people want that. But not to the point of self-delusion. The real world is here and now. At least you've got a sense of humour. But I find it infinitely more tasteful than the tortured body of a man hanging from the murder weapon.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Are you saving money and investing for retirement Charlie? How about auto and health insurance in case of an accident or illness, do you prepare for that future possibility? Then why isn't preparing for our eternal future just as important as spiritual beings? And more importantly, how is preparing for that time denying or avoiding " the real world in the here and now "? You make no sense for one who claims to have studied the truth. I haven't noticed any avatars on this site of Jesus hanging on the Cross. Can you point it out please? Mine represents the " Lion of Judah " who as you can plainly see is very much alive and well, and beautiful too. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It makes no sense to you, Arch, because you think you have found The Truth. Nothing outside of that will influence you. The Truth is a prison for the mind. Yes, I studied The Truth for years. As ultimately there wasn't a shred of evidence for it, apart from wishful thinking, getting out was supreme sense. Did I infer that? I see crucifixes adorning necks every day. Look at me ; I'm a Christian. Or else it's a hypocritical sham. Every day I see roadside crucifixes - sometimes up to 4 m high - and shrines. The reference wasn't directed at you, Arch, but the Christian in general and their use of sick imagery.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I don't think I know the truth charlie, I know it. The Holy Spirit of God which indwells me assures me of my eternal standing as His child. You are perfect evidence of the difference between studying The Truth and Knowing It. Had you truly possessed the Holy Spirit and knew the Lord, you wouldn't be rejecting Him as foolishness now. Yes you did infer it since my original statement was referring to avatars and had nothing to do with Crosses in general. You should have been more clear about generic crosses you see in your everyday travels. Also, it's worth pointing out that the Cross isn't a symbol of death as you see it but is a symbol of resurrection and eternal life. I'm really starting to doubt you ever went to any type of Bible College as you have no understanding about what is even believed. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>@ Archangel - I've tried to be polite and at least try and educate you, but in this I have singularly failed. This is self-opinionated and staggering arrogance of the first order, and wouldn't be uttered by a true Christian who knew the Bible. Did you never read Matt. 24:13? He that endures to the end is the one that will be saved. You've already decided that you've got eternal standing before the end. Secondly, whilst tough debate is not for the squeamish and those of delicate sensibilities, you regularly pen spiteful comments in your replies ( as evidenced to other posters in this thread. ) That is not in the true spirit of debate either, even allowing some leeway. By your example it is difficult to conclude that you are an ambassador for Christ ( 2 Cor. 5 : 20 ) and that a belief in God is worth pursuing. You have all the appearances of an internet troll.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Some more thoughs on darkness ( as in what you get at night ) : It is an effect that humans percieve because of the sensitivity of our visual senses. It occurs because of a lack / abscence of light. So isn't light / dark just like hot and cold? Both dark and cold occur when there is a lack of something ( ambient light, thermal energy ). Both are a subjective human perception resulting from the sensitivity of our sensory systems. Both ambient light and heat can be objectively measured, but not in a way that directly equates to human perception. We can say wow, its cold today and measure the ambient temperature to find it is 2 degrees celsius. We can then say when the ambient temperature is 2 degrees celsius its cold. Likewise we can measure the Light Value of a subject. We might say its dark at the moment and the LV is - 14. We could when there is a LV of - 14 a person would percieve darkness. All this non-material stuff is like playing with smoke and mirrors and making confusion over something we can describe and quantify, certainly in terms of our own perceptions.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So you describe darkness by a negative ; lack of light. Light is material, and can be measured, if you take all that light-material away you are left with an area that is material-less, or non-material. It is darkness. It is real in so far as it exists ; affecting animals, plants etc. It is non-material in that it can not be measured ; because there isn't any ' materail ' there to measure ; despite Mach's unsupported claim to the contrary. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not a negative but an absence off, like with my comparison with hot / cold. The " negative " is a product of our perception - if I take my same example about the light and apply the same conditions to a cat, it does not perceive darkness as we do due to the sensitivity of its senses ( in this case because of the high proportion of rods to cones in the retinas of its eyes ). Why do you say it cannot be measured? we measure the available light and that gives us an understanding of how light / dark it is. We could say zero light would equal absolute darkness ( as in absolute zero, 0 K is in the Kelvin temperature scale ). That is our measure of darkness. Darkness is no more immaterial to light than the zero energy state absolute zero is to heat.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Show me the test to measure darkness. What is the speed of dark? Your belief is un-scientific, as far as I know science can only test for what ' is ' ; as in material. I could be wrong, but no one has yet shown me a science ' test ' for something that doesn't exist in material. It can test for light ; heat ; sound ; etc. Thus it can give properties of each ; a speed of sound ; a speed of light. There is no speed of cold, of silence, of darkness. A ' measure for darkness ' is not gained by measuring light. Measuring light is measuring light. If you argue that darkness is material, show me what it is made of. If you argue that darkness is non-material, then you can't suggest science can measure it. This is after-all a foundation of the claim of Mach et al ; that science can know everything there ' is '. It must be shown how science measures ' it ', or he and others have to face the fact that althought ' it ' is... it can't be measured by science. However, I am unsure if this relates to dark matter ; which has not been observed ; only its affects on matter have been observed. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Perception, perception, perception! we can quanitatively test for the light and the heat, that is all that is actually " there ". The cold and darkness are only concepts of description that our minds use to desribe the lack of heat and light. We could discard dark and cold completely and describe everything in terms of warmth and light.......... it just wouldn't be as articulate for describing the world we perceive. What is darkness made of? it is all the material world around us. We just don't always perceive it because of the presense of light. Forget dark matter..... thats another issue of perception ( ie. the capabilities of our current sensing equipment ).<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are the one who said it was nothing but a concept post #78 Thanks, but it doesn't help your argument... whatever that happens to be. So, you're saying I should do research to support some position you have, whatever that position is at the moment? It is rathe pointless, ' light ' is material. Darkness is not. Then show me the facts. Funny debate! So, you're opinion is not just an opinion, but based on facts which are ' somewhere ' on Google. This is convincing stuff.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>There exactly the same. Fishnever fossilize unledd buried quickly in a catastrophic watery event so there is absolutly no reason to believe the Coelacanth is at all different that an ancient one. Except of course atheism needs evolution. Science says it is the same animal. It's called observation. The skeletons are identical.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Please view this page : http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/c...nth_evolution/ Then kindly explain which of the three extinct species ( A, B and C near the bottom of the page ) are in your opinion " identical " to the modern species ( the top picture ). Not quite. When you start to learn something about evolution you will learn why you are not quite right here. You ought right that even a XXXXX should be able to get it. Sadly you are living proof that you are wrong though. Pay attention please. We are talkign about life here, not buildings. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You insult my intelligence by refering me to an internet infidels site. What possible reason does an atheist have to tell the truth? The fact that other lobe fin-finshed once existed does not change the fact that the what you call the modern version is represented in the fossils exactly. It only proves the limits of your gullibility. I know I am not quite right arguing with a religious fanatic like yourself. Please rephrase this. So you are saying that human life, or any life for that matter is capable of self assembly but buildings are not? Why is that? Are buildings more complex? Please explain the process of spontaneous generation and pre-biotic natural selection that are necessary for one to be an atheist and believe in self assembly?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I know I'm sorry. Never again will I insult you by assuming you have any intelligence. Oh dear. You really are a head case aren't you? Stop talking to yourself please and address me when replying to me. Thank you. Yes. We have yet to develop buildings capable of self-assembly. We will probably get there one day though. See http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4538547.stm for example for early efforts at creating robots that can self assemble and build copies of each other. We have a long way to go of course, and no doubt evloutionary design methods will need to be used to achieve more complex designs, but we no doubt will get there. No, it is because buildings are not at all complex and are woefully incapable of self assembly. Neither are necessary. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If you assumed to be able to tell you would be insulting my intelligence. Please don't call me dear. Okay I will whistle through your head when I need your attention. Is there an echo when you think? Human beings build robots! If the robot is programmed to build a car does that mean the car evolved? You are making a better case for a Supernatural Creator with that argument than one for spontaneous generation. Did the robots evolve over millions of years? So the more complex it is the more likely it was an unplanned accident? Brilliant deduction!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Not yet. Where does unplanned accidents come into it? You asked about self assembly. The more complex, the more likely it can self assemble ( within reason - cells are very good at self assembly, likewise so are sponges. Humans are less good at it though ).<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It does unless you believe IT did it.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>what the hell are you talking about? How does that even relate to creation? I don't know. Ah. hehehhe http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB630.html :) What are you talking about? Modern birds are vastly different then dinosaurs. While they do share a considerable amount of anatomical features, it is a sheer idioctic statement to say that punctuated equilibrium proves that. Not to mention that it also shows sheer ignorance of evolution. Notice how you refuse to refute it. Why is it that creationists cannot even hit one point talk origins describes? Pathetic. http://www.cnr.berkeley.edu/~roderick/publications.htm You do know what talkorigins is right? It's a website of peer reviewed refuations of creationists lies. merely because you are too weak to deal with it doesn ; t mean it is wrong. Not to mention that politics is irrevelant. That's the fradulent behavior of ad-homeni. EVEN IF IT WAS, doesn't mena it is wrong. how does it feel to be a fraudlent debator? :) Why? Fallacy : exclusion of the middle. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>[ quote ] Peer review and talkorigins? How does it feel to live on another planet? You should learn to think on your own. Publishing a document on talk origins does not constitute peer anything.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I gave you another peer reviewed besides talkorgins. You completely failed to address that one as well. I see your challenges are empty as when they are met, you cannot fulfil your end. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>? Send it again.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You didn ; t evne read my post. It's there. GO LOOK. Sheer laziness, another sign of a fradulent creationists.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>monkeys are very different from people. Please be serious.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>How different? Are monkeys more different or less diferent than Australopithecus afarensis? How different are people from Homo habilis? Is the degree of difference between humans and Homo habilis the same degree of difference between humans and Homo erectus, or Homo neanderthalensis? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>If you cannot tell the difference between a man and a monkey go back to school. The tail should be a hint, the toe seperation the knees, opposing thumbs, backbones, teeth, intelligence etc. Hang out at your local zoo for more information. Australopithecus afarensis is very similar to the pygmy chimpanzee Homo Habilis is a junkbin skeleton, one of Leakey's frauds. Scientist dismiss it only atheist websites defend it. It's a bad joke. Homo erectus is within the range of modern man as well. Neanderthals are within the range of modern humans, I really don't have time for this.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Really? You'll have to scroll down a bit, but here's the gist of it : I'm also interested in what you have to say about the recently discovered Homo floresiensis. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Jakarta Post ( JP ) ran an article on 8 November 2004 titled    RI scientists refute Flores Man finding.    ( RI = Republic of Indonesia. ) The article reports Dr. Teuku Jacob, a paleoanthropology professor from Gadjah Mada University, as saying :    The skeleton is not a new species as claimed by these scientists, but simply a fossil of a modern human, Homo sapiens, that lived about 1,300 to 1,800 years ago.    The bones were unfossilized and wet. National Geographic is famous for it's Piltdown Bird fraud. To quote them as a scientific source is a joke. It is not a science magazine. If you were alive back then you would have believed in Nebraska Man and Piltdown Man. Think about that! Then look at this pick and say to yourself, Long ago and far far away. This time it is probably true for a change. P.S. Please take your missing link argument to the missing link post. It is boring me to death.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>If you're going to make assertions, please provide links. Show me where I can read more about this Dr. Teuku Jacob, because it seems he can't even get the dates right ( Homo floresiensis lived 13,000 years ago, not 1300 ). And again, I ask : If these are just humans with microcephaly, where are the normal humans that should have lived among them? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You will have to ask the Jakarta Post about that but it defies credibility that wet bones could be that old let alone the 38,000 that are claimed. http://www.thejakartapost.com/yester...d=20041106.A05 Again if you want to argue the moronic missing link theory go to that post. Flores is an ISLAND Maybe they ate their enemies I don't know. That question, where are the other humans is breathtakingly stupid. Where were the other species when punctuated equilibrium occured? Why didn't Superman do more to protect our coast from u-boats? Please use your brain.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I didn't think you'd be able to answer the question. And I'll take it from you silence on Homo erectus that you now concede it is in fact a different species.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>One thing I think I have gleaned so far from this discussion is that natural selection involves matingand preying. In the case of snake head mimicry, the carnivorous animals select ( for dinner ) the prey that look least like a snake, leaving the snake-like to select similarly marked mates and replicate themselves with more ( quantity wise ) snake-like offspring. A subsequent random mutation produces a more snake-like appearance that enables the mutants to survive the selection-for-dinner process and proceed to the selection-for-mating process. It does seem plausible that similarly marked males and females would naturally select each other and reject others that do not have similar markings. Is this ^^^^^^^^^ correct?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yeah, that's about right, mostly. Natural selection can involove mating and preying, but that's not the only mechanism. Anything that gives you an edge over your fellows can be used for selection. Ability to not be eaten, ability to catch prey, ability to open nuts, stamina, large size, small size, bright colors, camoflage, bad taste, scary appearance. Any of these might make you live longer and thus be selected for, depending on specific circumstance. As for how worms select mates, I don't know the details, but I wouldn't assume that coloration necessarily plays an important role. They may well identify prosepective mates by pheremones ; similar coloration could be utterly irrelevant. You'd have to answer that question on a species by species basis, and I don't know the answer for this species. Scratch that, I do know. The worms don't mate, the butterflies do. So the coloration of the worm is irrelevant for mating in this case. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Would not the coloration of the worm ( caterpillar ) determine the coloration of the butterfly thus causing similarly marked caterpillars to metamorphose into similarly marked butterflies? It seems that the trait ( snake-head-shaped tail ) on the caterpillar must be passed through each generation regardless of whether the butterfly has any resemblance to a snake.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The whole genome would get passed on, yes. But totally different genes could, and almost certainly do, govern the color of the butterfly as opposed to the color of the caterpillar. So the snake-like coloration would have no effect on mating habits, aside from the fact that caterpillars with that coloration are more likely to live long enough to mate at all. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>That was the point. The selection of something other than the snake-like caterpillar as a food item is partially responsible for the mating opportunity of the surviving butterfly... the natural selection here being attributed to the carnivore, not the survivor.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I was responding to your statement " It does seem plausible that similarly marked males and females would naturally select each other and reject others that do not have similar markings ". The coloration of the caterpillars would not work that way, since it's not the caterpillars that mate. But otherwise you have it right. Edit : Or mostly so. I'm getting a little nitpicky here, but you wouldn't say that " natural selection " is be attributed to the carnivore, that's not how the term is used. The process is natural selection, it's acting on the caterpillar, and the agent in this case is predation. Not a big deal, it just seems that you're getting this stuff well enough that you should be using the terms correctly. Precision makes the discussion easier, after all.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Accipter is an agnostic not an atheist. All the rest is irrelevant and a chance for you to be pedantic. p<br><b> S2:1-  </b>No, someone who is an agnostic and is not an atheist is an agnostic theist - and Accipter certainly isn't one of those. An athiest is not just ' someone who believes in no God '. It broadly means ' someone who does not believe in God ' - the people with faith in God's absence are just a subset of all those who don't have faith in His presence. Like I said, ( a ) theism is a dichotomy. You either believe in a God, or you don't - you can be a skeptic, but you still have to lie on one side or other of that dividing line. Your attempt to label this as ' pedantic ' is ironic, coming from someone who's currently trying to tell me what my beliefs ( or lack thereof ) are. ( Oh - and who just took the time to look up and post the definition of ' pedantic '. ) Agnostic atheism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>An Athiest is someone who denies the existence of God.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Atheism is anything that has no belief in God. Someone who denies God fit's into that category, yes.... your point? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>My point is that Accipter is not an atheist. Please try to keep up!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Any my point is that, since Accipter has no belief in God, he is. Denial of God is sometimes a feature of atheism, but it is not necessary. I'm way ahead of you. The bolded part is entirely false. Insisting otherwise may not be pedantic, but it definitely indicates that you've been using the wrong terminology for years now and are reluctant to change. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>No, you are still trailing way behind.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>... it only looks that way to you because we're going in circles. You have stated your opinion. I have cited my definition - repeatedly.

You wasnt aware of that post from Accipter was you? I never stated an opinion, I provided definitions to prove that Accipiter was not what he said he was.. and succeeded<br><b> S2:5-  </b>The opinion you've implied is that the definition you linked to is the only one for atheism that applies. The opinion you've stated is that an agnostic is someone who ' denies true atheism '. Both of these opinions conflict with my citations. Both of these opinions are incorrect. I don't disagree with your definitions - just your citations. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I think Accipter cant call himself an atheist Where have I implied an agnostic is someone who denies true atheism. I have made very simple and accurate definitions and reached a conclusion using those definitions.. the rest is in your head<br><b> S2:6-  </b>The exact phrase you used was ' does not profess true atheism ' - post #526. It is false because it implies that ' true atheism ' is different from what it is. As I showed before - ' denial of god ' is just one subset of non-believers, all of whom are ' true atheists '. Accipter can call himself an atheist for the same reason that I can - we have no belief in God. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>An Athiest is someone who denies the existence of God. Accipiter does not rule out the existence of God therefore he cannot deny Gods existence. Ten out of ten for being obtuse<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It is beyond sad that evolutionists here can't stay on topic and produce even one straight answer, but instead have to resort to changing the subject, insults and fallacies.

There you have it, obvious _ child cannot post without resorting to massive dishonesty, personal attacks, changing the subject or all three.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>you're on the right track ; the problem with evolution is that it has no verifiable creator -- the fact is, mutations ( which supposedly add new raw material for selection ) have never shown to add any new structure or even a new part to any existing structure. It's a sad fact for evos.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>How many times have you spammed that argument super? 10? 15? 20 times?

Fallacies are a creationist's best friend. You claimed : " have never shown to add any new structure or even a new part to any existing structure. " Now you are changing your argument away from structure as new proteins and especially enzymes ( which are proteins ) don't count. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>first of all, the claim is that random changes in molecules do not produce bodiliy structures. Proteins are molecules and are thus not what I was referring to. Second, there are no new enzymes or new proteins produced by any mutations... and not only that but none of those mutations have been shown to be random. So for all the billions of bodily structures in the world, ToE cannot account for even ONE of them.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Since when was evolution defined by the presence of new body parts? Except that proteins are in fact structures and play a huge role in organisms. To deny them as relevant is to essentially say that your body isn't important. Without proteins and their functions, life cannot exist. Incorrect. I provided two links showing that claim you regularly spammed as false. How many times have you been refuted on that? 10? 15? 20? 100? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>so of all the animal kingdom, the evidence that mutations can create new sturcutures has been narrowed down to two proteins. I deny that these were caused by mutations... show me the reference.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Read the link. Seriously, are you STILL against reading links? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>There are no links! Documentation of mutations producing new features includes the following : the ability of a bacterium to digest nylon ( Negoro et al. 1994 ; Thomas n.d. ; Thwaites 1985 ) ; adaptation in yeast to a low-phosphate environment ( Francis and Hansche 1972 ; 1973 ; Hansche 1975 ) ; the ability of E. coli to hydrolyze galactosylarabinose ( Hall 1981 ; Hall and Zuzel 1980 ) ; evolution of multicellularity in a unicellular green alga ( Boraas 1983 ; Boraas et al. 1998 ) ; modification of E. coli's fucose pathway to metabolize propanediol ( Lin and Wu 1984 ) ; evolution in Klebsiella bacteria of a new metabolic pathway for metabolizing 5 - carbon sugars ( Hartley 1984 ) ; The nylon bug is actually 140 mutations ( how could those arise randomly? ) and uses a pre-existing enzyme.... nothing new.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Uh, genetic engineering would be deliberate changes of genetics towards a specific goal. None of those had any goal. All they were was experiments to see what would happen if something got added. Please look up engineering. And look at the links at the bottom of the page. They are the blue things. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>here's an example -- show me the mutation -- where is it? evolution of multicellularity in a unicellular green alga ( Boraas 1983 ; Boraas et al. 1998 ) ;<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Evolution of biological complexity?

I'll admit they are not specific to that example, but you are fallaciously trying to argue that one represents the whole. The links provided discuss how mutations create new features. That is the overarching issue here. Stop using fallacies when you can't argue your primary points.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>the eye would have formed under positive selection pressure. meaning, no specific event needs to take place, per say. what i mean by positive selection pressure is that alleles increase a trait which succeeds instead of alleles decreasing and getting rid of negative traits, leaving only positive traits. the way the eye formed was probably not with negative pressure, seeing as with the progressions of the eye, animals will avoid predators instead of the negative alleles being eaten. genetic drift means a general change in the pattern and prevalence of a given interval in a species undergoing a genetic change. the name implies not a stillness but a movement from one point to another. and with the genetic drift formulas, we can predict the outcome of an interval based on known variations and knowing what they do. which is exactly what you proposed with guided mutation.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The specific events of the mutations would have to take place and selection events would have to follow. That is apparent. I have never heard of genetic drift being associated with any selection what so ever. You have said you read darwin's black box the more I read your posts the more I think you don't know what IC is. Can you explain what you think it is in terms of selection pressure? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>it was quite a long time ago when i read the book, ive forgotten most of it, and like you said it was quite confusing to begin with so im not sure i understood it when i read it. but ive researched a number of creationist arguments and the evolutionist responses, especially the dover trial. by your definition of IC ( something that could not have come about by a process ), it can not be applied to selection pressure, since selection pressure involved a number of evolutionary processes.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well that is one of the definitions but that statement is also equivalent to that which cannot have positive selection pressure until it exists. It if fortunate that I do not agree with your attitude that one must read every possible article or book on a subject or else I would declare you to ignorant to discuss IC :p <br><b>S1:3-  </b>i didnt claim that you must read every book on evolution in order to discuss it, i said you have to have an understanding of the evolutionary process and you get that through reading some of the basic evolutionary literature - it appears to me that you have less than satisfactory understanding of the evolutionary process, seeing as you asked me to provide a link between intermediate forms and the evolutionary process when the answer is very obvious and direct to a person with basic understanding of evolutionary theory. you claim to be neither a creationist nor an evolutionist, but youve read at least two creationist books that i know of, probably more, and zero books on evolution, yet you claim to have a good understanding of both, and an unbiased opinion on both. somehow i doubt that.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are right that is an exaggeration of what you said. I do have an understanding of both the proposed and actual evolutionary process and from my perspective it is greater than average. I disagree, I am sure if you provided the point as a formal argument I would be able to show you what I mean. By your definition Behe is a creationist, and so are his books for they conclude ID. IC didn't need a book for it's own definition and neither does evolution. I have speculated before and asked you to correct me if I was wrong but I think The Origin of Species contains mostly chapters on evidence and ties them together with the theory briefly perhaps in two pages? Yes You may doubt but I cannot see that doubt as relevant. It's a boolean measurement, if you mean how does one go about measuring IC's implications to random chance I would say the genetic differential should be that meter. Yes, that was the point of the guided mutation formula / test. It's not a scientific theory it's an argument, you evaluate arguments you don't study them like a field of knowledge.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>All your effort wasted because you cannot comprehend that you do not NEED to ' believe ' in a fact. You do not seem to understand this simple concept and that is why you are seeing contradictions that are not there<br><b> S2:1-  </b>NEED for what? I proved the contradiction, as I said it is very rare for terms of online arguments to be so simple as to practicaly allow for that and almost as unlikley that a poster would let a formal fallacy past them. So enjoy, it could be months till another one :) <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You proved you didnt understand the point in the first place and confirmed it in your last post. It glares out to me but you seem to be blind to it. You invented your own formal fallacy to prove. Unfortunately I doubt whether it will be months before you make the same mistake, probably the next post<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I am translating this to ' no comment but still need to respond to save face '. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You declared you successfully disproved a point that you did not understand in the first place. You have a lot of face to save :)<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I have noticed you are happy with simple contradiction, so why don't you imagine a copy of me repeatedly telling you that you're wrong ok? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teMlv3ripSM <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You never did have one :)<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Irreducible complexity is not an obstruction to ID for the simple reason that any being with such command of the naturalistic processes IS by definition " several orders of magnitude " more complex, likely an infinite order of magnitudes, than its supposed designs. Why is it necessary to have to " come from somewhere ", for if it came from ' somewhere ', then can it not follow that it must have been created by another even higher being, and thus the question logically follows through infinity. Thus using Occams Razor here, it appears that the simplest answer is that the Intelligent Designer always existed.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>No the simplest answer is no designer. You missed one regression. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>If the simplest thing is no designer, then you are back to a paradox in that you have life, but no scientific explanation of life except conjectures and hypothesises. The necessity of ' high school biology ' teaching conjecture is that evolutionists are backed up against the wall with their pants down, sic, when they arrive at OOI. To them, this is completely unacceptable, much like AGW ' scientists ' being stymied by the recent 10 year cooling period, cannot explain it, and find it totally unacceptable. The ' simplest thing ' is just to admit you don't know.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Your error here is to say that no scientific explanation at this moment in time means no scientific explanation ever. I don't get your point. Who is saying anything other than " We don't know "? As far as I'm aware nobody ' knows ' exactly how life originated. But what we do know is adding extraneous entities ( such as supernatural beings ) does not help our understanding one iota. When a scientist does not know something they are not ' backed up against the wall '. That is the challenge every scientist revels in. Trying to understand what is yet unknown is the point of science. Getting to a point where there are questions we can't answer yet ( such as the mechanism for the origin of life ) is what keeps scientist doing research and hard work to answer those questions. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No ' error ' as that is not what I said. Where did I say this? Of course, that is ' science. ' Good hunting, and good luck.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>If your meaning was not that no current explanation means no scientific explanation ever, I apologise. What was your meaning with this sentence? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>That scientists are at a quandary until they can show a viable position as to how inanimate matter suddenly became living matter. If you read my qoute, it states that that is where scientists are Now, does not suggest something cannot change at some point in the future.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What you seem to be missing in this argument is that more complex molecules do form from simpler ones by chance and chance alone. You throw a bunch of organic molecules in, apply some energy and out pops something more complex than anything that was put in. Over the surface of an entire planet, this could be reasonably speculated to happen millions of times a second. Over the course of millions of years, this can happen billions and billions of times. Many self replicating molecules could have popped up during this time. The next hurdle is finding one that is stout enough to survive UV light, heat. etc. Evidence suggest that as soon as the Earth cooled enough for organic molecules to remain stable, life emerged. I may be confused here, but are you suggesting that because there was no line leading up to the first replicating molecule that evolution could not have taken over since there was no process already in place? My understanding is that once you have a surviving population of anything that are all able to pass on information to subsequent populations in an imperfect manner, evolution is inevitable.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So you're saying that a dog could have evolved from a cat, right? Or a rabit or a beaver ; I mean, who knows what will pop out based on those organic molecules and just the right amount of energy. Of course you can't prove any of this, I should just take your word for it though cuz you really really believe it, right? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Actually I was talking about self replicating molecules and the idea that life is supposedly IC. I didn't expect you to understand any of it.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But you said in the post right above that more complex molecules do form from simpler ones given enough energy. I assumed you were referring to more complex life forms evolving from simpler ones since it is evolution we are discussing here, no? This just seems to be more of the slippery definitions which always change and never remain consistent enough to actually pin down. You apologists for evolution can't defend your religion to save your lives, can you. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Actually, like I said, I didn't expect you to get it. I was talking about more complex molecules forming from simpler molecules when energy is applied, just like I said. I never said more complex lifeforms. Again, make sure you know what you are talking about before you attempt to refute someone's claim.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>More arrogance and condescension from the guy who can't phrase his post clearly enough to be understood by someone he considers to be a novice. BTW, the discussion is about evolution of the species, not molecules. Unless you're going to come back and say that one leads to the other in which case your claim that I didn't get it is proven to be completely bogus as usual. In any event, you prove how slippery your ideology is as you attempt to not get proven wrong by me. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Actually, one does lead to the other. That is the relevance. Why can't you just say that you misunderstood the context of the statement instead of now saying it doesn't belong in this discussion?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I've outlined perfectly clear why the evolution of new body parts should be directly observed, and no evolutionists have even come close to addressing the real issue.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>While an organism developing a new limb would be evidence towards Evolution, it is not the only evidence of Evolution. Your meiopic focus on an organism developing a new limb is flawed because such an observation is not required to prove ToE is a valid model, and therefore its absence does not disprove ToE as a valid model. Developing a new limb is only one of many possible results of genetic variance. Incidentally since you mentioned speciation, here is a link to a fairly extensive list of examples where speciation ( the creation of a new species ) has been observed. Examples of speciation. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I am not disputing the fact that genes change over time. That's not what the creation v evolution debate is all about. I'm disputing the allegation that all life evolved from a common ancestor. Your link only points to examples where population changed slightly but enough so that evolutionists can dub it a new species. There were never any new body parts OR new functions evolved in a population in which it was absent.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Funny, because the title of this thread ( which you started ) is " There is absolutely no convincing evidence of the theory of evolution ". In this thread, you also directly attack ToE and once again identify it by name. Perhaps you should clarify your threads, then and start discussing the implication of ToE that we all have common ancestry, rather than ToE as a whole. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>What's there to clarify? The theory of evolution states that all life has a common ancestor.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>ToE is a scientific model. That life has a common ancestor is only one implication. I'm sorry you don't see the difference.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>So according to you, evolution admits it doesn't know? Funny, as far back when I was in grade school, back in the early 70's, evolution was taught as a FACT which has been the case ever since. The ' magical causation ' was not ' introduced ' as it was around long before ' scientists ' were little more than astrologers.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You are indeed showing a lack of education.. evolution IS a fact. It has been demonstrated that there is decent with modification, and that this can cause new species to arise. That is the fact of evolution. The Theory of evolution are models of why it happens, and how it happened in the past. Just like gravity. If you hold a concrete block over your foot, and let go, it will hurt your foot. That is a fact of gravity. The THEORY of Gravity is a model that tries to explain WHY and HOW it happens. So sorry, but you are so wrong that ' close ' is meaningless in molecular biology. ERV's are evidence that you are quite incorrect in this claim Retroviral DNA insertions, and the simularity between the ERV's and Chimps prove your claim is incorrect. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Are you still in grade school? Evolution has an ELEBORATE model, but nowhere on it do I see where dogs are becoming cats or horses becoming cows, etc, sic. FACT and CLOSE are RELATIVE do you presume that ' close ' means anything on a sub-atomic scale so take your schoolboy tactics elsewhere.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well, when it comes to biology, you certainly have a grade school education, because the TOE says nothing about dogs becoming cats, or horses becoming cows.

Anyway Duo _ Maxwell this isn't only creationist debaters, there are many more who do the same thing with different debates. you also forgot 7. Make random accusations of logical fallacies when they have no idea what they even mean. Example : You said that my spelling is wrong, that's the biggest strawman I've ever heard 8. Correct spelling mistakes and convienantly not answer the question. Example : " What do you thinkk of carbon dating? " " you spelled think wrong ". If you want to correct spelling, fine but answer the question as well. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>If I am to believe in something even if it's scientific, I should be able to challenge the belief's of the person who's pushing it. If they don't believe in what they're selling, why should I. You better read it again dude. I know and I would say they are wrong also. I may be overly enthusiastic, but I do believe people can disagree and still be civil. I don't have the right to make accusations about logical fallacies and how do you know I don't know what they mean. Explain. I don't remember correcting your spelling, please refresh my memory. There was nothing wrong with my answer. I did the correction after being insulted, double-standard huh. I am not entitled to my own opinion if it doesn't agree with yours. I expected alot more from you, you've let me down. Your obviously only looking at one side of the argument.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So why should you care about their non-scientific beliefs in a debate on science? Most people who believe in evolution do so because of science, so their non-scientific beliefs are irrelevant. I agree, this wasn't targeted specifically at you, which was why I said there were other people who do these things besides creationists. Again, this wasn't just about you and me. I do think you corrected someone's spelling and if you didn't it was another creationist. What does spelling have to do with your own opinion? Again this isn't just about you although I think you did resort to correcting someone's spelling and just didn't answer the question. This has nothing to do with being entitled to your own opinion. It is equally bad for anyone to resort to personal attacks on either side of the debate. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If a scientist doesn't believe his test results are accurate, and expects me to place my life savings on his project would that not be pretty stupid. I did answer the question, before I injected anything about spelling. I agree.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Ah, but you said non-scientific beliefs. That would be like asking about your non-religious beliefs as a challenge to why you belief in God. It wouldn't make sense. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>If a scientist doesn't trust his own experiment's, why should everyone else. No, it's not quite the same. Experiments are suppose to be falsible, where according to science christianity isn't.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Read my post to zachvac.

Pandion you started mocking me in the last paragraph of your first post, way before I copted an attitude. Had you not mocked me I wouldn't have copted an attitude at all and would have gladly explained my dilemma. You mocked me just after you asked why I couldn't present my edvidence. Then you expect me to be all gleeful and respectful. You are not innocent in this, so don't claim to be.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>If you think Christianity is souind, you are in some serious need of psychiatric help. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Maybe in your opinion, but I really don't count your's.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It's not an opinion. It's a fact. You have to be mentally disturbed on some level to take any of that metaphysical nonsense seriously. THere is as much evidence for creationism and God as there is for the easterbunny. After all, both Jesus and the easterbunny are mentioned in storybooks, and the reading level required of both of them are about on the same level. Creationists never have a sense of humor. God must think it's a sin. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It is not a fact. HaHaHAHAROFL<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It is a fact. In fact, it's such a fact, it was mentioned by neurologists as such! <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Where's the evidence!!!!!<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Completely untrue. It is widely acknowledged because it explains the geology of the Earth. Evolution has nothing to do with it. Untrue. It has been done. You don't like the result, because it contradicts a fairy tale you hold to be true, but that is irrelevent. The Earth has been aged scientifically and accurately and it is very old.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What tool did they use to determine the age of the earth?. Is it the same tool they used to date a living shellfish and find it to be thousands of yrs old... " The earth has been scientifically and accurately and its very old ". This sounds like another absolute to me, when i believe from what the evolutionists are saying that there can not be any absolutes? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>See the thing is Stormboy, this sort of comment from you reafirms my view that you are stupid and believe the lies and propoganda that creation " experts " spout. For example, if someone informed you that screwdrivers where a useless tool because they had tried to screw a lightbulb into its socket with one and broke the bulb, would you : ( a ) accept that the screwdriver was a useless tool? ( b ) conclude that the person was more than a little deranged? So when someone uses a tool that is known to not work on aquatic samples, for very well understood reasons, to test an aquatic sample do you blame the tool and not the imbecile wielding it?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>How can you come to the conclusion that i am stupid from that, misinformed maybe, but stupid?. You might want to watch how easily you throw your insults around champ... One day it just may end up in the wrong direction and you may end up in a very unpleasant posi and when that day comes, who is going to be feeling stupid? By the way i choose b. It takes a man with their head on their shoulders to be able to recieve correction. Thankyou I would still like to look more into how they actually date the earth <br><b>S1:3-  </b>My apologies. I accept that I was being unnecessarily rude there.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Apology accepted!<br><b>S1:1-  </b>canadianman 77 : oddly you keep arguing that God can be proven, but you haven't seemd to be able to do so<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Nothing can be proven beyond a doubt. And I cant prove that god exists, but you cant prove he doesnt, so I say he does exist and thats all there is to it. Prove to me he doesnt exist... Im waiting. Well? Were is your undeniable proof that he doesnt exist? Really I would like to see this proof that you base your logical conclusion that there is no way he exists on. Honestly, I'd really like to see it, or did your dog eat your report this morning? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Good. You are learning. But you are claiming God as proof for other issues. As such, you have a problem with your fundemental argument as it rests upon something as yet unproven. You seem to have a very selective memory. I never said it does not exist. As such, the rest of your argument is quite worthless as it accuses me of something I never said. I do recall however, saying that God cannot be proven or disproven many, many time here. In the future, it would help you to look that up before making yourself out to be a fool,.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You just said that my statement " nothing can be proven beyond a doubt " was true, and then accuse me of arguing my point upon something that is unproven... And I'm making myself look like a fool? Idiot. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Alright... Ah, but you are claiming such as proof that your argument is true. If we apply your logic even further, you cannot even make such claims. Of course you are. You are claiming that the existance of God is true, and then use that to allege something else is true. That doesn't fly. Thank you for admitting you are a idiot. Saves me the trouble I'm waiting for you to prove when I said God doesn't exist<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I just assumed that you dont believe in god, seeing as how you take such strong offense to the fact that I believe he does exist. Or do you believe that he does exist and you have a hidden agenda? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well, you assumed wrong. I take offense to you claiming something without proving it. While nothing can be proven beyond a doubt, you cannot live your life as a true skeptic. As such, as you obviously do not understand that bit of philosophy, the reasoning is beyond you.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What I meant was that someday I hope that scientific evidence will support a strong argument that god exists. One that every objective scientist will agree with.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Well, as you have already been informed : To continue making such statements about scientific proof of god only makes your scientific illiteracy more obvious. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Science by definition wont support a strong argument that god exists if the proper evidence is presented? Are you saying that scientific procedures dismiss any possibility of a god existing? Sounds like you're the scientifically illiterate one to me.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Somehow I knew that you wouldn't be able to understand. God is, by definition, supernatural. That means that He is beyond nature. Science is, by definition, naturalistic. That means that it lacks the tools to examine anything that is supernatural. Not only are you a scientific illiterate, you also seem to be totally ignorant of theology. I think that maybe your religion is based on superstition rather than theology, just as your science is based on ignorance. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Science has explained many things that were previously considered supernatural. The northern lights, earthquakes, the stars in the sky at one time were thought to be supernatural. There goes your theory. What would someone from ancient times say if you told them that there body was made up of trillions of little things that resembled solar systems. That would just be silly. Mayabe even a supernatural dream?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You still are using a mythology and superstition based theology. Of course there are things that science has explained that were once thought to have been the work of your god. Turns out, they weren't supernatural events after all. So when the evidence is discovered so that your god can be examined by science, that will mean that your god isn't supernatural, and therefore not God - just a creation. Actually, your god is a creation of mankind.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>A load of bull eh? Would you be so kind as to explain how this is a load of incoherent bull? Just because you dont understand what im asking, doesnt mean that it is incoherent bull. If you dont have any valuable input, then shut your vaccuous trap!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>First of all, prove that there was a ' primary event '. Don't say 99% of the people accept it.. I want to see evidence that the Big Bang was THE primary event, and there wasn't anything before it. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I am saying that 99% of the pop of the planet believes this, and I'll give you a method to prove this true for yourself. STEP 1 Start asking everyone that you know if they believe in creation or evolution. If they believe in creation, then chalk that down as 1 for creation. STEP 2 If they believe in evolution, ask them what they think of the big bang theory. If they believe that the current big bang model is correct, then chalk that one up as someone who believes there was a creation event. STEP 3 for the people who do not believe either, inquire about there beliefs, and let me know, cause it should be pretty interesting. I think that this should support my argument quite well. And by the way, with the current big bang model, time was created at the moment of the big bang hence there was no before.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Except, of course, in imaginary time. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I dont understand this statement. Are you trying to mock me?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>N o.. http://www.pbs.org/wnet/hawking/stra...imaginary.html <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Cool. Sorry bout that. I'm used to getting cut down by people that dont share my views. This is interesting. I wonder if this imaginary time would theoretically have a direction that would be opposite of our current timeline?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>If I'm so pathetic why don't you start debating my on my OP here. by the way, I could care less what evolutionists think of my posting habits. Come to think of it I may go find another board to post on.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>He won't ' debate ' your posts here for the same reason I won't. You run away from them every time you encounter serious resistance. We won't play shotgun with you. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>your version of " serious resistance " is blathering, changing the subject, lying and having no regards for reality. And when that doesn't work you resort to attacking me personally. Why don't you get busy debating the substance of my OP if you are so sure of yourself....? And by the way.... the artwork originally found were authentic and not mass-produced.... thousands of them were found and authorities desperately tried to keep them from being revealed to the public.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That's pretty damn funny comming from you. If I am wrong why do you have countless threads that have been abandoned after you encountered people who refuted you? I don't play shotgun with frauds. Look up Gulliable in the dictionary. http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CH/CH710_1.html Try again. Basilio Uchuya and his wife admit to drawing them to sell to Tourists based on comic books. You fell for a tourists scheme! How amusing. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>boy that link was convincing...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It should be for someone as gulliable as you are. But back to the point If I am wrong why do you have countless threads that have been abandoned after you encountered people who refuted you?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Creation science is often disproven. It is based on a web of lies, ignorance and baseless claims. Claims that systems " must have been designed " can be scientifically objected to, what can not is supernatural or religious claims. It is the " creation scientists " attempt to prove their religious theses with science which is the problem. The idea that evolution is contrary to god is an idea that you and other creationists alone hold. The morality of creationism is this ; to lie, to speak of things which you are ignorant while claiming to be an authority, to use any means, regardless of how dishonest or fallacious to convince an audience of your correctness, to appeal to their emotions and ignorance rather than their minds. Is the intentional spreading of ignorance a " morality " we should be concerned about? Absolutely. Is the creationist movement a threat to science? Absolutely, in America. That wouldn't prove they are the same... " ID " and " creation science " both claim to scientifically prove creation, how does this show science is contrary to a belief in supernatural creation?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What's the difference between creation science, and supernatural creation? Claims that systems " cannot have been designed " in spite of very recent discoveries of the complexities of life, can also be scientifically objected to. It is " evolutionists " who often attempt to prove atheism with science that is also a problem. Nah, anyone who reads the hatred of religion and God on these forums knows it too. Sounds like exactly what goes on in todays universities about evolution! Really, the morality of creationism is largely that man is on a level above animals. That is a key difference between creation and evolution. If man is a mere animal, a creature of instinct, he is malleable to state control ; he can be trained and bred like any other animal. It also lays foundations for governments to control human reproduction and family size. Life and Death can be defined by science through it's definitions of several stages of brain death ; science can determine the differences in worth between a newborn and a fetus etc etc. These things make a world of difference in how today's science operates, and how it's funded. By opposing any type of study that's not based on atheism. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Show me these claims. Evolutionist is a made up word and doesn't have a clear meaning, it apparently means " duh I went to creationist university and don't know the differenace between a biologist and a paleontolgist ". Show me these " evolutionists " who attempt to prove atheism with science. It appears to me they are a figment of your imagination. No, the morality of creationism is to make up a bunch of XXXX and use dishonest means to try and give it scientific credibility. Man can be evolved and be on a level above the other animals, or created and on the same level as them. You are correct however that many creationists see the acceptance of their thesis as a great moral struggle - they are so willing to misrepresent the truth because they believe they are doing god's will.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Enthusiastic ( or maybe panicky ) attempts throughout the scientific community to " disprove " irreducible complexity. Ever hear of Carl Sagan? Richard Lewontin? How about Richard Dawkins, and his book, " The Blind Watchmaker "? Or the website talkorigins? No, it's the morality of atheism that attempts to do that. That is true for many worldviews, as long as they reject the Bible. And the enthusiasm ( or panic ) of evolutionists to oppose it shows that they have an equally great moral struggle - to misrepresent things and fill gaps, to establish atheism. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Irreducible complexity is the claim something must have been designed, since it cannot have evolved. You claim scientists set out to prove things " cannot have been designed ". Are you lying, or simply in need of a lesson in basic comprehension? Show me where they claim or attempt to " prove atheism ".<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Comprehension? My claim " cannot have been designed ", and " to disprove irreducible complexity ", go together well. This is from the preface of Dawkins book, his words ; http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/...tchmaker.shtml The " ONLY KNOWN THEORY " - No God. Atheism means " Disbelief in, or denial of the existance of God or gods. http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=atheism I can't make it any clearer than that. It's also obvious that Dawkins does a good job of " persuading the reader " too, considering this review from the same link ; Reviews of Dawkins ' book show that many thousands, ( if not millions ) influenced by Dawkins book hold it too. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>And surprise surprise there is nothing about proving atheism there. You may interpret his words in an odd fashion to come to that conclusion, you wish to imagine that is what he is saying. Dawkins explicitly notes that some things, like god, unicorns or leprechauns can not be disproven. What dawkins shows is that neither god nor leprechauns are necessary for explaining the origins of mankind. Does this disprove god? Is it an attempt to? Absolutely not. Similarly, showing that things can evolve ( through disproving irreducible complexity ) does not show that they must have evolved, it leaves open the possibility they were designed by an enclave of rebel unicorns and leprechauns. So basically what we have here is another example of dishonest / ignorant creationist argument ( the lines are somewhat blurred ). Creationists who have never read authors, except for quotes from creationist websites, taken out of context, claim to know what these authors " really mean " and end up attributing to them views they do not hold.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You're the one that's ignorant. You stated that creationists cannot argue without resorting to fallacies, generalities are clearly false. I've never seen such an idiotic comment. All you've done is resort to personal attacks. You're an embarrassment, but I assume you already know that.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>In normal debates, one side makes a point, the other tries to refute it. In evolution vs literal creationists, literal creationists make arguments and then refute themselves And I fully know you won't attempt to actually refute me. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>This is your tactic. When your arguments are shown to be insane, simply change the subject and resort to personal attacks.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Let's see. You claim that my statement about the dishonesty of creationists is wrong., specifically you argue that creationists don't use fallacies Then you go and use a fallacy of changing the subject. Seriously. People may think I'm in cahoots with you. I say predict and BAM you go and prove it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Show me where I changed the subject. Show me where I stated that I'm a creationist. Show me where I specifically said that your statement about the dishonesty of creationists is wrong. Show me where I stated that creationists don't use fallacies. You're an embarrassment and a liar. Admit it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>http://www.4forums.com/political/331739-post12.html http://www.4forums.com/political/331738-post9.html Perhaps you need to read better? I stated this : Fair enough. You have yet to argue for literal creationism. So you'll admit that creationists do use dishonest methods? You're reported. Enjoy. Btw, thanks again for proving my prediction true. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I did not change the subject. I was responding to your opening post. So you admit that you lied? I never said that. You said I stated something in which I clearly did not. you're the one who resorted to personal attacks first. Don't dish out what you can't take. It's clear that you're a liar and that you have no defense.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>By changing the subject. Just because you reply doesn't mean you don't change the subject. I could reply with gibberish. You apparently missed the post where you claimed that creationwiki had refuted talkorigins. As Talkorigins supports the TOH, and since you think that that TO is incorrect, well, you do the math. Do you know what a question is? In the English Langauge, a question is meant to gain clarification. My question clearly did not accuse you of saying such, only requesting clarification to whether or not you believed creationists used dishonest tactics. Perhaps you should enroll in a English Comprehension course at your local college? See above. Google is a good tool for finding such classes. Keep insulting me. Not only will it get you warnings, but it keeps proving my point. You have no argument. Only insults. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I never changed the subject. The " i'm right cuz i say so " argument is getting old. Because if I support a theory, I've got to agree with everyone else who supports the theory, right? No matter how asinine their arguments are? I have yet to see a single thing you've posted that would be indicative of any intelligence. Just because someone agrees with you on an issue doesn't mean they have to agree with every asinine thing you say Your question implied it. " So basically you're an #####? " is not asking for clarification, it's an implied statement. You resorted to insults when all I did was disagree with you. don't use insults if you can't take it<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I agree that the following is true : c + e > ( c - e ) or ( e - c ) because of the OR... that is, c + e > c - e. However, a better set of inequalities is as follows : c + e > c - e e - c > e + c And therefore we also have : e - c > c - e Or in other words : e - c > e + c > c - e So a better representation of the original inequality is : e - c > ( c - e ) AND ( e + c )<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Oops, I think YOU made a mistake here on the second one. This is the correct inequality based off of my original equation. e-c < e + c So, start over again. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No, I didn't. So? I wasn't just re-expressing YOUR inequalities. In fact, I made it clear that I was providing BETTER inequalities than you did. YOU EVEN QUOTED ME AS SAYING THAT!!! Then you turn right around and pretend that I didn't anything of the sort?!?! Get real dude. PS : The most correct representation of the three main combinations of e and c is as follows ( one which I did present in the post you are replying to ) : e - c > e + c > c - e<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Yeah.. caught that... But, hey.. I think you made a mistake. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Oh really? < snicker > Then why don't you : 1 ) explain exactly how my second statement is wrong and 2 ) how the rest of your post was not an attempt to explain how you wrongly believed my statement to be wrong Here is your entire post : Oh, and keep your lie - I mean, explanation - consistent with your entire post!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I like Almond Joy. Ask an opinion based question, get an opinion based answer. Yours is wrong because mine is right. Honestly, you lost me. I guess you win. ( unless I'm lying, I guess )<br><b>S1:1-  </b>... I'm not concerned with supporting evidence...<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That is self evident. Oh it is Genesis ( specifically the parts to do with the creation of the Earth and life upon it and the flood story ) that has been proven to be utterly untrue. As you are not concerned with supporting evidence though, you are free to believe otherwise. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>When has the creation of the Earth and the life upon it ever been proven false? By who? You found someone who has disproven God? Wow, I'm impressed.. unfortunately, I don't believe you.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I have no idea. I wasn't aware it had been. No. Please quit the strawmen construction. It is tedious. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Didn't realize that I was. You stated that Genesis had been disproven, I wanted to know who disproved it. No hidden agenda.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Nope I stated that " it is Genesis ( specifically the parts to do with the creation of the Earth and life upon it and the flood story ) that has been proven to be utterly untrue " If you have no hidden agenda, perhaps you have reading difficulties as I neither claimed that god has been proven false nor than it has been proven that the Earth and life upon it were not created. It has however been proven that the version of creation specified in Genesis is false. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Gotcha, I was reading too much into it. I don't believe that Genesis can only be read literally. It's truth is not compromised from a metaphorical ( and other reasons per Trebor ) standpoint.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I know this sounds weird, but I think that one day, when we do get to the point where we've almost got it ALL figured out, that instead of faith, love, and the intangibles getting LESS credit, they will simply turn out to be as true as some believe that they are now. And.. to answer your question, Life means more to me, it gains value, when it has a grander purpose than.. nothing.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Well, all right. As I " look to the furture " I just wonder what science will eek out of life. But I don't " believe " that that they'll be able to prove one thing over some other thing. I just don't know what will happen. As for something like life on other planets to give another example, I suppose that we will one day discover that life is not unique to the Earth, but I don't really know that and I don't " believe " it or " disbelieve " it. As for purpose, do you just have a hunch that life has some grand purpose or do you have a strong belief in such? If so, do you speculate upon what that purpose may be? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>My hunch turned into a strong belief over time. I have come to understand that I, nor any other human has the capacity to understand the " grand purpose ". I came to this realization when I realized that our minds have certain limitations. Over time, my awe of the universe has manifested itself in appreciation, praise, and growth. This is what I feel that I can lend.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well, I have this hunch, maybe even a strong belief, that no human has the capacity to even determine if there is such a thing as the " grand purpose ". <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Too late...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Too late for what? So, here's a nice NYT article that I thought I'd throw in here. I think this article does a good job of explaining the debate in a fair and balanced way while still getting across the fact that Intellegent Design is pseudoscience and evolutionary theory still works ( well ). http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/22/na...rtner=homepage<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The problem with marrying evo and Creation bmittking is that evo stands in direct opposition to the claims of Genesis and the basic concept that an intelligent and personal God spoke creation into being. The two belief systems are as diametrically opposed as night and day and you can't believe one without corrupting the other. In order to accept evo you must disregard key elements of Genesis and other scriptural principles which God declares are absolute. I admit I can't explain the so called inconsistencies between what the bible say's and what we " think " we know, but I err on the side of trusting God's explanation until He can tell me differently Himself some day. My only other option is to trust Man over God and that is the greatest lessen we learn from the Old Testament, that Israel so mistakenly did so often that destroyed their relationship with God and was defined as faithlessness by Him.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Please explain how you came to the conclusion that evolution and creation are complete opposites based on a non-literal interpretation of the bible. There is evidence of evolution, so I believe it happened. In my heart I believe God exists, so I believe he created the world. Is it really that farfetched to believe that the theories could exist in harmony, and in fact that evolution was a creation of God? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>If you are doing what many cultural christians do and accepting what is convenient about both belief systems and marrying them together so as to still be able to claim a type of intellectual spiritualism, then you are deluding yourself by compromising what the Creation story is with man made science, because the whole principle behind true evolution is that man evolved NATURALLY and SPONTANEOUSLY from organic matter billions of years ago. And from that humble beginning in the primordial ooze, all life formed from single celled bacteria or enzymes or whatever. But we weren't created by an intelligent being. So in order to accept evolution you must deny what the bible says about our creation by a loving and personal God. Unfortunately, that is the choice we have if we are to claim to believe in God. And God doesn't allow us to compromise.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I am not following my beliefs because it's convenient. I never said I believed in the whole evolution theory, either. I believe that the emergence of life is anything but spontaneous and random, which leads me to believe in a creator. Think about it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Then the good news is that you're not really an evolutionist. You are having a hard time accepting how geological evidence conflicts with Genesis so you attempt to accept both as rational beliefs. And I can respect you for that ; but don't compromise what the Torah tells you just for the sake of satisfying the man made science of secular humanists who have no real clue of Mans origins as they do everything they can to prove that we came into being naturally, apart from any participation of a loving and personal God by the name of Adonai, Jehovah and Yahweh. Just remember that it isn't necessary to answer all questions that life throws at us if we have confidence that our heavenly Father knows the answers to those questions and will give us the answers in His perfect time. Seleh...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I am an evolutionist, and a creationist. Don't ever accuse me of compromising my religion for science. This is truly what I believe, and I am not in denial. Don't tell me what to think. You can attempt to sway my beliefs with logic, and I will try to keep an open mind, but don't tell me what my beliefs are, and I won't tell you yours. Honestly, I believe in God. I believe in evolution. I believe that many biblical stories are metaphors for what actually happened. For example, the flood could have been a glorified witch hunt for non-believers, not unlike he Crusades. You still haven't supported your argument that evolution and a non-literal interpretation of the Bible are complete opposites. Furthermore, don't ever say I don't have confidence in God. Ever. I have my faith in God and man, but I guess that it's too much for you to handle to believe that religion and science can coexist. Guess what? opposites can exist together.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Marc 9000 : Really? Support the statement that    naturalists control the definition of science   . Give me statistics. You can    t because the statement is just whinning.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I support it with this one paragraph - thoughts from a Darwinist that are honest enough to not be tainted with personal desire to sway the opinion of the reader. Quote : Richard Lewontin You have a hard time finding a " scientest " who considers ID a valid scientific theory, and I have an equally hard time finding anyone who can logically prove the above paragraph wrong. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Mr. Lewontin is allowed his opinion. An opinion is not a scientific theory either. You have not named a scientists and you have not given me any factual evidence to support the statement that    naturalists control the definition of science   . You do admit that you can't name a scientist that can't find a scientist who considers ID a valid scientific theory. In that case, the question becomes " Do we teaching things that are not valid scientific theories in a science class? '' Do you think we do?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, I don't admit it - I don't know what your definition of " scientest " is. Dictionary.com defines one like this ; I guess I need your opinion of what " expert knowledge " is. Does your " scientest " have to be on the public payroll? Does Micheal Behe not fit the bill for you? Many PEOPLE consider ID to be a valid scientific theory. Why is that not good enough for you? Must we have only the intelligensia make our decisions for us? How familiar are you with the US Constitution? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>My daughter and all her friends considered it a fact that Santa came down the chimney. Should we teach that in science class too? You    re just dancing as fast as you can because you can    t name one scientist who has demonstrated that ID is a valid scientific theory. As far as Micheal Behe, he acknowledges that Intelligent Design is not a valid scientific theory. He states,    You can't prove Intelligent Design by experiment   . A valid scientific theory has to be demonstraated through experimentation.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You also can't prove the origin of the first life on earth happened purely by chance. Doesn't that mean all subsequental evolution is also not a valid scientific theory? Why not? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Because evolution is a scientific theory not a fact. Intelligent Design is a belief not a scientific theory. Your continuing inability to grasp this is mind boggling. It is high school science. You are so obsessed with proving your dogma that the truth and the facts have become your enemies.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>A closed mind is easily boggled. Can you see the difference between science as a tool, and scientific philosophy as a worldview? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Please define " Scientific Philosophy ".<br><b> S2:5-  </b>It is a WORLDVIEW. Many evolutionists can argueably claim to have " no religion ", to view everything to do with religion from an outside, neutral position. Many in the newsmedia are masters of this. But everyone has a worldview, a perspective that guides their daily lives / a lens through which they view the world. They develop largely through childhood. They deserve to see more than one in school. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>" It is a WORLDVIEW " is not a definition. Scientific Philosophy is a specific study, I am just not sure that you know the meaning of the term.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Check this site ; http://www.discovery.org/csc/aboutCSC.php A few notable names there are Micheal Behe, William Dembski, and Phillip Johnson. They may not fit your definition of " scientests ", but they have some interesting things to say.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Behe is certainly a very talented and able scientist in the field of biochemistry - he just let his religion and incredulity get in the way when it comes to descent and evolution. Dembski isn't a scientist - he is a mathematian / theologian, and nor is Phillip E. Johnson, a Professor of Law. Johnson in particualr should stick to his areas of expertise - besides rubbishing evolution he also likes to spend time advocating that HIV and AIDS are unrelated. I bet the professional Medical community appreciates his input on that as much as paleontologists do regarding evolution. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Are there not also many very talented and able scientests who let their personal atheism ( and livelihood ) get in the way when it comes to ID?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, as there are plenty of evolutionists who believe in God - its not a matter of religious outlook but the ability to discern the best model to explain the evidence to hand. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>There are actually plenty of both. The most vocal and often most politically influential are the ones who are closed minded about their atheism. The " talk origins " web site is loaded with them.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>What on earth do you mean by " closed minded about their atheism "? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Those who " refuse to allow a divine foot in the door ". Those who discard any scientific evidence that corresponds with the Bible. Those who BEGIN with the belief that there is no God - a predetermined conclusion that their research must lead to.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>But then you would always need to state it, this is redundant so it is reasonable not to bother.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Not at all. When you continually state something that you supposedly don't really believe, it gives the appearance of a belief. That's what you're doing here. You argue against Creation, by appealing to the facts as known by science, but then you also argue that you're not really sure about them anyway. It's an odd stance to take. And it is part of the variance within evolutionists arguments ; it's a fact, then it's not, your certain that Creation is not true, but then you can't be certain of anything etc. You are certain as best you can be of evolution, but this is based on evidences you're not really sure how to cobble together. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No other stance makes sense to me.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Sure, then you make a case for a ' just so ' belief in evolution. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I don't understand your point. Perhaps you could give us an argument that is not a ' just so ' argument<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Very cute. I already did. It's in this thread. See rebuttal to Mach re : evolution just based on evidence. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Sorry I was not specific enough. Give an example of argument that is not a just so argument that deals with the diversity of life on earth. Also what EXACTLY do you mean by saying " very cute "?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Why should I? You're content to let arguments go from your own camp that are ' just-so '. I see no reason why I should have to do anything different, if that's the accepted way of arguing. Far too long people have made comments about my arguments such as " they were refuted somewhere else ", and I have been at pains to go and reference mine. It is all too easy for you to do nothing but post opinions. I think I'll just do the same for a while, :) as I have a long-weekend. Further to that, should I present another science argument that gives a just-so argument, how would that validate / invalidate anything? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I don't understand your " just-so " critique. I don't undestand why my questions about it are " cute ". If you give an ANY argument about origin of life that is not ' just so ' I might understand your criticism. It can be for or against " my camp ". Or perhaps you can tell me the " just so arguments " that I tolerate.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Oh ok. By that definition, your god was wrong.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>A perfect example of why Christian fundamentalismm and evolution can't co-exist. If God is wrong, then the Bible is wrong. Evolution contradicts the Bible, plain and simple. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I don't think anyone argued that Christian fundamentalism was able to co-exist with reality. It contradicts a literal interpretation of the Bible.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Please stop making statements that have nothing whatsoever to do with the debate at hand. We're not talking about Christian fundamentalism and " reality ". And...? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Sure we are. Creationism vs all the sciences ( including the biological Theory of Evolution ) and reality. And few people hold that view anymore.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Last time I checked, it was a debate about religion and evolution co-existing. Not a debate about Creationism vs. " science " and " reality ". Few people literally interpret the Bible anymore? I'd like to see the statistics on that.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>and what would that be? Would it be a violation of the laws of physics, whatever that is, if I could think or believe myself into healing a disease or various medical condition?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The laws of physics don't preclude neural activity impacting physical reality, they require that it take place via a physical mechanism. eg positive thinking may improves serotonin levels and consequently white blood cell production, or some other mechanic. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>so what about the idea, though, that if I move into a new location and my subconscious mind generates a new physical trait to adapt me to the situation. In this way my mere thoughts ( non-physical ) would be creating a new physical body... aka, getting something from nothing -- pulling a rabbit out of a hat. ( I can show you numerous examples of this in the animal kindom if you wish. ) Also, what about non-locality. I could post some some weird stuff from physics... any of that count? I'm trying to pin down what is considered " miracle. " And why does God have to be involved in a " miracle " anyway?... what if I were to believe that since humans were created in the image of God that we are all capable ( or at least have the capacity ) of performing our own miracles? O, Ye of little faith -- Jesus<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Is it the " mind " that creates the change, or the electrochemical processes that accompany ( or are ) it? What you are doing is assuming when the physical mechanisms are unknown, things happen by magic. This seems like groundless superstition to me. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I don't know if they're " magic " or not -- no one will give me a defintion of magic. Is it the " mind " that creates the change, or the electrochemical processes that accompany ( or are ) it? something had to stimulate these specific electrochemical processes.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>And as far as we can tell, they're being stimulated by prior electrochemical processes, some internal, some external. Photon hits photoreceptor, chemical change takes place that sends an electrical signal, triggering a cascade of processes. As far as we can tell, at the level of electrical, chemical, motor activity of the body, there isn't any room for an independent mind. All the physical events taking place appear to have a prior physical cause. That's not to say there's no " mind ", its just a different level of explanation of the same thing. Just as a " crowd " is a different level of explanation for a group of people. A physical event without a prior physical cause - now that would be magic. Maybe the start of the universe, or maybe the behaviour of quantum particles works this way - then again maybe they don't, and we just don't understand the physics behind them, yet. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>interesting last statement.... and I think I would agree... not only that, but I think if thoughts / awareness indeed translate into new physiology, then " miracle " is the only explanation. Let's say, for example, that a white fish finds its way to a speckled background and then shortly after alters its color to speckled so it can blend in. How could this be anything but a miracle? There is nothing physical about being aware ( especially subconsciously ) of a particular background color.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Or is there? Awareness still takes place in the physical realm of electrochemical brain processes. I see no reason to believe spotted fish are any different in this regard. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>or is it the other way around ; is it that the electrochemical brain processes operate in the mental / conscious realm. It seems to me that the physcial must follow the lead of the mental.... if, for example, I ask you to picture a monkey standing on the back of an elephant, sure enough, the correct neurons will fire in your brain to make that happen... but you first made the conscious decision ( based on my suggestion ) to picture this. Your brain did not fire these neurons in advance of my question.... your physical electro-chemical activity, then, is the effect, not the cause. By you saying that no matter matter rules over the mind simply because all mind is within the body is flippantly dismissing thousands of years of debate...... Just because a physical body exists does not rule out that a non-physical mind is in control of it. It could be that the physical body is just the physical manifestation of the mind.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Ok, that seems intuitively reasonable to me too, but dualism of this variety has serious logical flaws. And this conscious decision takes place in.... different neurons. No, it fired different neurons in advance of my question. To really break it down we could talk about listening neurons, hearing neurons, consciousness neurons and visualisation neurons - that isn't really an accurate reflection of the complexities of brain structure, but it adequately illustrates the point that physical brain activity doesn't only start taking place at the post-decision level. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>but you first made the conscious decision ( based on my suggestion ) to picture this Actually, as I understand it, all the important stuff happens at the synapse... which is not really in the neuron at all. And until you can present me with a neuron or neurons that are responsible for picturing an elephant with a monkey standing on it, the idea that thoughts occur / originate within the confines of a neuron is merely speculation.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Clearly I didn't " decide " until after I " heard " and " understood " the question, and " felt " a certain way towards it, and any number of processes with neurological correlates took place, there's no gap in the process which requires the intervention of a mind creating action from nothing. I don't know where you heard that, but it's wrong. Such as the kind you'd encounter and extensively debate over the course of a 13 week philosophy of mind course, some of which can be found at the bottom of the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism...osophy_of_mind) article. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>SS : Actually, as I understand it, all the important stuff happens at the synapse... hmmm... really : HHMI Bulletin : The Synapse Revealed Virtually any cognitive task requires that the brain function on many different levels, from the individual molecules in cell membranes to far-flung neural circuits that encompass many cerebral regions. But at the center of the action is the " synapse "    the narrow cleft between neurons where one brain cell sends signals to another. This neural structure is essential to perception, behavior, memory, and thinking. " Without synapses, the brain would be just a collection of isolated neurons, " says New York University neuroscientist Joseph E. LeDoux, author of Synaptic Self : How Our Brains Become Who We Are. " Synapses are the gateway for information flowing into the brain, the means of communication within the brain, and the means by which behavior emerges from the brain. "<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What if God created the Heavens, the Earth and all life as described in Genesis less than 10,000 years ago, AND allowed life to evolve through random mutation by way of natural selection since then?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>why bother about evolution then? according to the Genesis it took her less than a week to create the world as it is now. So you are a creationist and an evolutionist. Strange combination Obviously you are not a scientist, neither psychology nor economics are science. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It is a common misconception, and one you apparently hold, that the purpose of studying evolution is to refute god. Whether the earth is 10,000 years old is irrelevant to whether evolution is true and / or useful to understand. I never claimed to be a scientist... Psychology is a broad discipline encompassing everything from computer modelling of cognitive theories, through neurobiology, which is simply biology, itself a subset of chemistry, itself a subset of physics, applied to the brain. In the context of this discussion, the relevant aspect of psychology is neurobiology, so whatever your half baked thoughts are on the rest of the discipline, they're entirely irrelevant to this thread. Thanks for your input.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Don    t put words in my mouth, I never said ( and you know it ) that the purpose of evolution is to disprove the existence of God. If you were a scientist, which evidently you are not ( and you admit it, thanks ) you would know that God ( or her negation ) is never part of any scientific theory. God is irrelevant to Science, the moment you introduce her into science it ceases to be science. Even people who are not scientists know that evolution of life on Earth has been taking place for billions of years so your    what if God created the world 10 000 years ago    is an    if    either originated by ignorance or sarcasm. Everything is a subset of something but it doesn    t mean that because of that reductionism you can use Quantum mechanics and string theory to explain the mind. You are so good at sending people to learn about this or that, it would be great if you would follow your own advice for once for it when it comes half baked mumbo jumbo you are numero uno <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Then of course you realise that there's no conflict between evolution and special creation... Actually it means exactly that. The laws of physics don't break down inside the brain. We choose to operate at a higher level of abstraction because the quantum level is simply too detailed for our purposes, we don't want to know about what happens to every quark, we want to know what happens at the level of the cell, neuron or brain region. I wouldn't have to if you bothered to do some research before opening your mouth. Making pointless and ignorant blanket statements like " psychology isn't a science " marks you as someone with who intelligent discussion is impossible. I completely understand if you hold a philosophical stance contra mainstream psychology, a la Tom Cruise, but you don't even have Tom Cruise's level of thought put into what you say, it's just something you heard and repeated without bothering to think about it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>how do you know I never I thought about it and repeated it without bother to think about it? look, I don't care for your insults. I expected better from you but... Chao, the thread is yours. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Then why come out with #### like " why bother about evolution then? according to the Genesis it took her less than a week to create the world as it is now. " Because if you bothered to think about it, you'd realise that the controversies around psychology as a science have nothing to do with neurobiology. If you bothered to think about it, you'd be able to explain your view without resorting to cutting and pasting the first thing that comes up when you google psychology not science - Google Search Well you thought wrong, if that were the case there'd be no Chemists, only Physicists. That's not my occupation, no.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>because you said what if the world was created as per the Bible and then evolved in 10 thousands years. the world was created complete, totally evolved according to the Bible so evolution was unneeded. it was you who came up with that absurd ' if ' not me. of course not, psychology, as that link shows, does not qualify as science. by the way you are always sending people to links, obviously you are unable to explain your views without resorting to it, but you don't like it when it is done to you. chemists work at the necessary level But it is what you got a degree in, right?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>... God is a personal God, and a concerned and loving Father who cares and responds to our needs at a moments notice.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Nicely summed, Archie. A personal God to you and you alone. Your personal God does nothing whatsoever to benefit anybody else. How can anybody else benefit? It just confirms that, being personal, it's all purely in your imagination, and you're afraid to face reality. You need the comfort of a personal God. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>So you're saying that I am the only born again believer on Earth charlie? I and I alone claim that God is who I say He is? You have one high opinion of me charlie not to realize that there are hundreds of millions of born again believers on Earth right now. It is a typical debating method to minimize ones opponant in order to weaken the strength of their stance but nobody is dumb enough to believe that I am the only believer there is, so you just succeeded in minimizing your own credibility.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>OK, Archie, what don't you understand by the terms : Your God. No-one else's. The fact that millions world-wide seek solace and an emotional crutch in an imagined deity of their own making ( however common the foundation ) only strengthens my argument. There is nothing to suggest that any of your experiences are other than anecdotal, being totally unverifiable or testable. a. nobody said or even hinted that you were the only believer there is. You persistently air your own viewpoint as the only valid one because your God is your personal God. ; b. your quote above is an exceptionally transparent strawman. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Sorry, but that statement clearly implies that God is a personal God to me alone and nobody else. If that isn't what you meant to say then learn how to communicate more clearly. You insult me and all believer again charlie, and you deceive yourself further by assuming that our submission to a Holy God is an emotional crutch in an imagined deity. And again with the testable and verifiable requirements as if you can find the God who created everything in a test tube. How sad and wanting I find you to be charlie. A true empty vessel. Oh really? I'm exaggerating what you said? Here is your quote, read it for yourself and tell me how I should have interpreted this.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I'll ask again, Archie, what don't you understand by the term personal God? Do you know what the term personal actually means? A personal God is personal to you, nobody else. Millions of people have their own personal God. But it's personal to them. That's why you chose to use the term personal. So once again you are playing at being obtuse and introducing strawmen into what could be an interesting debate, but being made nonsensical by you and your unproven aberrations. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I see what you are implying charlie. God is " A " personal God, not " MY " personal God. But you already knew and understood very well that is what I said in my description of our relationship. But you have wasted this bandwidth arguing this non issue. And you claim I am introducing a strawman? You waste my time with meaningless minutia and then claim to seek an interesting debate. Can you comprehend the word hypocrite?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>( My bold above. ) I can certainly comprehend the word hypocrite. Here's a definition : Sums you up perfectly, Arch. Anyway, I digress. How do you differentiate between a personal God, and my personal God? Here's a small selection from your recent posts referencing a personal God. Who's is this personal God, if not yours? You're so keen to spout about your personal relationship with God, a relationship you can't demonstrate beyond the fanciful and anecdotal, a relationship which seems to give you the right to be arrogant, conceited, haughty and condescending to those who seek to challenge your assertions. I'll say it again, Arch, no-one here doubts that what you think happened to you is anything but your own interpretation. No-one denies that you firmly believe that. But what you keep refusing to answer is WHY we should believe you. How does your experience benefit us? How do your anecdotes prove that God and angels exist? Fanciful imaginings are not proof of anything and don't leave room for any sort of manoeuvre in trying to debate the issue. If you don't want to debate fanciful imaginings or subject yourself to intellectual criticism on a debating forum, why bring it up?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Name one. We need a savior. Jesus is the savior. Harry Potter and Santa Claus are fictitious ( hate to break it to you...). Imaginary friend... Jesus Christ. Wow. Who doesn't see the difference!?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Fred Phelps of the Westboro Baptist Church. Devout Five Point Calvinist. Represents their principles to a T. While Fred is certainly a lunatic, he still drawls a following teaching hate, prejudice, bigotry, anger, and vengeance. That's one, want more? No no. Perhaps you need a savior. I myself ( as many others ) have never felt the need to be saved. If you want to believe that you need a savior, feel free, but leave me out of it and keep it to yourself. Wait... your telling me that if deep down in my heart I believe in something that cannot be proven, and many people think does not exist that I am wasting my time on a fictitious belief? I would guess just about everyone who does not believe in Jesus as you do. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>What kind of religion does this man claim to preach for? Just wondering. Everyone needs a savior. If you deny this fact, you deceive yourself. But don't worry, many people do. Yes * braces for reply* Pretty sad, huh?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Christianity. Are you unfamiliar with Phelps? In your opinion. You opinion means jack spit to me. I have no need for a savior. I have no desire to be saved. Newsflash for ya chief ( or should I say cheif for you? )... not everyone subscribes to your personal philosophy. Why not worry about yourself and let the rest of us worry about ourselves? Yet you fail to embrace the irony. People forming their own opinions and believing what they feel works best for them... yes, sad indeed. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Ah, just wondering. Thx. Just a reminder : everyone, including Christians, sin. I am unfamiliar with Phelps, apparently for a good reason. I feel sorry for you. Only a ' jack spitter ' wouldn't. I am surprised at your stalling, why not just inform me of this irony directly? Ya, have you ever heard of scientology? Now that is pretty ridiculous.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well, perhaps you should do some reading. But now that I have given you one example of a christian preaching hate and bigotry, would you another example... or did that satisfy your requirements. Well, that's just your cross to bear. I don't feel sorry for myself in the least. But if you want to go on worrying about me... you go right ahead. Because the fact that you need it explained to you in the first place is the best part. As is the majority of organized religion. What's your point?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>God wants faith without a personal appearance. Everyone needs a savior. If you deny this fact, you deceive yourself. But don't worry, many people do.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Some gems from the slayer of fiends { whatever they are }. Nope. The creo vs evo debate is mostly about pre-christian myths of sheepherders. Old testament claims not NT at all. Don't worry FS many people deny that they need a savior without self-deception. Indeed its often due to self discovery. Nope, the persons who claim to speak for GOD want their beliefs validated on the basis of faith. GOD does not put in a personal appearance because he / it is a creation of men and a fictional one at that. Now just what is it you think I need to be " saved " from? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That is only half. The only thing that separates Christianity from Judaism ( both creationism religions ) is Jesus. You need to give evidence against both the books of the Old Testament as well as the New Testament. Self-discovery is okay as long as you are saved from your sin. If God were to come down in all of his glory right now, you'd be ' like the chaff that the wind drives away '. You, obviously, need to be saved from your sin. We all do. Accept Jesus into your heart ASAP. You don't need to read the Bible or even go to Church, just spread the Good News about Him. It's ' feinds ', not fiends. Jeeze.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Nope, the creation is only described in the OT, not in the NT. All the claims are OT and thats long before Christ and Christianity. What one discovers of course is that SIN ( esp original SIN ) is a guilt trap designed to enslave one to some religious authority who can bail you out, and that there is neither SIN nor the authority. This represents genuine salvation from the burden that organized Christian religons would place on your shoulders. Sorry but I cannot in good faith spread concepts and ideas which I find to be backwards and invalid. I leave that to you and yours. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Although creationism is described in the OT, Jesus refers to it a lot in the NT. Anyway, evos haven't disproved either wrong, so, it doesn't matter yet. When you sin, do something wrong or bad. I challenge you all to go through an entire day without even committing even one single sin. Once you realize how hard that is, try keeping track of how many sins you commit daily. Maybe then you'll see why we need a savior.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Ah yes the oldest con game in the world. Set up the game so its impossible to comply with the rules, then use the guilt effect to control the test subject. The Christians have managed to commercialize the whole concept on a mass scale. And even if a test subject thinks it has won the game and exhibits no guilt - there is always the mythical original and heritable sin to fall back on. In Adams fall we sinned all. Guilt is the father of........ economic returns!<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Name some of the products we wouldn't have without evolution. I'd like to check on how they actually originated. Links please? Not among atheists!! They are the only ones Richard Dawkins and others like him attack specifically, because they are the only ones relevant to western politics. I'm so glad you're back. " I'm simply telling the truth, so I have different debating standards than you ".<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Corn, wheat, potatoes, grapes, wine, flowers, nude mice, human beings. Will that do? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No it won't, I don't know if you intentionally missed the point or not. His implication was that without scientific study of evolution, and all the billions-of-years-old and God-is-not-necessary speculation that goes along with it, we wouldn't have been able to produce products that we have today. That products would be missing if all we do is work with and rearrange materials that we have to work with. What products would be missing?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Precisely the ones I mentioned previously and thousands upon thousand of others to boot. A full list is well beyond the scope of this forum. Nearly anything related to biology or medicine has benefited from the theory of evolution and there is a vastly larger set of products, tools, techniques to come! <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Be specific - the ones you mentioned were not. Corn, wheat, potatoes, grapes, wine, flowers, nude mice, human beings, would all be here if everyone on earth was a creationist, and you know it. I thought you'd come up with some kind of recent miracle medicine or something. Whatever it would be, I'd like to see how godless evolution brought it about.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Actually not! Especially the nude mice. And Corn, wheat, potatoes are just as impressive as any medical technology - they are what many of us live on! They all evolved and corn in particular in its modern form is the result of applying evolutionary theory and NDS to breeding increasingly more efficient and effective varieties. You can find a great deal about the genetics of corn and the breeding of disease resistant corn varieties on the net. I'll let you do the home work. As to wheat and evolution in a similar context look up the green revolution of the 1960 s and study the development of the dwarf wheats. Enjoy. Oh yes it was not GOD but rather the Rockefeller Foundation, Norman Bourlaug, and his mentor E.C. Stakeman. And of course these days we are using evolutionary concepts to deploy GE corns while at the same time avoiding so far as possible some of the evolutionary consequences of such strains. Oh yes you should examine the development of multiline small grains as part of an integrated pest control strategy. That particular technology is rooted deep into the evolutionary war between hosts and pathogens. Enjoy. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>No links? Are you describing evolution that takes billions of years, or chemical reactions and reproduction that happen comparatively quickly? The technological advances you describe actually come from mans capacity to aquire knowledge and skill in working with the here and now, and passing it along to future generations. It's not evolution at all, it's a building block process about knowledge of present day material.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You should acknowledge that there are different opinions on what a " fact " is. If we check dictionary.com, we find a pretty big array of descriptions of just what facts are, and some get very close to disagreeing with each other. We do find this statement there ; I believe that's true, and I'm sure many scientists don't. So there you have it, who is right? Could it be that many scientists believe it's possible to add a fact and a theory, and come up with a fact for the sum of the two? Or might they think that multiple additions, such as five facts + one theory equals a fact? Or maybe one fact + one theory + one hypothesis + one guess + one lick + one promise all equal a fact as long as it supports atheism? Actual facts are pretty hard to come by IMO. They should be so clear that they shouldn't be disputed. I even believe it's possible to add two facts and not always get a fact for the sum. The slightest bit of human desire or emotion changes it from a fact to a theory. To not acknowledge that science does this for political reasons all the time could be a VERY self destructive act, considering its eternal consequences.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Pot, meet kettle, you're black. And a atheist is not someone who disagrees with you despite your frequent use of it in that definition. If we check dictionary.com, we find a pretty big array of descriptions of just what facts are, and some get very close to disagreeing with each other. We do find this statement there ; Which is amusing as you use the products of those so called non-facts every day. How is it that you can reject the science which brings you great products? Geology is wrong but gasoline is real? What kind of asinine logic is that? So me getting angry makes gravity not true? I see you haven't changed at bit. You don't win many discussions do you? Exactly. Hence why politics needs to get out of science and why Bush should have never started his bullying of sciences to get what he wanted. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>There is a difference between present products and pre-historic proclamations. And you have changed? :) You " win " discussions? Bullying? Did you say something about pots and kettles?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Yes, but when the sciences that comes to the conclusion about the past that uses those conclusions to produce products that you use, the difference is rather minute. Creationists live a life of outright lies. They deny that evolution is true yet freely embrace the products of the sciences that say evolution is true. Evolution is wrong but geology which uses much of the same methods to estimate and find fossils and fossil fuels is true. Oh wait. Contradiction, but we're creationists, let's just pretend it still makes sense. All of the time. Your pasts post here haven't been kind to your reputation. And please answer the question about since when did religion and God for that matter only include Abrahamic beliefs. Merely stating the truth about your arguments is not bullying. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Name some of the products we wouldn't have without evolution. I'd like to check on how they actually originated. Links please? Not among atheists!! They are the only ones Richard Dawkins and others like him attack specifically, because they are the only ones relevant to western politics. I'm so glad you're back. " I'm simply telling the truth, so I have different debating standards than you ".<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You doing research? Has the sky fallen? Are pigs flying? Besides chemist already provided a list. Under your parameters of winning? That's questionable. Usually people consider someone who has to keep avoiding points and relying upon made up words to stay in the debate a loser. You think the opposite. Atheist : Anyone who disagrees with Mar c9000 extremely narrow point of researchless views. This is English. Not make up your own definitions language. Other religions have no problems with evolution. You are therefore, as always, wrong. How can evolution be atheistic when religions accept it? You never answered this question and always flee like a coward when addressed it. And atheists reject the notion of God. Evolution doesn't even discuss it. How can it be atheist when it neither rejects or accepts a deity? Evolution is far more accurately described as agnostic, not atheistic. STOP MAKING WORDS UP Yeah, I have standards were we don't lie, don't change definitions and don't act like a 5 year old running away from points he can't deal with.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>People make definitions. They then make statements that make sense according to those definitions. You interpret their statements terms of your own definitions. Maybe your definition are in a sense better but many people adopt the position that when someone defines things you intercept them using their definitions AND THEIR DEFINITIONS ALONE. You do not seem to think this should be done. This is the main reason why people treat you the way they do. It actually has little to do with them practicing objectivism or scientism.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Is this the reason you have four times called me a liar, and offered no proof? I didn't realise your lack of willingness to make it anything more than ad hominem was my fault. However, if you want to actually discuss the non-scientific nature of Scientism, feel free. If you want to discuss the irrational nature of Objectivism feel free. But as to people using their definitions alone, this is what happens when I debate an Objectivist on this forum. Is that a rational way of constructing an argument? a ) to make a statement b ) to re-state it as a rebuttal c ) to re-state it as ' proof ' d ) to declare no matter what ' evidences ' are presented, the original statement ' just-is ' correct. e ) to add that my own views are illogical, but this is ' not an insult ' based on a ) If you feel that is a proper and logical way to debate, then I can give you some links to Ayn Rand sites. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>If I make a statement and mention what definitions I am using then going through steps is b ) to e ) is not an invalid response to someone ignoring how I Define things and says my statement is wrong according to how they define things.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>In the explanation I gave to him, and now pass on to you, it's akin to saying An elephant is a fish that lives on cheese. No amount of evidence will convince me otherwise. All ' proofs ' that you can show me are illogical. And when you'd have every right to ask for me to prove that statement, I'd just say " No amount of evidences can convince me otherwise " and then re-state my position about the truth of my position. And you find that a valid debating technique? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So you put words in Machs mouth. This would be acceptable if you were not doing it in a malicious fashion to get some sort of sadistic pleasure but you were instead actually trying to get him to explain himself. At any rate it totally disproves your nonsense about how you above me because you do not put words into peoples mouths because you do the same. You were not being dishonest to start with I admit it would be wrong to deliberately misrepesent you but neither of the circumstances apply here.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I have also quoted from him in the past. Your ' conversation ' is a complete fabrication. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>LOL you know I do not claim you had the exact conservation with someone but you imply that is what I am suggesting to defend your honesty. I am actually enjoying your games now. I suppose you will stop playing.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Note also when I posted I said his argument is ' akin ' to... And also I have made use of quotes, when I felt them necessary... however your ' conversation ' is a compelte fabrication, and it is also akin to using ' x ' to prove ' y ' You don't hence you continually say Look out, I'm going to prove once and for all he's a liar, forget about the last four times I've said this... Only everyone's still waiting. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I have another question for you to pretend to answer. Is there any difference between saying " his argument is akin to " and " using his logic "? Montalban will of course avoid this question like the others. Total victory is sweet.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>A statement proposing the explanation of a phenomenon can either be a hypothesis ( untested and unverified ) or a conclusion ( tested and verified ). Since a statement cannot be verified and unveirfied at the same time, it cannot be a hypothesis and a conclusion at the same time. The same statement that started as the hypothesis can end up being the conclusion, but at that time it is no longer a hypothesis. People purporting to be scientists present conclusions beased on incomplete testing and by not following the scientific method all the time. In a captialist system, especially in america, what is accepted as backed by science has more to do with what the media promotes as true than what has been actually verified by the scientific method. Regardless of how much another scientists refutes the claim based on real science, it is the acceptance by the public that allow multi-million dollar corporations to commit fraud and get away with it. And because they can control what the media says through money, they can financially benefit through the manipulation of the public to accept their claims.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>A conclusion is not a tested verified hypothesis, it is merely the statement whose truth value is claimed to be dependent on supporting statements in an argument. You're telling me, AGCC irrational evolution, absurd diets, everything causes cancer. This is a cultural problem, people think science is an authority that must be blindly accepted. Corporations control the media? rofl. The media controls the media, and they are left wing lunatics who would rather cut the throat of a successful corporation than lie for them. They have their own agendas and when companies spring up to take advantage of the falsehoods they spread do not confuse cause and effect. Yet you still have made no progress towards explaining why a financially motivated scientist can't practice science. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I never said a financially motivated scientist can't practice science. I said a scientific conclusion cannot be derived because of financial motivation. You cannot pay a scientist to come up with a conclusion that scientific testing can't verify.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You said : You have changed the claimed relationship. Now you are claiming that financial motivation cannot make non-science science. This is obvious. Before you were claiming that financial motivation could make science non-science, you have not supported this. In the above quote you do not mention anything about the conclusion except that it was the source of financial motivation. Since you did not include any other conditions your statement must apply to cases in which the scientific method is followed as well as those in which it is not. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>What? Financial motivation cannot make an unverified conclusion into a scientifically verified conclusion. That's what I've been saying all along, in both instances that you quote me. I never said otherwise, neither do I need to support a claim I never made. Now I have no idea where the disagreement even is, because you've confused what I've said, along with interjecting your own ideas of what I've implied, that I don't even know what the point of the dabate is anymore.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>In this statement the subject is the scientist : Let us take it one step at a time. Scientist A is hired by a company to research subject B. They tell him he will only be paid if he reaches conclusion 1. Using the scientific method, and repeatable and conclusive experiment he arrives at conclusion 1. Your statement applies to this scenario because it is a scientist who is motivated by financial gain to arrive at a particular conclusion. Why is it not science? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The scientist arrived at conclusion 1 because he followed the scientific method and it verified that conclusion 1 is supported by the research. He did not reach the conclusion because he was paid to. The presence of money or any other reward is irrelevant to the evidence supporting the conclusion. You cannot pay a scientist any sum of money to arrive at a scientific conclusion that science in itself cannot support. Any such occurence is unscientific. Which is what I've been saying from the onset.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You are modifying your statement, which did not contain a causal condition but merely a condition. Not : I agree, which is why I said that if a scientist is reports a particular conclusion because it will give him financial gain, then its not science. Neither pure nor true nor any other type. Even that would not be sufficient, because it could be argued that he followed the scientific method because he was paid to ; and thus financial motivation is still in the causal chain. You would have to say : I agree, which is why I said that if a scientist is reports a particular conclusion only because it will give him financial gain, then its not science. Neither pure nor true nor any other type. All hypotheses are the conclusions of the experiments which will support them. Note in Winston's example the money is returned if the tests fails, thus the money was not offered for mere testing, but for a particular result. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>In other words, you disagree with what I said, then rewrite what I said, then agreed with it. Fair enough. Agreed. However, you cannot know whether the test will support the hypothesis until the test is run, at which time it becomes a conclusion. These semantics games are boring. No disagreement here either. You said that 2 of the 4 scenarios Winston mentioned entailed real science ( patting yourself on the back ), when Winston just reiterated the point that if the scientist came to the conclusion that the company wanted him to because they were paying him to do so, then that's not science, which is what we have all been saying from the beginning.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Problem is you didn't say it, what you did say was incorrect and not what you switched to. The conclusion refers to the statements relationship in logical expression, it's label is not dependent on the truth of the premises or even the quality of the logic. So no, it is a conclusion before and after. You said more than that, you said that those two scenarios weren't scientist either.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Isn't that the exact definition of why people have belief in evolution. Your funny. :p ( ie. We don't know how it was done, but it happened, so even though we can't actually prove it, we must be right. So much for that theory. Don't you see that is exactly what this debate is about! Neither side can prove a. evolution or b. a creator 100% That is why my argument is : what is a more plausable explanation for the origin of life.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You've been playing fast and loose with this terminology, and it really has to stop. Evolution is the study of how populations change over time. The theory of evolution has been conclusively proven to be true. Abiogenesis is the study of how life started on this planet. There are no theories yes, just hypothesis. We know evolution is true. We know life started somehow, and we're trying to figure out the details. If you want to talk about how populations change, use the term evolution. If you want to talk about the process by which life started, call it by it's proper term, abiogenesis. Otherwise you're just adding another layer of confusion to the discussion. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I was referring to evolution. You think it is fact and I don't think it is fact. In your own words and what I was laughing at : still hilarious. closer to a fact does not make a fact. What don't you get about that? I think I've already asked you that. Don't you see? Listen to what trebor said : But hey, you think evolution is a fact, er I mean almost a fact ( )? I have tried to keep this to one argument, but with the billions and billions of species in the world, you should be able to show me at least many many, but for now if you can show me just one scenario where the links take us from one species completely to another, I'd be happy to look at it and comment.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Sigh. We, and by we I mean anyone who knows anything about the science of evolution, understand that the theory of evolution is 99.999% likely to be correct. The. 001% basically is to allow for something utterly bizzare to appear out of nowhere and discount it. Based on that I'd call evolution a fact. What would you call it? We have the fossil record that goes from modern horses back to something that resembles a dog. Multiple examples are spelled out in the book " The Beak of the Finch ". We have genetically determined that the whale's closest land based relative is the hippo. And of course people have taken boars and turned them into pigs, wolves into dogs, and wild fowl into chickens. These are just the easy ones. There are literally millions of examples in the literature. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>LOL. Isn't that a little like me saying God exists because creationists say so? If there are so many examples in literture, please point me in the right direction. I'm not really interested in micro evolution. We all know that that is a fact. So, no whales growing legs. What I want to see is just ONE example of one species turning into another. No matter how many times you say it is so, it doesn't make it so. You need to start backing up your assertation.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Of course not. Scientists base their statements on observable facts and reasoning, which you can check up on. There's nothing similar backing up creationists claims. I just gave you several. Do you literally mean that you only want one? Fine. We have a fossil record showing a dog sized animal changing over time into the modern horse. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>No, no, lol. Again, please provide the proof. I keep getting knocked because I'm not providing proof of a creator ( when all I'm actually trying to do is prove that a creator is a plausable theory ) You need to be able to back up your claims with a reputuable source. If this is true, there should be any of number of websites and books dedicated to it. Please advise where to find this information.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Seriously? I though this was common knowledge. Ok, here's a site with good photos of the fossils, showing the change over the course of 55 million years. http://chem.tufts.edu/science/evolut...eEvolution.htm If you don't think that this constitutes proof then please spell out, as exactly as you can, where you think the holes are. I have no idea what your educational background is, but there are clearly things that I think are common knowledge that you haven't heard, so I really don't know how much detail you need to be able to follow this. BTW, since you keep claiming that your discussion isn't about evolution at all, I'll have no objections to your dropping this thread, if it'll give you the time to state what you position actually is on ID. If you have stated when and how this design was supposed to have happened I must have missed it. I'm much more interested in hearing about that than trying to explain evolution to you.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>well so has anyone decided whos right?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I'm just waiting for you to show your source for the " odds " you quote, then I can prove to you that they're wrong. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>what if theyre not wrong<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If they're not wrong then I'll conceed that ID might have a point. Now when I show you why they're wrong will you at least acknowledge that they're wrong? And will you actually give a source, instead of dodging? It's time to make bread or get out of the kitchen. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>ok but thats when you prove that theyre wrong.. which is.... NEVER! i really dont care what you say becaause i know in the end i will be right. until then its our jobs as christians to make sure that everyone knows the truth.. then our consciences will be clear. oh and you forgot the yeast.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So you care more about dogma than truth. You care more about blowing your own horn than backing up what you say. Your failure to even attempt to back up what you say is simply convincing more people that what you say has no basis. If you're trying to show people " the truth " you are in fact having the opposite effect. You're not demonstrating the " truth " of your position, your demonstrating the weakness of it.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No, no, lol. Again, please provide the proof. I keep getting knocked because I'm not providing proof of a creator ( when all I'm actually trying to do is prove that a creator is a plausable theory ) You need to be able to back up your claims with a reputuable source. If this is true, there should be any of number of websites and books dedicated to it. Please advise where to find this information.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I don't understand. When I gave you links, you whined about my giving links and not discussing the informatin. Now, you want links. Why are you playing it both ways? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Don't be ridiculous. When you gave me links you didn't say anything, just there go check out these links. Whatever. Next time I watch a debate on TV i'll pay close attetion to see if they just direct each other to other sources to go and check out what they say they are argueing for. AND if they then don't back up there argument w / any credable sources. Give me a break already.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You ask for links, you reject links, I don't know what you want. However, you have NOT done one thing you claimed you were going to do. You claims you were going to show it wsa more logical that there was an intelligent designer than abiogenesis. YOu have not addressed that subject all. All you have done is attempt to attack what we know about abiogensis.. You don't seem to have any supporting evidence FOR your point of view. So, tell me, why is it more logical to postulate an intelligent designer ( which you claim that nature of which is irrelavent, and you have provided no evidence for ), rather than accept we don't know everything about how life could have formed naturally? Even if all your critizisms were true ( which they are not ), nothing you have done has attempted to answer that question. That is what your original claim that you were going to do was. When are you going to address that subject? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I did, but you conveniently ignore what I say that you can't answer. You can't get to B if you don't first have A. See? I said that this was a debate of science vs. science. And before my original intended argument turns into evolution, which is irrelevant, I really would like to get back to this. I expected you to at least move on to self ordering tendencies w / my argument against amino acids and protiens being able to organize themselves, but you haven't. Why haven't we gotten into the guts of what a cell is really comprised of and why do you refuse to discuss this self organization? I suggest that is because you know you must take a great leap of faith. Your very refusal to discuss these things is evidence that we should at least consider intelligent design.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Let's see.. We gave you lots of answers. You reject it. YOu insist on more information, you move the goal posts. You have not discuess ' ID ' at all when it comes to the origin of life. I suggest you aren't discussing ID because you have nothing to say about it. I suggest you reject the information provided, because it threatens you. I suggest that it doesn't matter, because at the essence of your claim is that ' An intelligent designer is more logical than natural process as the origin of life ' " makes the knowledge, ( or lack there of ) irrelavent. You made a claim for the logic, you fail to address that issue.. Untill you act with a little more honesty, I am not going to sucked into your lies.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Here are some embarrassments that evolutionaries have had to gloss-over... Archaeoraptor http://www.dinohunters.com/History/Microraptor.htm<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Mont, I grow weary of dealing with this creationist strawman about the way in which Archaeoraptor was received by the scientific community, and subsequent rejection of the taxon as invalid. I will explain the situation to you one last time. " Archaeoraptor liaoningensis " was presented without formal description in peer reviewed literature as a nomen nudum, in a 1999 National Geographic article. The article was mainly a photo-shoot, and explicity denied being a rigorous treatment following the protocol of the ICZN. It was during this nebulous period that the paleontological community, upon further review, demonstrated that " Archaeoraptor " was a chimera, and therefore the taxon was invalid. Note that not only had the scientific community left the taxon as a nomen nudum, but furthermore, the very evolutionary biologists supposedly promulgating " Archaeoraptor " as sine qua non proof of theropod origin, and NOT creationists, who exposed " Archaeoraptor " as a nomen dubium. Therefore, the entire creationist strawman account of the history of this specimen, so zealously parroted by the likes of Jonathan Sarfati and AIG is quite simply the most specious of distortions. Only in creationist spew, has " Archaeoraptor " ever been so euphorically treated as is claimed. Vindex Urvogel <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Then, don't deal with it. Isn't that simple. There is a lot of arrogance displayed from posters on your side... " I've already dealt with this argument " " I've grown tired of debating this " " You are bothering me " It is rather too centred on self. I am not writing these things directly to annoy YOU or take up YOUR time I'm sorry that YOU would think that my whole reason for arguing is to convince YOU particulary. Sorry, but I don't even know YOU... so if YOU are being bothered, don't read my posts which are quite clearly marked as being authored by " MONTALBAN "... just skip past them. ( This is of course the product of a godless society that allows the individual to be the supreme arbiter of good and evil ; the ultimate authority in the world - self-centred world )<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Not at all, mont. You presented a deliberate lie about the reception and treatment of " Archaeoraptor " on the part of the scientific community. I called you on the distortion by detailing the ' actual ' facts of the " Archaeoraptor " issue ( which makes your assertion that I simply ignored the issue and do not deal with it supremely amusing ). Either retract the claim, or substantiate it, and keep your preaching about godless society and ad hominems borne from refusal to present anything ' but ' strawmen, out of the thread -- as they have no business here. Vindex Urvogel <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Eh? On another thread I think I said quite clearly that it was a fake. I also said I didn't know who presented it as fake... it may have been you that said scientists followed it up, and I accepted this explanation. But, it remains evidence of frauds and fakes, which I am quite happy to include in a list of frauds and fakes. And the people who presented it were evolutionaries, so it is still a valid point to list it here. Even here I said " Of course, some writers will be at pains to point out that evolutionaries un-covered these frauds. " So your argument is that if an evolutionary presents a fake, and it is found out to be a fake by another evolutionary, they cancel each other out, and should never be heard of again? And, you are starting to get agressive. Am I forcing you to read my posts? Perhaps again this is further proof of the arrogance of posters on your side. What happened to ' free speech '?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You presented the case of Archaeoraptor in a long list of other cases which you have claimed were engineered by overzealous scientists seeking to promulgate evolution at the expense of reality. " Archaeoraptor " was a debacle only to the National Geographic, it was never a significant issue to the scientific community, which is accustomed to a nomen nudum turning into a nomen dubium all the time -- it is indeed quite common in paleontology. I furthermore would call to your attention that in a moderated forum, " free speech " is in fact restricted. Individuals using a moderated forum which is based on certain protocols, are not free to say anything they wish. Vindex Urvogel<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Ummm, about 100 x the amount of shows which mention atheism. You said organisms weren't born that were slightly different yet the same. That was incorrect. So? In your religion's view, everyone sins. Their sin is no greater or more unforgiveable than yours. Kinda hard, since I'm male. Ok, I'm letting you know. http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html The 3rd gen organisms wouldn't necessarily have the new trait ( it could be recessive ), but the gene would propogate.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Name one. BTW, nobody mentions atheism... they just don't give God credit for anything. Aaaahhhhh!!!!!!! None of you seem to understand my meaning ( or you don't read my posts ). Let's skip this example before I go crazy. Where in my posts have I said that my sins are " more forgivable " then other peoples? If I don't ask for forgiveness I go to hell. If anyone else doesn't ask for forgiveness they go to hell. Comprendes? When the female you reproduce with has children without tonsils, let me know. How was I supposed to know that you were male? " Crim " doesn't sound like a gender specific screen name to me. Calligirl, on the other hand, is kinda obvious. Source please? Sorry but the link won't work. ( I'm not kidding, it won't work. ) Not if it's a mutation or an acquired trait. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Any of the CBN shows like the 700 Club. Plenty of channels on Sunday mornings. And why should shows be giving god credit for anything? You said all homosexuals were going to hell. Your reason was because homosexual acts were sins. I pointed out that all people sin. Do a google search on the CCR-5 gene mutation. Try this : http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/speciation.html Why wouldn't it?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Oh yeah, like the televangelist shows. :) Come on, get real. Maybe they should give God credit for things because He is omnipotent and omnipresent. Maybe because He created us to love Him and serve Him. Maybe because He has blessed America in so many ways! They go to hell because they do not ask for forgiveness from their sins. Anyone who asks for forgiveness and changes will not go to hell. They do not want to change their sinful ways. ( How many times to I have to repeat myself? ) I'm lazy and debating 3 other people. Why don't you do it for me? I tried the link and it took me to http://www.weeeeeeee.com/ ( I think my computer is having problems. :) ) Ever heard of the " mouse experiment "? This freak scientist cut off the tails of mice and then bred them together. The offspring had normal size tails. He tried this millions ( exagerating ) of times with the same results. Acquired traits cannot be passed down from generation to generation. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You asked for one. I supplied it. If you'd like to present an example of a show being explicitely atheist, please do so. I see no reason why secular shows should be required to mention your mythology. And HOW do you know that homosexuals don't repent? Because I don't feel like copying and pasting articles into a forum when they can be easily accessed online. But for a quick summary : The CCR-5 gene mutation is present in about 15% of caucasians, with 1% having the homogeneous version. These 1% are completely immune. The heterogeneous people possess some immunity. Do a google search for ' observed speciation events '. Those links should be the first two results. That's basically the dumbest experiment I've ever heard. Cutting off a mouse's tail wouldn't affect its DNA, so the offspring would still have tails.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Animal Planet, Discovery Chanel, NOVA, etc. I just gave you three. If they had repented, they wouldn't be homosexuals any longer. Crim : I'm going to have to reply to your other statements later. Gotta go! <br><b>S1:4-  </b>They're explicitely atheist? Wow, I didn't realize those channels had a lot of shows about " hey, there's no god ". Read what I said again. Why not?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Oops, sorry! I was thinking about it and realized that they aren't atheist, they are humanist. ( Or at least they try to be. ) I didn't see the word " secular ". But if they are humanist ( which they try to be ), shouldn't they mention every " god "? I never heard them mentioning God using evolution as a possibility for the existence of man. Because they would not be performing homosexual acts any longer. homosexual : of, relating to, or characterized by a tendency to direct sexual desire toward another of the same sex God takes away wrongful desires. Therefore, someone who was previously " homosexual " would not be considered " homosexual " anymore. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>They're not humanist, they're scientific. So you've never repeated a sin?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Yes, God does take away sinful desires. ( If you ask Him. ) I'm not saying that it doesn't take any work on your part, though. When you have a sinful desire, you allow a thought to become more than just a stray idea. You foster and encourage the thought and it becomes a desire. God takes away the desires, helps you deal with your " stray thoughts ", and shows you how to keep them from becoming desires. That all depends on what your definition of science is. ( Different debate. ) Let's put it this way, if they " repeat their sin " but honestly ask Christ to forgive them and to help them not to repeat it, then they are not " homosexual ". If you are constantly having sex with the same sex and then asking for forgiveness, you are not a true Christian. You are trying to tell me that the desire for the opposite sex is some kind of " accident ". " Well, what if they didn't mean to have sex... " That doesn't work, you have to be truly sorry and then MAKE AN EFFORT to stop. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I disagree. Additionally, there is a difference between being homosexual and committing sodomy.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Would you like to continue this debate in a Religion forum? ( We're sorta getting off topic here. :) )<br><b>S1:1-  </b>While your definitions certainly make sense, Mackers, and have a certain etymological purity about them ; they follow neither the common or historical meanings of the word. Atheism is belief in no god ( no comment on certainty made ), Theism is belief in god ( or gods, as appropriate ), Agnosticism was started by a group of French Intellectuals who basically want to avoid the whole issue, their original position was ' No Knowledge of God Until Death '. They mainained that the question of God's existence or not was unanswerable by the living, and that there was no meaningful discussion to be had from the subject. I consider their position to be nothing more than intellectual cowardice.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>atheist means non-theist. that    s what the A is for. like asexual is the lack of a sex ( non-sexual ). a sexual creature has a sex and an asexual creature has no sex. atheist meaning non-theist would be the origin of the word. would you not agree? Gnosticism is about knowledge not belief. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Atheism is derived from non-theist, but in the specific sense of no belief in any god. Agnosticism does derive from no knowledge, but in the specific sense of ' no knowledge of god before death ' ; which is a statement of belief, not of knowledge. In any case, the meaning of words is defined by their usage not by their etymology.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>well done you got the meaning right this time atheism is the lack of belief in a god ( s ) not " Atheism is belief in no god " - Mr Jack atheism is not a belief but the lack of one. gnosticism is to have knowldge of the existance of god ( for or against ) agnosticism is to have no knowledge of the existance of god. i do not believe in god but i have no knowledge in his non-existence or existence. so i am an Agnostic ( i have no knowledge in gods non-existence or existence ) Atheist ( i do not believe in god ) i agree with you. most atheists use the same meaning of the words as i do. it only seems to be theists that think all atheists just reject the possibility of god. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Nope. Atheism is the belief there is no god. This is logically equivalent to no belief in any god. ( But not specific non-belief applied to a given god ). You can be an Atheist without being certain. An Atheist need not reject the possibility of god, only hold there is not one. In the same way as I do not believe I will win the lottery, but I do not reject the ( tiny ) possibility that I might.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>' i do not belive in god ' is not the same as ' i belive there is no god ' disbelief is not the same as belief you are right an atheist can be an atheist without being certian there isn't a god. but atheism in this case is not a belief but the lack of it. a stong atheist would hold the belief there isn't a god ( s )<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I do not agree that they are ' rare ', but even at that - they do exist. What provided the hypoxic environment and the minerals for the entire height of the standing, unrotted tree?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I'm not aware of an entire tree being fossilized. Usually, it's just a portion of the trunk. It's going on in a reservoir near me, as muck accumulates over trees submerged when a dam produced a lake. In the right conditions, the environment is hypoxic, and not much rotting takes place. If it's not disturbed for a long time, we get petrified trees, usually polystrate, because the process goes on for several periods of time. Say a grove of trees is flooded by some kind of lake-forming event ( landlslide say ) and then over a number of decades, several floods deposit layers of sediment. Eventually, the land changes, dries, and the muck compacts to rock. Standing polystrate tree fossils result. Not very common, but they do exist. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I have heard that explanation b4 and the trouble is that the root balls could not have formed and fossilized at the same level as their neighbors ' stems. If a mudslide came into your area and buried the trunk upto 12 ' you could not expect a root ball to form in the 4 - 10 foot level above original grade. [ That assumes the original trees survived the mudslide and continued to mineralized. ]<br><b> S2:2-  </b>They didn't start the process at the same time. That's why they are polystrate. Sure you could. In fact that can be seen happening. At Mt. St. Helens, many trees near the lake were partially or fully buried. Later, trees grew on the new ground, with root balls higher then trees buried in the first level. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The root ball would start at the same level where the top of its neighbor rotted off. The most you could expect for overlap is the depth of the stump from the crown down. Speaking of Mt. St. Helens, what is the status of those trees in Spirit Lake?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Spirit lake does not now exist there. Many of the trees are deeply buried, some still sticking out of the ash, and others completely covered. As new trees take hold, they grow down into the ash, and overlap with the old trees. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>It will be fun to see how long it takes those things to fossilize. Seems like that was ideal conditions for the process. Interesting article about sand dune fossilization of those crustaceans. Is there a way to tell the difference, between wet and dry fossilization? Has it ever been done in a lab or observed in another setting? This last line makes me wonder if they were saying these things were fossilized in the sand dune but was under the sea for a while : " This could be due to a fall in sea level associated with glacial eustasy in the last ice age. ( author abst. ) " What do you make of it?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>In artificial circumstances, it can move pretty quickly. But it doesn't give you as much detail as more gradual fossilizations. Somewhat. The shape of the grains of sand, for example, are different in wind-blown and water-moved cross-bedding formations. No one's had a few million years of lab time, yet. Even in dunes, there's some water. But normally, the dunes get compacted and then cemented. Over time, there's a very slow migration of mineral particles from one to another, and as these harden, the sand gets cemented together.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Of course it matters. I ended up in this green shirt somehow. You say it wasn't a matter of my choosing. In that case there must have been some other mechanism at work. What is it? To my mind if you can't name a mechanism then it's a substantial hole in your philosophy.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>the only way the guy in china could know for 100% certain that you would choose a green shirt since last week, is if he was the one that made your decision for you. in other words, he would have to control your choice faculties and control your actions. otherwise it would be merely a lucky guess. foreknowledge removes free will <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not at all. Maybe he's got a time travelling psychic power. He can see through my eyes, a week ahead. He has no ability to interfere with my actions, but he knows what I'll see next week. The mechanism isn't important. We're just assuming that this guy knows somehow what shirt I was going to wear. His ability is 100% accurate, I'm unaware of it, and he's exerting no influence on me. If the situation seems less absurd if you substitue " God " for " some guy in China " then feel free to make that substitution. That is where this strated after all.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>a time travelling psychic with the ability to see the future would mean that the future is fixed and predetermination exists. in such a scenario free will does not exist <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You keep saying that. And you seldom take more that two sentences to do so. Please, expand! Like I said, I've thought about this quite a bit. It's going to take more than two words to give me something new to chew on. Why does the fact that someone already knew what my choice was going to be mean I didn't actually choose? Please, use lots and lots of words! Feel free to ramble, I don't mind.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>lol suppose it was knowable in some realm that you were definitely going to wear a green shirt next week tuesday. you have serveral shirts of various colors, all of them equally comfortable and stylish, all of them clean. you usually pick your shirts in no particular order, and you dont wear the same color twice in a row. if you are foreknown to be wearing the green shirt on tuesday, it eliminates the option to wear the green shirt on monday, and it eliminates the option of wearing any other color shirt than green on tuesday. in other words, the option of wearing a not-green shirt on tuesday does not exist. you could not choose, for example, a white shirt on tuesday, because it would make the prediction wrong. seeing the future means that the path of options is already known. each decision you make can only be the decision you were foreseen making. the other options can never be chosen because they are not the ones you were foreseen to choose. events that lead to your decision making are also already foreknown, meaning that the other possible events that could have happened instead of the foreseen one could never possibly happen. in a future where the outcome is foreknown, only one option is choosable : the one that is foreknown. one option = no choice<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Thats not what quantum ambiguity shows.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>References for your claim are?? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Irwin schroedinger. Wave / particle experiments, Albert Einstein, Steven Hawkins. The quantum computer is based on the fact that a particle can exist in more than one state at the same time. Could this be one thing travelling down two paths at once?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It says that it can be ambigiuos to a point. SHow me where the path can be changed once known <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The outcome does change once known in the double slit experiment. When a single photon is observed passing through one of the slits, its state collapses to a point particle. If it is not observed, the photon quanta exibits characteristics akin to a wave. This means that until cause and effect are observed, the outcome will be every possible variation. 1 the photon is emitted from the source. 2 the photon passes through the double slit barrier wich either is or is not detecting wich one of the two slits the photon passes through. 3 the photon arrives at the detector as either a particle if it was observed passing through the slit. Or a wave if it was not. This means that as the photon is manifested in the source its state is affected by the observation that will or will not happen in the future at the double slit barrier. This is an example of a future event effecting the past.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No, the event is not past. If so, that would violate the principles of cause / effect, where the effect has to be later in time than the cause.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Mayabe the reason that God doesnt reveal himself is so that we deep down dont really know for sure, and therefore choose our own path? Mayabe this is a test to find out who is good, and who is bad?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>why would making the good option more apparent mean the choice still doesnt exist? if god were to walk around claiming he was god and doing godly things, do you think there wouldnt be a huge portion of the world that would still choose to reject him? if that were the case, then there should be absolutely no christians in the world today. if the choice of sinful or righteous exists ( and in many minds it does ), then the manifestation of either god or the devil will do very little to change people's freedom of choice. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>If you absolutely knew 100% for sure that god and the devil existed, then you would be absolutely terrified to do anything for fear that it may be something that will damn you to hell. Not knowing for sure has a lot to do with the freedom of choice that god so kindly gave us.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>interesting. would you then say that laws against certain behaviors ( such as murder and rape ) are also restricting free will? i mean, knowing that selling drugs will very likely end you up in jail, yet there are drug dealers all over, and every day they are getting busted. it still doesnt stop those that chose to deal drugs from doing so. so huw much does a known consequence really affect free will? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>That isnt an absolute. There are lots of drug dealers that never get caught. Although, I dont often see anyone try to dive down to the titanic with a snorkel and fins. Even though there isnt a law against that. But I am just pointing out an absolute consequence, wich in this case would be death.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>but even in the cases where there is the absolute consequence of death, such as shooting oneself in the head, it does not prevent people from making that choice. people seem to have no problem knowing the inevitable dire consequences of a decision and still making that decision. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>But they dont know for sure that they are going to not ever be conscious ever again, or if they are going to go to heaven or hell. Thats what I am saying. You have the choice to do whatever you want without knowing for sure what the concequences are. That is what allows for free will. The fact that you dont really know of god is out there, ready to lay the smack down of you **** him off.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>and what i'm saying is that even though the reality of heaven and hell were blatantly apparent to everyone in the world, some people would still choose hell of their own accord. thats just the way it is. there are people brazen and rooted enough in their own preconception and outlook that even i the face of death and destruction they still willingly and deliberately stick to their decision. being certain of the outcome does little to change their minds about their actions<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The Scriptures say that all atheists are going to hell when they die. And it looks like the godless jokers around here ( including Penfold, Trebor, Accipiter, etc. ) will likely be joining them ( unless they repent ). They can't be very smart. John 3:36 ; John 14 : 6 ; Acts 4:12.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>For someone seemingly hellbent on accusing atheists of not understanding any other points of view, it's pretty damn idiotic to threaten us with assertions that we know aren't true. This accomplishes nothing besides giving you the self-satisfaction of touting your religiosity so that you can pat yourself on the back. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>What makes you think they're not true? Jesus arose from the dead. That's one of the most well attested to facts in ancient history, whether you want to casually sweep it under the rug or not. Many skeptics set out to prove the story of Christ to be a fairy tale. None succeeded and a number became believers. You guys are playing with absolute fire. If you're wrong ( and you are ), you're screwed big time. Big time and forever. Do you feel lucky? Well, do you?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Reason. Evidence. Need me to look up those words for you? No he didn't, and no it's not. The source of the information is itself inconsistent. You might recall that I posted Ralph Nielson's challenge to recount all of the information in one coherent narrative with no contradictions. Nobody even tried. Bullspit. The alleged evidence for it in the first place is terribly insufficient. The burden of proof is not upon the skeptics. Pascal's wager. A failure for multiple reasons. See a non-exhaustive list here. Note that Easy's post is in response to my pointing out how stupid it is to make an argument that already assumes he's correct. In this post, he uses Pascal's wager, which argues based on a consequence that Easy is correct. About the same as always. Read a fundy's dumbass argument, point out how idiotic it is, make said fundy look like a dipstick. Ho-hum. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You shouldn't make fun of Penfold, the liberal fundy.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It takes a complete dolt to see my quoting you, my responding to your question, and Penfold's responding to me to think that I'm responding to Penfold. You have some severe reading comprehension problems. No, I really don't. Why can't you seem to comprehend this? It's not. You'll hear from me again tomorrow. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Your lips are moving again. So we know a load of horse dung is being vented. You're not guaranteed tomorrow, preppie. You might just wind up in the Pit by nightfall so I recommend that first you repent of your stiff-necked rebellion against God.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Yes sir, O Believer o ' Nonsense. Yet I'm guaranteed not to go to hell. Again, you'll hear from me tomorrow. Start thinking of something more original now. Maybe you'll come up with something only slightly less pathetic in 24 hours.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You waste your time steeeeve, he will never accept that the NT is a continuation of the OT and that Jesus is the Jewish Messiah who fulfilled the OT prophecies of His promised coming.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Possibly because it is complete and utter BS. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You speak as if your statement is one of fact and not a belief on your part based on your spiritual blindness. The best you can hope for is to say that as far as you know it is utter BS. The FACT is though that you are in for a rude awakening when you learn one day that the bible and all that it contains represents Gods word for humanity.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>What can I say apart from... You speak as if your statement is one of fact and not a belief on your part based on your spiritual blindness.... Touche. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Then we shall see when we get to the other side of the veil smiley, until then I'm wasting my time attempting to reason with you.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>At least we can agree on something. You are wasting your time.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>If you mean that a species is transitional, because it is itself in transition, that is, evolving, then you are not dealing with the word as most evolutionaries use it. They mean that it suggests that it has characteristics of more than one type. The problem with evolutionaries and words is that the mis-use them so often. Another is ancestoral. This suggests something that began current generations, but in evolutionary circles it need not have spawned anything, and might have been a dead-end in evolutionary history. It would be better if they used the word archaic.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>More likely we're the ones who are using it correctly. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Who's ' we '? Are you one of the evolutionaries too? What is the correct usage for ' ancestoral ' in the term ' ancestoral type '?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>There is no such term as ancestoral. What you mean is ancestral. Inherited or inheritable by established rules of descent. This is how it is used. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Hey - well spotted spelling error. Are you saying that an ancestral type has to be an ancestor ; that is, actually spawning other species?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are still not getting it.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It dictates, but it doesn't actual prove that you have a so-called soul. In other words " Don't question, believe ". That isn't the function of evolution either. You're belief is incorrect. You only base that on belief, I base it on facts. " Tradition without truth is but an old error. "<br><b> S2:1-  </b>When someone has a belief that can    t be proved or disproved, that belief is as valid as the next. Therefore saying that belief is incorrect because it doesn't fit the facts is just as incorrect. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Hardly. Believing that the Earth is flat and the sun goes around it doesn't make it so. Beliefs based on facts and reality are far more valid than those based on nothing more than wishful thinking. They are speculation only.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I said beliefs that can not be proved. You can prove the earth is not flat and the evidence shows convincingly that the earth goes around the sun. Deeph was talking about his belief that mankind has souls which was what you replied was incorrect, and that you can    t prove or disprove. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If it were that easy than why is there still a Flat Earth Society? :) Why not? We can show that a mind exists. Everything that exists can be measured in one way or another. Energy is energy.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Don't be Montying around. What makes you think everything that exist has energy? Maybe just everything we know about has energy. Okay well I'm open, prove there is no soul. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Even the so-called immaterial has an energy signature. First, prove that we do have a soul. Don't act like a theist and try to shift the burden of proof.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Okay show me how you know that everything that is not material has an energy signature. I am a theist, why shouldn't I act like one? But you were the one that said Deeph's belief about humans having a soul was incorrect and that you were basing yours on facts. You made the assertion that you had the facts and I'm asking you to back it up with the facts you mentioned. Deeph admited that it can't be proved, you are implying that it can. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Energy is " immaterial ". Stick your finger in a live socket and find out. :) In that caes you are acting like one and thus are trying to shift the burden of proof. In all of this time no one has ever found the so-called soul, and it wasn't from a lack of trying either. Along the way were have learned much of the body and mind instead, but still no soul. Say that you had your mind recorded and one day you are killed and they grow you are new body, and then download your mind into it. Would you still have a soul? If they made other copies would they to have your soul?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I was under the understanding that Einstein proved that energy was just another form of matter. No I was requesting proof of your statement, not shifting any burden of proof. Deeph had already stated he had no proof. You stated that you had the facts. Well no one has ever found the explanation for biogenesis either although it    s not from a lack of trying. Does that mean it never happened? There are lots of things that man finds every century. How does not finding something prove there is not that something? Besides how do you find something that is supernatural with natural means? I never said the soul was tied to the mind. Different people have different beliefs about a soul or lack of. I happen to believe that it is a part of God in us. I don    t know how it    works    and is therefore a mystery to me. But I still believe it. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Didn't say that it wasn't. Engergy and matter are basically the same thing. All have an energy signature of somekind and can be measured. You're the one who is making an extra-ordinary claim. The existence of a soul. How is unknown, but it is easy enough to see the results. Where do I look to see a soul? They've been looking for centuries, even thousands of years and nothing. Prove that the supernatural exists in the first place. All that exists is part of nature. You think that nature is only to do with the wild. Nature : 2. A causal agent creating and controlling things in the universe If you believe in the supernatural than you must also believe in everything said to be supernatural since by your definition you can't disprove, or prove it. So ghosts, werewolves, vampires, and other supernatural things that go bump in the night must exist as well. If it is a part of god in us than how can we sin if we're a part of god?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>This should be easy for you students of evolution. How did a lizard evolve an avian lung? http://www.biology.eku.edu/RITCHISO/...spiration.html [ / B]<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yep it is easy. Lizards didn't evolve an avian lung. This should be easy for the creationist : The avian lung is far more efficient than the mammalian lung. Why didn't your god therefore fit the superior lung design to mammals, especially that apparent " special creation ", us humans? Also please explain why he fitted a superior eye design to squid and octupuses than what he fitted to all vertibrates. Once you have answered these two easy questions, I've a few hundred more for you :p <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Only an atheist is arrogant enough to presume to question why God decided to do that. The greatest scientist in history said about the order of the universe : The Author of the system must have found it convenient. Birds did not evolve one either. They were created with it up an running.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Kudos to athiests then. That's your answer is it : you believe your god just bodged together life in a convenient fashion rather than doing a proper job? What a lazy-arsed god you believe in. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Sir Issac Newton was an idiot and you are a genius? Hmm. Let me think about that for a second? Your god does not exist and therfore did nothing. My God only had to speak.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You really think so? Im flattered, but I think you are wrong.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>thats where i partially disagree with you, Xcal. there are plenty of good evolutionists, evolutionists who teach evolution, who fight against creationism, who do research, who help the theory along... who also believe in a God. is this hypocritical? i think so, on the religious side. but i really cannot complain, these people are excellent scientists and evolutionists - among the best we have. their contributions to science far outweigh their mere hypocrisy of a religious belief.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yeah we kind of disagree on this a bit, but that's ok. I understand where you're coming from, I just don't see it that way. Like you said, the purpose of science is to explain mysteries. Evolution is one of those mysteries and there are religious Scientists who have done great work in the field. But for me the real mystery is the Origin of Life. As long as religion stands in the way I personally don't believe we will ever really know, we may not either way. A religious person may now believe in evolution, and they may even speak out against Creationism, but they still believe there is an imaginary being in the sky watching over us as we move through life. Many of those same " Scientists " when asked where they came from will still say " GOD "... So they are not really scientists in my opinion. And then there is the faction that have jumped on board with Evolution so they can mix with the reality of the world. I think that they honestly believe this will help them one day push " God " back into our schools. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>well, a scientist shouldnt be accredited as a scientist based on his / her beliefs that have nothing to do with their work, no? they cant substantiate God, and since science requires substantiation, their belief in God is unscientific, and therefore they believe in something that is unscientific, which is not very scientific of them, yes, and thats where i see the hypocricy in their beliefs. but their beliefs apart from science dont affect their scientific credentials. would you call a believer in God with a Ph. D in biology from Harvard, now a professor of biology at Harvard not really a scientist? i wouldnt.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I wouldn't either, but I would question his ability to think rationally. So what you're saying is that in order to do his Job he would have to think like a scientist while at work, but when he gets off work he can " Dumb " himself down a bit to go back to irrational thought?.. I just don't see how Science and religion can exist in one mind. They are complete opposites. but that's my opinion, I will admit I am a bit Biased because of my feelings about organized religion.... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>now that, we can agree on. however, you have to think, when were talking about science vs religion, we arent talking about every religious person, were talking about those religious people who attack science and try to resort the world to religious dogma. a person who is religious but doesnt attack science in any way - may even be pro-science - is not affecting the situation at all. we're after the fundies. whether youre against religion as a whole, which i certainly am as well, is a different matter.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You mean there are religious people who Don't attack Science?.... Damn I should get out more.. lol.. Bro, I live in the Middle of the Bible Belt, where George W. was The second coming of GOD and Mike Huckabee was a preacher before he got into politics.. I don't know a religious Scientist. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>to Canada with you!<br><b>S1:1-  </b>In a way. I do believe scientists are sincere in their search for knowledge, but there is so much in the effort of finding things just to try to deny God. Yes, there are many people thrown out of their positions or denied tenure if they teach I.D. (. ) I encourage you to watch the movie " Expelled " that Ben Stein made, even if it is only to see the people who have been fired for their beliefs.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That's an idiotic assertion. How can a search for knowledge be an effort to deny your petty god? What would be the purpose of searching for knowledge that denies your petty god? Ben Stein lied to you. Those people in Stein's movie weren't fired because of their beliefs. They were fired because they refused to do the job that they were hired to do, or they were incompetent. Take for example, William Dembski, who was let go by Baylor University ( a Baptist affiliated university ) because he didn't do what he was hired to do. I notice that you don't support your assertion with examples. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>This is the kind of person I was talking about. ( Thanks for proving my point Data ). I know what you mean, my parents told me Harry Potter was evil because of the witchcraft, then my dad saw one of the movies and loved it so much we own all of them and we read all the books. But as Data has shown, there are those who use " science " so they can deny God. Most of the science that does this is unbased while most other facets of science show His glory even without mentioning Him. They were hired to teach a class, not to teach evolution.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Apparently you didn't notice that he didn't say that he was searching for ways to deny your god. He said that he took pleasure when the results debunked the wholly babble and creationism. Again, that's not what he said. Personally, when I was doing science there never was any intent to deny your petty god. However, it was always funny when creationists squealed at the results of science. What a load of nonsense. So science can show the glory of a mythical being without mentioning him, and it can also debunk the existence of that mythical being, also without mentioning him. You're so logical. And they were fired for not teaching that class. I personally know of an English teacher who taught creationism in his English classes. He was let go. Of course, only an XXXXX would try to teach that the earth is only 6,000 years old in a earth science class. It takes intentional ignorance to deny evolution. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The only thing is that they don't debunk creationism. So to take pleasure in something that looks like it might, is to have been searching for it in the first place. I just don't like " theories " that are mere speculation to be taken and taught as fact. No, I meant without a base. It takes ignorance to deny something that has no proof?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Now you're just trying to be funny. Yep. You're just trying to be funny. Thank god that scientific theories are not just mere speculation. Ever hear of the theory of gravity? I know. You're going to display your profound ignorance of scientific topics by telling us that " gravity is a law. " Wrong again. Newton formulated the first theory of gravity that was based on a consistant observation. The observation is the law and the theory explains why. Same with evolution. The theories are explanations of observations of evolution. On the other hand, there are no observations or explanations of " creation. " Just immaginings based on the mythology of nomadic, bronze age herdsmen. Then, by saying " unbased " you actually meant to talk gibberish. In fact, the theories of evolution are based on observations of changes the genetic makeup of populations of living things. You display yet more ignorance of what science is and how it works. Of course, there isn't even a hint of evidence of creationism. It's pretty silly to fall back on magic for anything that you don't understand. To believe in young earth creationism means that one must deny physics, geology, astrophysics, astronomy, biology - in fact, all of science but elementry chemistry. Wow! Talk about ignorance.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>IC is to ID as natural selection is to evolution. you cant argue for IC and then turn around and say you refuse to argue for ID. IC is a tool used by ID advocates to make ID " work " ( even though its rather a lack of something happening. )<br><b> S2:1-  </b>IC is to ID as natural selection is to fuel intake valves. I just did. Lol Ah if only you could use propaganda analogies to win debates how utterly destroyed would be my arguments by the brilliant British humor... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>i just facepalmed so hard, my face went right through! read that again, freedie. i dont think you quite understand the concept of the analogy prose " __ is to __ as __ is to __ " then again, it is apparent from your arguments that you dont know a shread about the topic at hand - maybe you dont know anything about fuel intake valves either. no need.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You shouldn't do that, it doesn't sound healthy :p You were attempting to indicate that IC is integral to any comprehensive theory of intelligent design. I responded in the same form indicating that this is not true, that IC has nothing at all to do with any theory of ID and is in fact totally limited by it's own terms and subject to evolution. Desire at least. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>disagree. the term " irriducible complexity " is constantly used in ID circles by all ID advocates. youll never find an ID advocate that doesnt use IC to defend their position. in fact, IC is the #1 objective argument for ID advocates. i would hesitate to call what you seem to be calling " irriducible complexity " if you refer it to being an evolutionary tool ; i would call your argument " ridiculous ". what you are guessing evolution does is so improbable, is not recognized by any geneticist, and is a really huge leap in the genome - which is greatly frowned at and rejected by our knowledge of genetics, that i find my new term specifically designed for you to be quite adequate. your argument is a massive appeal to odds. if you are prepared to call what you argue for " irriducible complexity " i would suggest readying yourself to defend ID, because it is the engine of ID. no need to use comedy to defeat your arguments - words will do, its quite easy enough.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I do not care, so is Darwin's name ; that must mean Darwin is an integral part of ID. You're kidding right? The ID movement predates Behes book by a decade at least. Furthermore you cannot support ID with IC.. lol Blurting an assertion along with several other assertions does not support the first bennedict. I understood you the first time. ROFL, you realize those two paragraphs are contradictory to each other right? 1. He has never supported any creationism 2. He is obviously a creationist You basically admitted that the standard by which you identify creationist is ' those who deny evolution '. BTW I never choose Christianity, if ever being a christian is a measure of a creationist then Darwin was one. Than how can anyone know that I am a creationist? Find and example. You are probably having trouble using words precisely and have mistake two similar statements for two identical statements. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>sigh. Darwin's name is used by ID advocates as an attack on evolution, never to support their own " theory ". you have to think a bit harder before answering and throwing up strawmen. like i said, IC is used by ID advocates, and to satisfy your endless crave for absolute straight answers without the need for implications that seeminly anyone apart from you can catch up on, ID advocates use IC to support their idea. you cant escape what's true. ID advocates use IC as their main argument in support of their " theory ". observe any ID advocate and youll hear " ____ is so complex, it couldnt have evolved through a gradual process. " i cant believe im having to catch you up on this... despite the fact that Behe is an advocate of intelligent design... and he came up with IC to support ID. well done, freedie. you seem flustered, freedom. are you flustered?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No ' this all ' is because some people would rather play the part of foolish partisan rather than admit the simplest thing. In case you forgot, ' this all ' started when it was claimed that I must be a creationist because espouse IC. ' this all ' is about whether or not that is the case. The only way that could be the case is if IC forced via logic any who accept it to the conclusion of creationism. Which means the crucial premise that will decide ' all this ' is whether or not one can support ID with IC. and my claim was that it cannot be. lol<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So what you're saying is that Behe, as well as all the others who use IC to support ID got it wrong?.. I found this interesting.. Even the Courts disagree with you.. lol.. Note the part where he says that IC is CENTRAL to ID... Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District I personally don't know, I don't care... the Term IC refers to Creationism whether it can proven or not, the leading ID'ers consistently try to use IC to support their position. If you disagree I suggest you take it up with the ones who came up with the term to begin with. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I can't help but giggle because no matter how many times I say the same thing it never sinks in. IDrs think that defeating evolution supports ID. They got that wrong. IDrs and ICers think that IC defeats evolution. They got that right. However ; no sane person claims to go from IC to ID directly, they would have to be tottally ignorant of what IC is. Be it a single feverish fool in a funny farm or the whole world crying against it, logic has no equal. Ah the death knell of all arguments ' it is so whether it can be proven or not '. I would be taking it up with ken millar and dawkins too if they were members of political debate forums. Regardless the burden of proof still lies with the affirmative position. I have not held you to greater than that ' you cannot argue for IC without supporting ID ' = > ' IC supports ID ' = > ' IC can support ID '. What are you talking about?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>First of all why not call them what they are.. ID'ers = Creationists. Anything a Creationist finds that can defeat evolution he / she will claim that it supports their belief. You say that IC defeats Evolution and that they got that right, So that means if Evolution is not possible then Creation is the only other explanation for life. Which in turn means that If IC can defeat Evolution then it MUST support Intelligent design. Intelligent Design = Creation, you can't really believe there is any difference. So if you believe in your own mind that IC defeats Evolution, as you imply in the above quote, then IC does in fact support ID.. which is Really just another way to say Creation. So are you a creationist or an Evolutionist? you can spin it however you like but you can only be one or the other, there is no in between. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>All creationist are IDrs but not all IDrs are creationist. I know. Really, how do you propose to support that dichotomy? Why? The choice between two wrongs should not be made.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are Wrong, Intelligent Design implies a creator, whether that be some alien being or a supernatural invisible man it implies a Creator. Creationists came up with the term intelligent design in an attempt to introduce creation into the realm of science so they could in effect teach " Creation " in schools. You can make your claim until you're blue but it doesn't change reality. I don't have to. When discussing the subject of Life and how it exists we are left with two options. We either evolved as evolutionists believe or we were created by some higher being. Play your little word games if you want, it doesn't change this fact either. You're either a Creationist or an Evolutionist, there is no in between. So you are saying that both Evolution and Creation are wrong? I would love to hear your explanation of Life without involving either a creator or Evolution.. And before you go trying to use IC as a stand alone explanation for life don't bother. Anyone with half a brain knows that IC is not a stand alone explanation. you're just being ridiculous and twisting words to fit your position, but the facts are obvious.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Well, I was just giving a different perspective from a witness who was also there, so obviously not everyone sees the events the same way. The thing is though, if they were booting people for being biased against the movie, or because they would object to it's message, it stands to reason they wouldn't have let anyone in PZ Myer's party in as well. And do you seriously think that if Richard Dawkins ' name was registered on the website they wouldn't have noticed that? I find that pretty hard to believe. It stands to reason there were other perhaps un-related reasons Myers was booted than his objections to the content of the movie. Furthermore, if the producer deliberately started a discussion, then it only further stands to reason he didn't mind opposing viewpoints toward the movie.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Of course. The makers of Expelled were within their right to expel the very same people that they were attempting to demean in the film. It's perfectly legal, but it was also a rude, hypocritical, and stupid PR move that is rightfully being criticized. Certainly... just like how the makers of Expelled have repeatedly refused to publish the interviews in full. It's not just that PZ and Dawkins object to the content of the movie -- the makers of Expelled don't want them to be able to object in the first place. It's always been their favorite argument against PZ to dangle over the head of his criticisms the fact that he hasn't even seen the movie. They can't pull that one on Dawkins anymore, which is to their disadvantage, but fortunately they managed to spot PZ before it was too late. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Again, maybe there were private reasons for him being " expelled " that had nothing to do with Myers views about evolution or the movie. They let Dawkins in and Myers ' party, as well as initiated discussion at the end ( according to your own statements ) so obviously they weren't against having other views expressed there. Something's iffy here -- it doesn't add up. It makes more sense there were private and unrelated reasons he was not allowed in.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Private, definitely. Unrelated, absolutely not. PZ once called in to a radio show that was talking with Mathis, and by the end of the show, Mathis was so infuriated and desperate that he screamed, " Go to his website! Myers is an atheist! He's an atheist! " Of particular irony is that during the show, Mathis claimed PZ ridicules students for their religious beliefs in his biology class ( which, if I may say as one of his students, is not true ), and then Mathis goes on to ridicule PZ for his. Mathis hates PZ on a very private level. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If that blog is any indication, looks like there's a serious personal thing between BOTH these guys. Anyone who says he proud to be a " militant atheist " has issues -- if they're out to intentionally OPPOSE religion rather than simply hold to their views, then they are no better than the Pat Robertsons or Jerry Falwells of religion. Atheism shouldn't be an aggressive force out to oppose something. After all, we've been told here time and time again that it's an " ism ", merely a lack of belief in God. Frankly this looks like two fundies from two very different views having it out, and putting on a big show while they're at it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So, you wouldn't describe yourself as opposed to Islam's treatment of women? You simply hold your views on this subject? Sorry, but nothing says people who don't have a religion can't oppose religion. It's also important to remember that " militant atheists " like Dawkins and Myers aren't opposed to people having religion. What they are opposed to is creationism and the intelligent design movement, the religious indoctrination of children, the attempt to subvert the separation of church and state, and the amazing amount of violence that comes about as a result of religious conflict. Being opposed to those things is not something someone should be proud of? Well, whatever floats your boat...<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I can't tell the future. I can tell what is accurate and what is inaccurate. I think we should do our best to have schools teach our kids what is accurate science in science class.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So you think the wrong process was used to determine what should be taught in schools? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I didn't use the words " wrong process ". I am not sure what you mean.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You said this ; Do you think " what is accurate " is so cut and dried that school boards and voters shouldn't determine it? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>When it comes to science, no they shouldn't, without question. I would not want a school board to determine a medical procedure to be performed on me, either like they tried in the Terry Schivo case.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Then you don't believe in the U.S. political system - that's the point I'm trying to make. ( US taxpayer funded school decisions isn't comparable to personal medical cases ) A school board didn't attempt to make a decision in the Schivo case. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Medicine is a science. I do not want non-scientific theories or erroneous information taught to people who may end up being my children    s doctor. You see, doctors study science. ID is not a valid scientific theory. I want the doctor    s who will care for my kids and grandkids to get proper scientific educations, not flawed ones. How can I say that? Because no proponent of ID can name one scientist who has demonstrated that ID is a valid scientific theory. That    s how.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You want doctors for your kids who believe that life has no meaning - if it feels good, do it? Or a doctor with Christian values? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I want a doctor who will make them better. That's why I take them to a doctor instead of a rabbi, minister, priest or shaman. Why do you go to a doctor?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Knowledge is a small part of who a person is, and what kind of a job he'll do. The job he does will also be determined by his motivations and goals. If he feels accountable only to man, he knows he can do things that can go undetected by man. If he feels acountable to God, he believes nothing he does goes undetected by God. Suppose your six year old is in the hospital needing serious, but not life threatening foot surgury. Down the hall is another six year old who needs a heart transplant, and has very rich parents. Word is discreetly getting around that the first doctor that comes up with a healthy 6 year old heart will never have to work again. Do you want a doctor who is only worried about accountability to man eyeing your childs chest? " We're sorry, but your child DIED during surgury, and I have malpractice insurance. " Now I know it's not really that way, doctors C A R E about their patients. Yeah right, just like the auto parts man cares about the fenders and doors on all his cars. The doctor who believes everything happens by chance, is going to be more ethical than a doctor who believes in the Christian belief of purpose?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Wait, so you're going to tell me what the private message that the admin sent me stated? You're absolutely delusional, aren't you Archie? You just invent your own reality to suit your own preconceptions, and you are so far gone that you aren't even aware of it.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I'm telling you what it meant, since you either aren't smart enough to figure it out or i'm saying that you're a liar. Take that any way you want to. Since I could post a hundred examples of you and your cohorts misinterpreting what I have clearly stated, so why should I accept this interpretation of yours of what you claim admin said when I have brought the issue up to him personally? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Just so we're clear here Archie : I'm too stupid to understand, or lying about the meaning of, a private message that you have never seen, and have therefore taken it upon yourself to interpret what this private message, that you have never seen and can therefore have no idea of the contents, actually means. Does that about sum it up correctly? You know, you keep accusing everyone around here of dishonesty, or misinterpretation. Did you ever consider that the problem might be you? We have a whole forum here for you to prove your accusations of my dishonesty. You have yet to do it. Odd, since I'm such a prolific liar.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Talks cheap tq, but I don't see you proving your claim with any evidence. Got any proof? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>This in no way answers my question. However, I've forwarded you the PM from admin. If you'd like, feel free to post it for everyone and explain it to us all.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Let admin PM me and take credit for writing it. Unfortunately you have no credibility with me so I don't know who actually wrote that. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Boggles the mind. The pair you must have. You should bronze those suckers.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>That's ridiculous, I happen to still be very attached to them.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Really? You consider rebelling against your heavenly father growing up? I call it denying ones birthright. Rom 8:13 For if you live according to the flesh you will die ; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. Rom 8:14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. Rom 8:15 For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, " Abba, Father. " Rom 8:16 The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, Rom 8:17 and if children, then heirs -- heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with [ Him ], that we may also be glorified together.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Er... how can you rebel against something that does not exist? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>If God be a myth then you would have a valid point. But since you are the product of His existence, then your claim is a total denial of reality. And unfortunately this will be the result for you. Mat 10:32 " Therefore whoever confesses Me before men, him I will also confess before My Father who is in heaven. Mat 10:33 But whoever denies Me before men, him I will also deny before My Father who is in heaven.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Goody! I made a valid point. It is you who are in total denial of reality. Oh, and I regard your empty threat with the contempt it fully deserves. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Mock God all you like atheists. None of it changes who He is or the inevitable shock which awaits all who deny His eternal Lordship over all that is. Mat 10:32 " Therefore whoever confesses Me before men, him I will also confess before My Father who is in heaven. Mat 10:33 But whoever denies Me before men, him I will also deny before My Father who is in heaven.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Take offense on behalf of your imaginary god all you like. None of it changes reality, and the inevitable nothing that awaits you. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Where did I say I was offended in any way by your ignorance smiley? It is God you are offending and God who will deal with you at the judgment. He doesn't need me defending Him from God denying atheists.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Taking offense is what you do. Your god does not exist, so he / she / it is incapable of doing so. Your last sentence is correct.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You may as well not post cut and paste from the bible because I don    t read it. If you can    t argue in your own words I am not interested.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>My words are as empty and shallow as yours are. But these words from the bible are the meat of life and never come back void. Sure, you can ignore them and insist that they don't have any influence on you, but when all is said and done in this life, they will be all that truly mattered. I also find it interesting that you so fear the TRUTH that you are afraid to even read it. So I repeat. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Your approach assumes we agree that there is a god and that the bible is the word of god, I disagree on both points.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The bible is the word of God and your rejection of that FACT does nothing to negate that reality. Don't you get it yet? You can ignore, deny, reject and turn away from the living God all you want to, but that does nothing to lessen the fact that HE IS THE GOD OF ALL CREATION AND THE LORD OF LIFE. FOR IT IS WRITTEN AND A RELIABLE PROMISE : Phl 2:10 that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, Phl 2:11 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Your argument is a joke as usual. I don    t know what happened to you to make you this way but it must have been terrible.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Jhn 3 : 5 Jesus answered, " I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. Jhn 3 : 6 Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit [ fn ] gives birth to spirit. Jhn 3 : 7 You should not be surprised at my saying, ' You [ fn ] must be born again. '<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Not really. We just didn't report you. And remind me, who is the person calling everyone who disagrees with him a " hatemonger? " Was it you or was it me? Come again? Could you care to show where you disproved a single point made against you? Shall we bring up your hoaxes and the infamous " birds with jet engines coming out of their butts? " And apparently you consider everyone who isn't a radical fundementalist Christian to be " spiritually dead, " nevermind that you can't even prove your God exists much less your religion is correct.... Self declared victory. Always hollow, always shallow, always wrong.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Sorry moose but I don't know what to respond to. Let this liar post my actual post which he mockingly accuses me of saying in these quotes above and I will gladly respond to them. But why should I explain statements I never made? The point I'm making here that you are also apparently to thick to get is that it is childs M.O. to re-interpret what others say and repeat them back to them in ways to make that person not only sound stupid, but insane to believe something so ludicrous. So let this lying punk post me saying that birds need jet engines coming out of their butts in order to fly and I will gladly explain what I meant. I mean, if he sent it to chemist so he could get a good laugh at my expense then surely he can post the exact link of me saying that so we can all get a good laugh together, right? Either that or he owes me an apology. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Moose posted from the link I gave you which shows your quote. He provided what you asked for. How is he wrong in his explanation of what you meant?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Moose didn't post any link at all. Just a line that someone said, allegedly. YOU post the link where I said birds have jets coming out of their butts to fly as you mockingly attributed to me as if I was defending that claim. Put up or shut up child, and don't try to wiggle out of it with your usual scurillous and cowardly techniques. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Wow you are lazy. I provided you the link to the page. Moose provided you the direct quote. What more do you want? Seriously, does Jesus smile upon sheer laziness and sloth? I remember a quote, " idle hands are the devil's playthings " http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...4&postcount=51 Geez, lazy... I already did post the link... you're just lazy.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Where did I say anything about birds not being able to fly without jet propulsion? Now let me show the great flaw in the argument you were attempting to make. On the one hand you insist that Dragons in no way ever existed, yet in your evidence to prove they didn't exist you referred to wing span to mass ratios as evidence that the implication that they could fly is ridiculous. Tell me how that is the least bit rational argument? First you say they couldn't exist then you show how their wing spans weren't in proportion to their bodies to allow for flight. QUESTION... If they never existed, how do you know their wingspans per body proportion? But as usual you make off the wall claims with absolutely nothing to support your moronic and irrational contentions. And you don't even see the contradictions in your ludicrous arguments. And then you proceeded to mock me for my beliefs. Maybe that explains why I walked away in total frustration and unable to deal with you any further.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>montalban, please respond to post 47<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Much as I would like to, it is beyond my limitations to deal in a manner with someone who believes owning a car is a moral issue. I have no way of communicating with you any further on this issue... I have never actually met anyone who would consider such an immoral issue as a moral issue. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>i thought it was glaringly obvious that i saw preference ( you say owning ) of car is NOT a moral issue.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I don't believe ' owning a car is a moral issue '. If you do, I have absolutely no idea of how do discuss this subject with you - such are my many limitations. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>me too    why do you put this in quotes? I    ve never said it, or even implied it. well since i don't, what is the limiting factor on the conversation?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I thought you were the one who raised it as being a moral issue! <br><b>S1:4-  </b>well i didn't... so please respond to 47.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I already said that you've exhausted my mere mental fascilities on this subject ; I've no idea how to brooch the subject of morals and cars.

If you feel it is, then I can't help. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>again, i originally was talking about liking red sports cars, but i hold the same stance. it's an amoral issue. what are you basing this on? i've never said it, or even implied it. and when you tried to paint this opinion on me i've corrected you several times. BUT YOU STILL SAY IT. our record is recorded here on the forum... go back and read what i've said. I DON'T For anyone else    do you understand the analogy between liking red sports cars and atheism?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Obviously not<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Still no evidence from the imbecile Xcaliber backing up his assertion that I defended ID.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>talking to yourself won't help you, Ask your brother EZ, He's tried it too. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Sill waiting for the evidence that I defended ID..............................<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Still waiting for you to Admit you are wrong.... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I am not wrong and you have provided nothing to show otherwise.

It wont work but you can try. As said, put up or shut up<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I didn't run away from anything.. I posted a couple of quotes which you ignored.. You're the one confused as to what you even think.. You still defended ID.. I'll say it again, YOU DEFENDED ID.. a Position you previously did not Defend. There's no shame in that.. just ignorance on your part.. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Prove it or admit you are wrong. Your quotes proved nothing<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Well I'm not wrong, and I have proven it.. Nothing more I can do. :) <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I will give you benefit of the doubt due to the obvious limition of your capacity of comprehension. The assertion that an assumption is reasonable does not assert that the assumption itself is correct. Nowhere in the posts you quoted did I state that ID or even god exists. I even go on to state on both quotes that the assumption would have no scientific value which by any standards is not defending the assumption of ID and even God as correct. There assumption of witches and demons was not unreasonable in the middle ages because they were a reasonable assumption gleaned from the only ' knowledge ' available at the time which was itself a bunch of assertions. There were enough provisos in both posts for it to be obvious that I did not defend ID. Apology accepted :)<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Well I knew before I even posted those quotes that you would claim this.. you still defended ID as being reasonable... lol :) <br><b>S1:7-  </b>I defended the assumption of ID as being reasonable and of course you should know that I claim it.. I posted it more than once. What you WERE confused with was the validity of the assumption as opposed to actuality of what assumed.. not your fault but I indulged you with another of many attempts to educate you... you had the excuse of ignorance then but not now. Posting up quotes and repeating your mistake does not make you right.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>I don't need a little XXXXX like you educating me on anything.. That you should get clear.. You don't need to feel shame for Defending ID, it's not your fault you are delusional. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>That is your delusion.. that you dont need educating. I notice that you called me little.. knowing that you dont actually know how big I am I assume you must be massive... are you fat? I dont think it is unreasonable to assume you are massive due too your assumption that I am small compared to you but that does not mean my assumption is correct. I assume that if you are massive it is probably because you are fat.. this is because most massive people are massive due to being overweight and also it would explain your projected hatred... poor self esteem. However my assumption that you are fat although not unreasonable does not mean that my assumption is correct only that it is not unreasonable to assume it :) That lesson was free<br><b> S2:8-  </b>Only thing you proved is how ignorant you are. <br><b>S1:9-  </b>Translation..

Some such transfers prove to increase fitness - most are neutral or detrimental. Its just another source of genetic variability and thats what selection selects from! Same with endosymbionts ( and one might add even exosymbionts! )..<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Wait. natural selection is supposed to be the creative element in your theory. If bacteria trade specific genes which provide resistnace, the creativity lies right there -- no selection. It would be no different if an organism experienced a nonrandom or adaptive mutation... the mutation would immediately make its host more fit.... which means fitness occurred without selection... it would also mean that the individual evolved and did not need the population to do so. Bacteria swapping genes are no different. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>NDS does not deal with creativity nor does it have a " creative " element. Selection is non-random and its clear why that is so. Genetic changes on the other hand are largely by chance and show no discernable pattern in most instances. This includes gene-transfers, and acquistition of endosymbionts. And think about it my friend, horizontal transfer is not some sort of flea market where the organisms get together and swap genes like a market place. " I'll trade you a resistance gene if you will give me a metal tolerance gene " is NOT what goes on!<br><b> S2:2-  </b>do you deny that bacteria swap specific genes for resistance? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>First of all its not a swap, there are horizontal transfers, but it would be very rare for it to go both ways. Secondly what are transferred are various genetic elements, sometimes very very large numbers of them borne on plasmids. These MAY include resistance genes, but they are cerainly specifically constratined to do so. In other words the exchanges are non-specific.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>From what I understand, bacteria " share " their assets. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Sorry but " share " is a very misleading way of looking at it. Genes are sometimes transferred between species of bacteria. The correct term is horizontal transfer.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>They can if they're Catholics since Evolution is accepted doctrine now in the Church.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What? No, it    s not a doctrine. The Church has ruled that IF Evolution is true, it in no way interferes with our teaching of Creationism. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Wrong, the Pope has stated that evolution is true and he got around the image part by saying that we're made in god's spiritual image instead.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The Pope didn't say it was fact, he most of the theory doesn't contradict with Church teachings as said here. For instance, polygenism is a popular belief among evolutionists, but the Catholic Church stands firm in monogenism. It is debated how the beginning of the universe happened, but the Church did approve Human Evolution. However, it's not a sin or anything to not believe in evolution. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The speech doesn't seem to match the written version in some regards. I did say that it was accepted by the Church.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>YOU said it was church doctrine, which was a lie. We accept evolution, but it isn't doctrine. Many Catholics don't believe evolution - even in the Vatican. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I had said that it was accepted doctrine. I would guss that many also still believe the Earth is flat as well and that the Sun goes around it.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No, that's heresy in one sense. The bible actually does say the world is round, but that's a seperate issue. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>The Earth is not round. A coin is also round and it is flat as well. No matter how high you can go you can not see all of the Earth at once. The Earth is a sphere. ( More or less egg shaped as well ). So, the bible doesn't say that the Earth is a sphere.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>How do you know, when you say you don't know?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I think this is a misunderstanding. But I asked you first and if you will answer I think I can clear up the misunderstanding. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Actually I asked first :) then you asked had I ever met a complete adult. And, I answered this... I said something along the lines that I'd judge them by what I know - but the point is you say a ) that something ' is ' and b ) that you don't know it ' is '.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>How do you know what the people you are judging are doing? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I said that I would make a guess based on what I would be able to tell. I've already stated it before. You said you know and don't know. You didn't say that you assumed that they were good people. You made a categorical statement.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So you're saying you can't know when someone is successful you just take a guess. Is that what you are saying? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>At least I've given you an answer. You've not provided one.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I    m just wondering why when I stated that both my kids were successful, you question how I knew that but you don    t see any problem with you guessing about someone else being successful. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>It was the way you worded it. You made a bold statement, not a cautious one as I suggested I would do. So I wanted to know how you were so sure. Becuase you made a grand statement of both certainty and then you said you were uncertain. Hence you seem confused. I can see what you're hinting at, but you fail simply because of the wording of your original statement. If you wanted to re-write it to a more cautious one, then you'd have a valid point. :) In the same confused way you keep telling me I believe in two gods.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Although I don    t know what either of my kids are doing every minute of the day, based on their jobs, their contribution to society, and their dedication to their families, I judge them to be successful adults. Does that meet with your apparent sensitivity to any kind of absolute statements that are not approved by your church? LOL I think I outlined the analysis in detail pretty well. Besides I wasn    t telling you as you already know it. Well maybe you don    t if you haven    t checked with your church yet. But I was pointing it out to anyone else reading the post. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Perhaps you should check with my church. LOL but it's quite funny for you to describe your reasoning as ' logic '.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Looked pretty logical to me. No one has pointed out where the logic broke down yet. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>I did. You have yet to show a ) the verse from which you refer b ) that it was read the way you have read it. That you have failed to do either ( the second being the most important ) means that you've made an assumption and despite facts to the contrary assume you are right. It is as I said on another post interesting that you've only accused me of believing this two god theory of yours, and no other Christian... even Biblicists... and here's the funny thing... I'm not a believe in sola scriptura, and mentioned this on several posts, but don't let that get in the way... just keep telling me that I've got to believe in something the way you think I should.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>I'm actually suprised you haven't read or at least heard this verse. But I'm not doing your research for you. Even if I told you exactly where it was, you'd just say your church didn't interpret it that way. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>I am not as well versed with Scipture as I should be. But then I am not overly-concentrated on it like the sola scriptura churches are either. Exactly! We don't. So stop telling us that we do!<br><b> S2:8-  </b>Easy, Easy. LOL<br><b>S1:1-  </b>ok Mosh so if you cant give me any evidence that god exists then we can agree there is no evidence that God created anything... let alone the universe. Black holes... gather enough mass together and a black will occur.. even if they dont exist ( and there is enough evidence thaty they do ) they could exist if enough marerial was brought together.. even Newtonian physics predicts this... I will decline to read your theory<br><b> S2:1-  </b>there are thousands... literally.. of phd scientists who would say you just dont know the facts, and that black holes are not in evidence, and could not exist. There is nothing to suggest they exist... only that really heavy things do. there is a difference... - Mosheh Thezion <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You have just proved that you do not even have grasp of Newtonian physics and so you really arent worth debating with.. really heavy things eh?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Picking on my mis-use of the term heavy... is not an argument. let me say... massive. as in lots of mass. if you have something to ague do so. - Mosheh Thezion <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If you dont know the difference between heavy and massive you have even less of a grasp of physics than feared. To keep asking for an argument and continually showing your inability to argue is just making look foolish. I would suggest that you take a little time to study basic physics, please dont say that you know because it is quite obvious that you do not! I decline to argue with you in the same way that I would decline to argue this with a child.. the child may still keep on but you know it really is not worth it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>the fact that i responded with the term ' mass '.. should be enough. but either way... you are not arguing, so it doesnt matter what you say. you can cry and run away if thats what you want to do. - Mosheh Thezion <br><b>S1:4-  </b>As I said.. the child may keep on but you know it is not worth it.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>then stop talking to me, and let me argue with someone who can argue. - Mosheh Thezion<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Mosheh Thezion, how about you present a specific piece of evidence to support creationism and we'll go over it? It's not our jobs as those who do not believe in creationism to prove it.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>the greatest... and most signifigant piece of evidence is the motions of all heavenly bodies.. such as the fact that matter.. is all very organized... such as galaxies.. which are all expanding from a central core in super clusters.. And galaxies... are all spirally... expanding... as stars in orbit.. and that stars... are orbital systems... of planets.. and that all planets are made of atoms... which are spinnning orbital expansions of the same orbital scheme... The fact is... the entire cosmos... is very ordered.... structured... in a specific order... fashion.. and is anything but chaos... That is fact... real evidence... there is nothing random about it. lets start with that. - Mosheh Thezion <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I wasn't aware that physics proves God exists. How does the fact that gravity defines how objects move in space equates to God being the cause of creation?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>gravity does not define.. expanding spiral galaxies. it is completely opposite to big bang... which is why they invented dark matter and dark energy... to justify the impossibility of a big bang condensing cloud formation theory... It is obvious... that it would be to much work, to educate all of you on the sciences, and I should restrict this kind of debate to a science forum... as you people simply do not know the evidence. The fact is... you.. you... can point to any given piece of evidence.. and I can show that it fits in my theory of a dimensional progression. - Mosheh Thezion <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Clearly, you don't understand what a singularity is. Again, how does physics prove God?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>s o.. then... show me evidence for a singularity then.???? show me one black hole, provide evidence, that its a singularity and not mearly a massive black dwarf. Can you do it? can anyone? no... but go ahead and try, because that evidence does not exist. Like I said.. provide evidence... not the conceptual theory derived from the evidence. Evidence.. like the thing at the center of our galaxy... its black... its dense.. and has massive gravity... but thats all we know... and there is nothing proving its a singularity. ( A hole ) Or that singularities ( holes ) can even exist. Believing in holes in space that lead to mysterious unknowns is based on nothing but theory based on imagination... and is not evidence. try again. - Mosheh Thezion
