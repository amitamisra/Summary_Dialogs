You rail against the Mideastern countries for their treatment of Christians and sharia law , but you are so happy to impose that same sharia law upon us . You are just the same as the Islamists that you despise .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>He has not advocated the execution , imprisonment , or even mandatory therapy for homosexuals that is an unfair accusation . It is the homosexual lobby who are trying to force him and people like him to recognize homosexuality in the public sphere and thus condone and support it , and their reaction to that is the sum of the so called ' gay-bashing ' in modern western countries . That is why I could live in peace with easyrider but not a collectivist , he believes in freedom if only because the founders of the united states did . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>He is advocating that his religious beliefs be turned into laws that I have to live under . Yes he is the Taliban . Yes he wants sharia law imposed upon me and my family .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No , you want your relationship imposed upon him and his family . What religious belief is it that he wants as law ? That homosexuals should be put to death and their blood is on them ? He has not advocated that in all the posts he's made since I've been here . You think you have a right to public support and that is why you have a blindness to the nature of what he wants . Homosexual marriages have not been banned by any state , some refuse to recognize them and that is all . You can still sign any contract with anyone you want . You can still have as much sex as you want with whoever you want . There are no oppressive laws and the sooner you realize that the sooner we all can stop hearing this avalanche of self-absorbed entitled complaints . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It is his religious belief that a civil marriage contract is between a man and a woman . His religious belief is the law and he supports that law . It is a religious law that is no difference then sharia law . His religious beliefs should have nothing to do with civil law . Further my religious beliefs are being violated .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Then how can non-religious people ( like me ) recognize that man and woman has always been what marriage meant ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Because there is such a thing as a legal contract signed between two people and the state , simple as that .</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10951_34_32__39_41_42_44_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You've got nothing but your usual drivel , denials , whines , and unfounded conjecture . When you grow a pair of cojones and back it up with some credible arguments and credible scholarship that busts the resurrection of Christ , then you will have gained some credibility around here . Until then you're nothing more than a noisy little Christ denier .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>LMAO .. I do believe that is the lamest reply you have ever produced .. It's apparent that you are frustrated and that might be throwing you off a little .... 1 : There were no Eye witness accounts of any resurrection recorded , everything written in the Gospels is hearsay . 2 : there is zero , nada , no evidence left behind of any resurrection ... taking a mythical story for it's literal word and convincing a few billion M o r o n s that it is real does not make it true . 3 : we know from scientific evidence and just from basic human intelligence that once a man dies and is dead for 3 days he does not get up and walk away .. sorry .. I know it hurts . 4 : add in the inconsistencies , the so called " facts " that in no way match with history , the lack of any evidence other than what you have been taught in your cult , and I would assume that the burden of proof for any resurrection would fall on YOU ... but we all know that won't happen so commence with the insults ... Does that mean I get to go to the Pit now ? .... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You might as well drop down into the Pit for all the nonsense you just spewed out . It just another crock pot full of left wing , antichrist dysentery .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If it's so much nonsense then why not give us a first hand account of your overwhelming brilliance and post your evidence to prove me wrong ? See Ezridden that is where you always seem to fail . When faced with facts and reality you always come up short . The really , REALLY ironic part of all this is the fact that if indeed " the pit " really existed and your book of fairy tales was really the key to salvation and all , well according to your own fairy tale and the way you So called " Christians " are supposed to live then You my intelligence challenged friend would be standing right next to me and ole Smiley in that " Pit " you seem to love talking about . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>There's no Sodomites in heaven . You're out of luck ( unless you repent of your stiff-necked disobedience to God ) .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yep smiley pegged you correctly . You can't post the evidence to prove me wrong so you resort to name calling and insult and completely go off topic in hopes that you won't be forced to use that pea brain of yours ... Nice try but you still have nothing ...</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-788_17_16__19_20_21_22_23_26_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>There you go using the " N " word . I suppose you think you are normal too huh ? At least 2 men in a loving , comitted relationship follow the pratice of fidelity , unlike the man who has 1 wife for each day of the week .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>How do you know that the man who has 1 wife for each day of the week doesn't love his wives , or isn't committed to them . Same for the wives toward their husband ? Just curious ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I never stated that the husband or wives were not comitted to each other , I brought up the idea of fidelity . Isn't fidelity part of the american attitude of " normal " ? Or at least it is the view of the christian reich .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Time / CNN poll conducted by Harris Interactive . Nov 18 - 19 , 2003 N = 1,507 adults nationwide MoE =/ - 2.5% ( total sample ) Question " Do you think marriages between homosexual men or homosexual women should be recognized as legal by the law or not ? Yes 32% No 62% Not Sure 6% http://www.pollingreport.com/civil.htm In this poll , 59% of DEMOCRATS were opposed to homosexual marriage for emn or women . Are the Democrats now part of the Christian reich , as well ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Somehow , I think it goes a little deeper than party lines .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I believe what we are seeing is a reaction to the heterophobes that want to foist gay marriage upon the rest of America . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>What exactly is a heterophobe , and how are they " foisting " gay marriage upon America ? And tell me please , what exactly is your problem with gay marriage , why are you so opposed to it ?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>When a person is opposed to gay marriage they are often called a homophobe . When a person is opposed to the banning of gay marriage , they must therefore be a heterophobe . Because a have a personal right to be opposed to it , just as you have a right to be for it , if you indeed are . The Constitution of the U.S. gives me this right to be opposed to it , just as it gives you the right to be for it .</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-788_12_9__15_31_35_40_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It would lead ultimately down the road to a marriage bill for polygamists . That is why the current push for a Constitutional Amendment to ban gay marriage also contains a provision banning polygamous marriage as well . Hmm .... some opposition to the petition ... More left wing ideology at work .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>If the man after God    s own heart had multiple wives , why can    t I ? :) I have heard others say that we already have polygamy in America . It    s called serial polygamy because of our liberal divorce laws . So now those that are opposed to even more laws on the books and a return to Old Testament practices are considered left wing ? What    s this world coming too ? LOL <br><b>S1:2-  </b>King David having multiple wives was under Old Testament practice . Jesus himself stated that divorce laws were granted by Moses and allowed by God because of the hardness of the people hearts . Jesus said a man shall leave his father and mother and be cleaved to his WIFE , Not WIVES . BTW , its called serial MONOGAMY . If its ' right wing ' to support a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage than its ' left wing ' to oppose a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So is it a sin or just a practice ? I don    t remember Jesus saying polygamy was wrong . The statement you referred to does indicate that he was talking about a single wife , but I wouldn    t base a whole social convention on one word out of a whole book . Anyway the Jews don    t believe in the New Testament . Would it be okay for them ? Man I screwed that one up . I    ll try to be a little more articulate in the future . :) Okay I was just wondering . I base my wing on what I think is correct , not left or right . A few years ago it was right wing to be against the deficit , now it seems to be left wing . But that just shows what I know about wings . LOL <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The idea that it is now left wing to be against deficits is absurd . Numerous Democrats actually wanted to spend more than the Bush Administrations 12.5% increase in federal spending .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I was basing that on your previous statement In other words , anything that is opposed to one wing must be the opposite so I don    t see how it    s absurd unless you want to call your original statement absurd . This is obviously not the thread for this discussion but I will reply this time and see where it takes us . You didn    t state what you considered to be    numerous    nor did you supply anything to back up that statement . However deficits depend on both increased spending and lower revenues . Bush has done both with large tax cuts and large discretionary spending increases . And even the conservatives are beginning to criticize him for being a big spending president . Over the past 23 years ,    conservative    administrations have increased the deficits and    liberal    administrations have decreased the deficits . So yeah it looks to me like left wing is against deficits and right wing is for deficits .</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-5320_25_16__33_34_35_36_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Well ... so far eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue have found that barring same-sex marriage is unconstitutional . We're waiting to hear about three or four more . As for the nature of marriage , it is both a legal contract and ( sometimes ) a religious ceremony ( sacrament in some religions ) . We're stuck with the duality , whether we like it or not , and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect . Different religions can do what they want .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>They found that it violated their state constitutions , right ? This has nothing to do with the US Constitution . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The winning arguments were based largely on state constitutional provisions that closely parallel , if not outright mimmick , the federal constitution .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That's not generally true , is it ? For example , the Massachusetts ruling was based on a specific provision in the Mass . constitution that prohibits discrimination based on sexual preference . There's nothing like that in the US constitution . And my overall point was that we should be careful when calling something " unconstitutional " , in that we should be clear it we're talking state or federal constitution . Many state constitutions guarantee rights that aren't in the fedral constitution . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>There's nothing like that in the Mass . Constitution either . Though , it's a darned good idea ! Goodrich was decided on equal protection grounds , citing the Mass . document . I'd have to look up the others to see the exact reasoning , but they're not likely to be far afield from the bedrock principles of equal protection and due process . Gay rights is a real test of our constitutional system , and , so far , we're not passing with flying colors ...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're right , I misremembered . It's just descrimination based on sex that's banned .</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-9989_176_171__177_180_181_183_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>This is off-topic , but I do not see any forum on Supreme Court issues or constitutional interpretation generally . The New York Times has a little quiz to see how our views line up with those of the current Supreme Court and with the American public on various constitutional questions . Here is a link to the quiz : NY Times Advertisement Although I am liberal in my political views , my answers to the quiz questions indicate that I am in the center when it comes to constitutional questions .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What an awful quiz . It reinforces my point that people are making the court a second legislative body . If we want them to make decisions like this we are better off just having congress do it . At least they are voted in . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The problem with the quiz is that it just asks people's opinion about the issue ; it does not address the constitutional questions involved . The Supreme Court should not rule based on their opinions of the issue ; they should rule based on their interpretation of the constitution . The Supreme Court has ruled on the issues in the quiz , but their rulings should not have been based on what individual justices happen to think of guns or abortion .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>And the rulings shouldn't be considered " conservative " or " liberal " . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Right . Court rulings are interpretations of the constitution , and they are not , or should not be , expressions of the justices ' personal political beliefs . Even the NYTimes story saying that the Roberts court leans " conservative " does not really make sense , as " conservative " suggests a political viewpoint , not a philosophy of judicial interpretation .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Right , for example the ruling allowing corporations to run campaign ads or whatever was not really conservative ... pro corporation maybe but that doesn't necessary mean conservative ( perhaps more " republican " ) . Scalia actually goes around and does a speech where he gives examples of rulings he has made that upset both sides basically saying he doesn't care who he offends . Reading some of his opinions makes me believe he really doesn't care about offending people haha .</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-9391_34_33__35_36_48_50_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>First of all , to convince me of that you will to find real scientific evidence . Anything coming from Cameron is suspect for reasons already pointed out ; he has kicked been out of the legitimate scientific community , gotten in trouble judges and had NUMEROUS scientists publicly condemn him for misuse of their research . Secondly even if this were true , and their lifespans were shorter , that does not legitimize anti-gay legislation or discrimination . What I am saying is that such measures from people like you hurt them . Their being gay does not hurt you . You are in the wrong as you are on the end that is inflicting damage .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Here's a hypothetical situation for you , Jito . You    re the minister of public health for a country in BFE . You're given indisputable proof that a small portion of the population has contracted a disease linked directly to their lifestyle that reduces their lifespan by 20 years . What do you do : a . Ignore it b . Take steps to prevent further spread c . Reward the infected and promote their lifestyle d . None of the above <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Homosexuality is not a disease so the analogy you are building is false . If you are going to segue into HIV , that virus will infect ANYONE and just being gay does not put you at greater risk . Promsicuity and IV drug usage do - but neither of those behaviors are the exclusive realm of homosexuals .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Don't cop out , Jito . Anser the question AS WRITTEN . No assumptions . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I will not . You are building an analagy that is based in the idea that homosexuality is a disease or in some other way harmful . Its not , I will not give credit to the analagy .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I've already proven time and time again that granting gays the rights and plivleges of marriage DOES affect the rest of us financially . Your failure to admit that fact shows the disengenuity of your position . You're chickening out because you know what the only logical answer can be . I thought that you had more integrity than copping out like that , Jito .</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-9391_125_113__126_136_140_142_154_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>OOH bitchy ay ? Its worse than I thought you actually dont know your a*se from your Any sexual activity between two men is deviant sex Two men getting hard and lucky on each other is not approved by most people , believe me . This is the bit that amuses me ! When the gay starts losing an argument they start implying that the objector is a closet homosexual .. 50 years ago it would be ridiculous to contemplate two Homosexuals ' marrying ' . nowdays it may well become reality . The pedophiles are rubbing their hands no doubt<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Bologna . This straight gal is here to tell you most people really don't care about the sex lives of other adults and current stats show that with the exception of gay marriage that most people support equal rights for gays and believe homosexuality is perfectly acceptable . My son's ( adoptive ) father is gay , is a marvelous father and one the greatest blessings in our life . My old man is one these big macho , traditional , conservative types and my son's father a hundred times the man and father my father is . Frankly , he is one of the best fathers I have ever known . Denying needing children a loving parent ( s ) to satiate you bigotry , now THAT is a crime . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No they dont , most people do not trust gays Good for you . Now lets let gay men adopt children and teach them the joys of man love . Gayhumanist knows all about sodomy , let him start .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Quite being so infantile . You are like a two year old . You are not representative of anything .

And just who the hell are " they " ? I don't know every gay person on the planet . I have a lesbian friend - we have giggled and enjoyed eachother's company since I was 17 . I also have a doting lesbian aunt . My son's father has been a loving parent and good friend . If this is being used they can have at it . I already acknowledged that there not have majority support for gay marriage ( not that being in a majority automatically makes you right ) . I was responding to gansao's comment that most people don't trust gays . Do pay attention to what you are reading . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So because you have a lesbian friend and know a nice gay man we should all agree that gays should be allowed to ' marry ' and we also should all approve of perverted sex ? I had a bisexual girlfriend who became a prostitute .. she was nice too .... so what ? You are right .. most people do not trust gays .. and this has usually nothing to do with religion either .</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-9391_451_450__456_457_458_461_463_466_4<br><b>S1:1-  </b>That is the whole point isn't it . Marriage is a contract between the state and the two people involved . The whole ironic thing is to the anti gay christianists that are so opposed to gay marries the religious marriage is what counts and is the important aspect but they can not stop gay people from getting religious marriage only the contract from the state , which to the anti gay christianists means nothing . How are they harmed if two men they do not know sign a contract with the state . Are they going to be offended If I form a corporation ? It is none of their business , just as their marriages are none of my business . Yes they are forced to have to accept same sex marriages big f'n deal I am forced to accept their hetero marriages . They didn't ask my permission if they could get married so why should I have to ask their permission ?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I suppose . I'm not religious , so what Christians do is pretty meaningless to me . I would not claim anyone is harmed . But we all have to live in this society , so the official policies are our business . Your threat here is empty since heterosexual marriage is the status quo . You have to justify changes you wish to make to the status quo , but what currently is in place doesn't need justification . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It was a christian organization , or group , or christianally deluded legislators in every case that gathered signatures for and put these marriage amendments on the ballot in every state . If I own a business I am legally forced , as a gay man , to recognise that hetero marriage . Your right we all have to live in this society and they demand that I respect , and acknowledge , their marriages . One could use your argument about slavery , misogyny , or any other unjust system . It is the status quo so there is nothing wrong with it .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Good for them . It's an issue that should be voted on " right " and " wrong " are value judgements . It is the challenger's responsibility not to show the status quo as unjust , but that their proposal is somehow better than the status quo . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So then all civil rights from freedom of speech to religious freedom should be voted upon ? Because I would love to vote to take religious freedom away from the christianists . nonsense it is called protecting heterosexual privilege and nothing more .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>What civil rights ? Are unmarried individuals denied rights ? What privilege is that ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>That is not the question I asked Do you believe taht basic rights such as freedom of speech and religion should go on to the ballot ? For instance do you think that the religious freedom of say that mormon , for instance , should go on the ballot for people to vote away ? The privlege they are trying to defend by keeping gay people from marriage .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Since they are Constitutional rights , it would be slightly impossible to do :P What privelige is that ? We don't have a right to love ( at least , not one the gov't can help with ) . We don't have a right to marry whomever we love , or to love whomever we marry .

I'm sure you could also tell that one to chuck smith and he'd snicker or at the sunday brunch at whatever church it is you go to ... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The sad thing once again jason , is that you and Jake just fail to comprehend the seriousness of the spiritual situation you are in . And you prove that sentiment by thinking that anything about your lifestyle is funny in any way to anyone . So NO jason , from the saints at the pearly gates to Chuck Smith , to me , nobody is laughing at the reality of the perverted and sick sexual proclivities which define the unnatural practices which have been conceived of and engaged in by your ilk .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Can't you tell sarcasm when you see it or are you really that blind ? Funny thing is but I wasn't the one making jokes about gerbils being inserted into someones rectum YOU WERE . So do not sit here and once again spew the same ranting and raving about " lifestyle " and " ilk " like the thousands of other times before ... And here we go again the proverbial merry go round . Sex sex sex sex sex .... Gee Archie is that all you think about when it comes to people ? I mean honestly can ; t you think of a better argument to come up with ? No one cares what other people do in the bedroom simply because it is private ! You don't define your next door neighbor based upon what he does in the bedroom , or your mailman or the guy who works in the toll booth . Simply put Americans could care less what other people do behind closed doors . And what you do behind closed doors does not define you as a person ! If it did people would probably be calling you " stale " ..... Now there's a joke Archie laugh it up ... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Who's joking ; not me , at all .

And that's because I'm just religious enough to view marriage as a sacrament and the Bible's pretty clear on homosexuality .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Then favor them for everyone . Go down to your county clerks office and tell them you want to convert your marriage license to a civil union . Flygirl challenged you to do so but I suppose that even if that were possible you wouldn't do it you like you heterosexual privilege too much . The bible has nothing and should have nothing to do with the law . The bible is nothing more then a book of fairy tales told to scare little children . There in not one thing eventrue in the book . Grimm's fairy tales has more truth in it then the bible . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You make no sense ... as usual . Why would someone that considers marriage a sarcament go down to city hall to have it turned into a civil union ? Sorry , but I'm allowed to vote as I want based on whatever criteria I feel inclined to use . The fact that the majority of Americans feel the same way is refreshing , IMO .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>And you hit the nail on the head with this one . The US government does not consider marriage to be a sarcament . You are mixing religion and government . A marriage liscense is a secular document that is a contract between the state and the the couple , it has nothing to do with religion . You have said you favor civil unions for gay people and I am saying that if you think that civil unions are equal to marriage just a different name then you go turn in your liscense in favor of a civil union . However you know that they aren't so you will never do it , even if it were possible . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>As a voter , I can mix whatever I want . That's the part that you aren't getting . Uncle Sam can't establish a religion or give special consideration to one religion ; voters can do whatever they please and I choose to not want same sex marriage included under the definition of marriage . As for civil unions , I think your time would be better spent trying to fill the gaps in it instead of trying to scrap the current definition of marriage .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Fine then I think the people of California should decide weather the people of Michigan can get to have drivers licenses . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Since when does one state get to make thast determination for another state ? You're building moldy strawmen now , Matt .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Since when does group of citizens get to vote on the civil rights of another group when the vote will not effect them ? Letting the majority vote on whether a minority gets to marry is like letting the people of California decide if the people of Michigan get driver licenses . The people of California still get to drive and it hasn't effected their lives but with their vote they have adversely effected the lives of others . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I've already proven time and time again that granting gays the rights and plivleges of marriage DOES affect the rest of us financially .

What is the reason it's not legally recognized ? Because the couple is gay . Where do you get the figure of 500,000 gay couples who want to immediately be married ? Would these gay couples beat the straight couples in some kind of a race to the weddings occurring at the same time , or occurring over the course of a month or a year ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>They're not legally recognized because they don't meet the legal criteria for marriage , ie one man , one woman . A cat doesn't meet the legal definition of a dog . Do we change the definition of dog to appease the cat ? That's the real question to be answered by society . Actually , I pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only , but after reading the CBO report , I see that I wasn't far off . They predicted 600,000 gay couples would want to get married it allowed .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This is circular reasoning however . It's stating that marriage simply is heterosexual , and so completely ends debate . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Exactly my point , just as a cat can never be considered a dog just because someone wants it to be . To me , and I'm guessing millions of others , the term gay marriage is an oxymoron . That's not to say that we shouldn't consider the possibility of allowing gay unions with , possibly , equivalent rights to hetero couples if we , as a society , see the benefit in doing so . For example , prior to FDR , the concept of state welfare was considered ludicrous and unconstitutional , but he was able to get enough support ( and enough political muscle ) to change society's mind on the role of the Federal gov't once he demonstrated the " good " that doing so had on America in its most dire time of need . People were willing to sacrifice a little freedom for security just as Ben Franklin had warned against .

I'll ask you the same question : What do you mean by that ?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Jefferson's views were that democracy was with power of the people . He also understood the need for war when it comes to pursuing , perserving and maintaining liberty ( " the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots & tyrants . It is its natural manure " ) . He believed liberty was threatened by a consolidated , centralized government , which is radically different than liberalism today , which takes the very opposite stance , IMO . Decentralization was a big theme to Jefferson . He would have opposed over-regulation . Liberalism today has abandoned a lot of what Jefferson believed , kept what they prefer , and changed it . There are many aspects of HIS liberalism I would agree with : I like their focus on domestic social issues such as taking care of elderly , making sure there is fairness , freedom for black people , etc. But liberalism as embodied today by the Democratic party has become anti-religion , over-regulatory , and it's been taken over by extremist special interest groups such as the gay lobby and others ( much the same way the Republicans were taken over by the religious right in the 80 s ) . It's a political favor game now , not honest advocacy for the people as Jefferson would have had it . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Are you not doing the exact same thing ?

It's not the way children are created ( adopted , serrogacy , etc ) . It ' s the nature of the relationship ( heterosexual ) . Natural refers to nature not child bearing .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>which god enforces marriage rules when the cermony is performend by a judge ? There was a tribe in the Congo that allowed it . Their shamans told them that the warriors could only marry outer warriors . To be with a women , they thought , might make then softer , and more woman like , and not as fearless in combat . Ok , so conceiving a child is not what makes it nature , what is it ? Wouldn    t polygamy also include some of that same sex taboo , to women marred together ? Why do you feel your values are right and others that disagree as wrong ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Polygamy is not women married together . It's one man or women married to multiple of the opposite sex like a harem or entourage . Everyone feels their values are right or else they wouldn't believe in them . What we value shows . Of course atheist don't believe in God so they have a different set of values . I of course believe in God first , family second , and country third . If you have different values then of course you will think yours are better if not then you wouldn't have them . Our values are what guide us .

You probably think otherwise but I feel statistically I can support mine .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Sorry , I don    t practice Polygamy ; I don    t know the inner workings of the family . I would think it would be a good way for bi-sexual to stay below the radar . I worded the question badly ; I should have asked why do you feel that your morals should be forced on to others ?

Make no mistake about it , Gay marriage IS about ECONOMICS . Any claims to the contrary are simply false .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Are you saying that gay people who pay into the same systems , shouldn't also benefit ? Speaking of dependency , imagine a scenario where a gay person is in a same-sex marriage , that is not legally recognized . This person is also dependent on the other spouse . The marriage breaks up . Now , the taxpayer must support the dependent partner , because the marriage was not legally recognized . If it were legal , the richer partner could have been made to support the poorer one , after divorce . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Same sex marriage marriage partners that aren't legally mrried are called ROOMMATES . Do we want to start giving benefits to all singles sharing apartments regardless of sexual bent ?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That is a separate issue , and could also involve different sex people . We are not talking about singles , or roomates , when we talk of marriage . I don't see roomates sharing an apartment arguing for such a recognition or responsibility . As much as many trust and care for their roomates , it's not by that much . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No , we're not talking about marriage . We're talking about a relationship that some want us to all believe is a marriage . Well , if I want to marry my dog , can I ? Of course I can't .

Polygamy is not more acceptable by the standards of Western society . I'm not sure I would call it a significant factor of contemporary Western society . It is significant in patriarchal societies . No court or government in Western society has recognized marriage rights for polygamists .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Should they ? What are western standards ? What were they 20 yrs ago ? What were they 100 yrs ago ? Marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It's not just for a heterosexual contract in the Netherlands , Belgium , most of Canada , and probably not limited that way for much longer in Sweden and Spain . It won't be just for a heterosexual contract in Mass . in May . There are married heterosexual couples who either choose to not have children , or cannot have children . So it is not just for having a family unit with children either .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This isn't europe . There dirinking laws , prostituition laws , and many other laws are different than ours . SO are many other countries . If we want to talk about the world the over 90% of the world doesn't recognize homosexuality . Mass is taking stpes to ban it . Hawaii did the same thing in 1997 and their legislature stopped it . I believe Mass will do the same . A family is the basic unit in society traditionally consisting of two parents rearing their own or adopted children ; also : any of various social units differing from but regarded as equivalent to the traditional family < a single-parent family > . We're talking about traditional families . A family can be just a wife and husband . It can't be two husbands . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Well , Europe or Canada is more similar to the U.S. than Iran or Saudi Arabia or Namibia . Any steps will take years , after the legal marriages have already taken place , if those steps are even successful . Single parent families are not generally viewed as traditional .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yeah this country is more similar to Anglo countries . What's your point ? What happens in 2050 when they predict minorites will be over 50% of this country ? Hawaii did it in a year . But it is veiwed as natural <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Look at the current hoity-toity polls which show strong support for gay rights among those 18 - 29 . I don't see polygamy as a value among minorities in the U.S. Hawaii was different , as the legislature made changes against marriage for gays , while the stayed decision was being appealed to the Supreme Court . So is casual sex and rabies . We don't judge something as good simply because it is natural . Single parenthood is not viewed as the moral traditional ideal among conservatives .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>They don't ask them about polygamy . Also gays rights is more political than anything else . It doesn't really matter does it . We'll see in the end who's right . Single parent is natural . Many husbands die early . That's natural . unwed mothers is not considered moral but it's still natural . Casual sex is natural but not rational . It will lead to other problems . Rabies are viruses .

I'm talking ab out teh major earthquakes taht could be detected wihtout a seizmograph in the major countries in the civilized world . The evidence of teh earthquakes that could be measured in the 1800 s in teh countries documented compared to thiose same earthquakes now are expontially increasing . We doin ; t need to count the minor ones in remote places . Go to ANY and ALL sources and count them . I did my research but you obviously didn't . Still remember that you also are only specualting thqat it the reason for more .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Mana'ia , See my first response to your earthquake nonsense . Research hey Waxy <br><b>S1:4-  </b>That is the only argument you have but it isn't supported by the facts . Show me if you can that it isn't .

This is unfortunate if it applies to public officials . I believe public officials are there to serve all members of the public , equally under the law . That's their job .

Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones . 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another .

Go tell that tripe to your pet carp . You're one day closer to the Pit and you haven't wised up yet . No wonder you're lost .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Sorry , last time I checked my rights as an American Citizen weren't dictated by the Bible or ANY " holy " book for that matter . You want to impose a christian state where the good old boys have their glory days back , McCarthyism runs rampant , and the paddy-wagons line the streets just waiting to pick up your version of " degenerates . " Your views do NOTHING positive for this Country . They do nothing to empower American Citizens , their crude , damning , repetitive , and non productive in any way shape or form ...

But here's another tale of the sanctity of christian marriage . At age 17 , Fred Thompson knocked up his 18 year old girlfriend , Sarah Lindsey . Her family agreed to let him marry her , and helped him through college and law school , then got him a job in one of the family law firms . They had three children and were married for 26 years . They were divorced in the mid 80 s . His oldest child would be older than his second wife . One of his children from the first marriage apparently died from a drug over dose ( which is truly sad event ) . Now he has two more children , one four and one not a year , at age 65 . He claims to be a member of the Churches of Christ , another religious cult , but no one can say what church he attends or when ( rather like Bush and the Alabama Air National Guard ) . James Dobson says Thompson is not really a christian . Oh well .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So does Dobson think the man is just acting <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Does Dobson THINK ?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Hard to say , but I do believe he thinks about his own well being and economic status .

Who do you think made AIDS a major health concern in the US ? If you have anything via proof that it's not true , bring it on . I welcome the debate . So far , all I've seen is attempts to change the debate , attack me personally or make unsubstantiated statements that don't mean #### .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Okay , you'll get an answer to this question . First off , no one knows how AIDS actually got to the US . Secondly , as to who made AIDS a major health concern , they would be people who didn't clean their needles and such while doing drugs , and people who did not practice safe sex , as well those giving blood transfusions before it was known that HIV / AIDS could be spread through blood . No more , no less . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Do you have something of substance to back your claim or are you going to stick with your opinion only ?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well for that , we'll have to quote one of your recent posts : <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I'm still waiting for anything of content to stream from your keyboard .

I'm flattered . Now , when do you want the debate to start or are you still afraid ?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>The debate will start once you personally own up to your own requirements of others . Until then , I will continue to note the hypocrisy in you expecting others to defend something when you yourself are unwilling to do the same with your statement .

Is that good enough for you ?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-1875_13_11__14_16_31_39_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Healthcare usually applies to spouses . Therefore , if it is illegal for gays to marry in VA , he gets no healthcare . It's a fairly simple law to understand . It works the same way with a straight guy who has a girlfriend ... she doesn't get healthcare provided by his job . I hope the gays who are upset with VA leave . It will cause less havoc in the state .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Which part about not allowing them to become spouses don't you get ? The straight guy can marry his girlfriend so she gets the benefits . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>And the point is , in VA gays can't get married , therefore they can't share their gay lover's healthcare . Simple as that . Hopefully gay marriages will be outlawed everywhere so we don't have to continue to hear them bitch and moan about healthcare . If a man has a girlfriend , do you believe she is entitled to get healthcare from his job ?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Actually if they cohabitate for a prescribed period of time or have children together I would say yes . Commonlaw as it were . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Common law is 2 words buddy .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Or hyphenated . Thank you . I stand corrected .</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-1875_21_20__22_24_25_27_30_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>So , then 2 gays people living together in VA shouldn't expect healthcare , since a couple who isn't married doesn't get it .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>" thats just the way it is " isn't much of an argument ! So , basically you don't care that some people can have rights , while others who should have them don't get them . So , I take it you liked segregation , prohabition and prefer women barefoot in the kitchen rather than at the polls voting for anything . Wow ! all I an say is wow . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I'm guessing you mean " prohibition " . Gays don't have the right to shared healthcare because they're not married ! Gays have rights ... they can marry members of the opposite sex . Nobody can marry members of the opposite sex , it's not just gays . Gays have all the rights that straight people do . Straights can't marry people of the same sex , and neither can gays . If straigh people want heatlcare , they can marry someone of the opposite sex ... so can gays !<br><b> S2:2-  </b>We don't have the right to marry who we love and if ya didn't notice it isn't someone of the same sex . What a ridculous posts ! We are fighting to the right to marry , we will win , we will have healthcare and we are in your neighborhood too ! Trust me , we are nor backing down to the xtian right wing . We shall overcome ! <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Haha !! It seems like " you all " are going in the wrong direction then . Thousands of gays in San Francisco recently had their marriages enulled . A judge in Seattle was also told he can't allow gays to get married . Missouri just voted to outlaw gay marriage ( 70% of the people voted to ban it ... pretty alarming if you ask me ) . How do you figure you are in the process to " overcome " ? It looks quite the opposite if you ask me . The only luck you have is moving to another country or moving to Massachusetts . Mark my word , there will never be a federal law allowing gay marriages in the US .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>That's just what they said about slavery , women voting , interacial marriage . It is what they said about people flying , looking for a cure to polio , It is always darkest before the dawn ! <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Looking at slavery is incorrect . Slavery was wrong because certain individuals who couldn't change their color were targeted and often tortured . They were treated as property and had no rights . HOWEVER , gays have the exact same rights as heterosexuals and are not property , nor can they be targeted by color , etc. Women voting is also a terrible example . That has to do with free speech , which is an unalienable right ( last time I checked , gays being allowed to marry wasn't an unalienable right ) . That was also when women couldn't hold jobs and had to work in the home . Gays don't have to do that . Interracial marriage goes along with slavery and is an absolutely terrible example . It was looked down upon , not illegal . Thomas Jefferson had children by a black woman .</p></body> </html>
