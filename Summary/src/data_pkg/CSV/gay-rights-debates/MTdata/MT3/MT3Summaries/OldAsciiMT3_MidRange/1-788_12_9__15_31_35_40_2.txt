Two people are debating the topic of gay marriage rights.  S1 believes allowing gays to marry will open up the door to legalize other types of marriage such as polygamy.  S2 holds to the theory that if King David was able to have multiple wives, why then should the common man not be able to, especially if religion is to now be the basis for all laws.  S1 contends that practice was of the Old Testament and is no longer considered commonplace.  S2 feels S1 is too left wing to entertain the thought of allowing gay marriage, but uses religion as the basis even though there are so many contradictions between the Old Testament and what is considered the New Testament.

S1 stated that the legalization of gay marriage would lead to polygamists getting the right to marry so many laws against gay marriage also outlaw polygamy.  He then said that the Right Wing was against both gay marriage and polygamy while the left wing was for it. He then said that many Democrats were bigger spenders than the Republicans.
S2 said that it was funny to him that those for less laws on the books and a return to the Old Testament practices including polygamy are now considered left wing.  He said that he does what he thinks is right and believes that Jesus is not against polygamy. He said too that the past Democratic presidents left far fewer deficits than the Republican presidents.

S1 claims that legalizing homosexual marriage would eventually lead to the legalization of polygamous marriage, citing a proposed constitutional amendment that bans both gay marriage and polygamy. He cites a passage from the Bible where Jesus said a man should be cleaved to his wife.  He claims that if people on the right wing support a ban on gay marriage, then the left wing must oppose a ban on gay marriage.
S2 cites instances of God supporting polygamy in the Bible. He claims that we already practice serial polygamy because of America's liberal divorce laws. He also points out the logical fallacy in S1's argument about the left and right wing, stating that one wing supporting something doesn't mean the other wing opposes it.

Two people are discussing gay marriage and law. S1 states that gay marriage will ultimately lead to a marriage bill for polygamists.  He states King David had multiple wives under the Old testament, and that divorce laws were granted by Moses because of the hardness of people's hearts. In addition, he states that the left wing aren't against deficits, since numerous Democrats want to spend more than Bush.  S2  states that America already has serial polygamy due to the liberal divorce laws. He doesn't remember Jesus saying polygamy was wrong, and even though he referred to a single wife, basing a whole social convention on one word out of the book is absurd. He also states that even conservatives criticize Bush's spending.

S1 talks about gay marriage leading to polygamy and that's why the push for the Constitutional Amendment banning gay marriage has a provision banning polygamy. S1 thinks King David having more than one wife was based on Old Testament law and Jesus believed in having one wife. He thinks if it's right wing to support a ban on gay marriage/polygamy then it's left wing to oppose it. He states some Democrats wanted to spend more than Bush. S2 thinks if it was okay for King David to have more than one wife it should be fine for him, and brings up that Jews don't follow the New Testament. He believes anything opposed to one wing must be the other. He thinks conservatives spend more money.
