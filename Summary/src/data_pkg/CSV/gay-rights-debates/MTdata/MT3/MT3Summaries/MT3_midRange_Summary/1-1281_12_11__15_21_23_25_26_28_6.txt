S2 claims that marriage is defined as a family unit based on a heterosexual contract. S1 refutes this assertion, citing a number of countries which recognize same-sex marriage and compares the lack of reproductive potential for homosexual couples to a heterosexual couple that chooses not to have children or is unable to have children. He also argues that single parent families are not considered traditional and references a poll showing support for gay rights among the 18 - 29 demographic. S2 claims that a traditional family is composed of a husband and wife and that the laws of other countries are irrelevant to the laws of America. He argues that single parent families are natural and suggests that time will decide which side is right.

S1 asserts that polygamous marriage is not recognized by governments in Western societies and is unlikely to be recognized in future. S1 points to the trend to legalize gay marriage in western countries such as Netherlands, Belgium, and most of Canada. He points to high support for gay marriages among the 18-29 year-olds in the US. He argues that these show that legalizing gay marriage may happen in the future. 
S2 asserts that marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract out. He argues that even though some European countries allow gay marriage, 90% of the world bans gay marriages. He argues that the US is not Europe and is unlikely to move in the same direction on legalizing gay.

Two people are discussing gay marriage issues.  S1 is in favor of gay marriage while S2 is against.  S2 cites the fact that gay marriage is already allowed in many countries and feels it soon will be in the state of Massachusetts.  S2 feels the US will not pass the laws so easily citing the fact that Hawaii has already banned the practice.  S2 also feels the issue of gay rights is more political.  He disputes S1's comparison between gay marriage and polygamy, which he fees could be the next thing allowed should gay marriage become commonplace.  S2 holds to the idea that it will be passed and passed soon.  S1 feels any headway will take many years.

S1 states that all sex is behavior. He points out that it is not just about heterosexual contact in many countries. He says there are many married heterosexual couples who either choose not to have children or can't, so marriage is not simply about having a family. He states the US is more similar to Anglo nations and in many of those gay marriage is legal. He says something isn't judged as good just because it is natural. S2 thinks marriage is recognizing a family unit based on natural heterosexual contact. He says that there are many laws different than the US in other nations. He thinks family is a basic unit traditionally consisting of two parents raising children. Homosexuals, he believes, are more political.

Two people are discussing gay marriage and politics.  S1 states that no one in western society has recognized marriage rights for polygamists, to which S2 rebuts, stating that marriage is recognizing a family unit based on heterosexual contract.  S1 then states that in many anglo countries, it is not for a heterosexual contract, and in marriage with couples who cannot have children, it's not for a family unit either. He also states that single families is not natural.  S2 contends that European countries have many laws different than the US, but the world majority views it as about the traditional families.  He states that single parent is natural as husbands die early and gay rights is more about politics.
