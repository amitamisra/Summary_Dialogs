S1 claims that the research demonstrating shorter lifespans for homosexuals has been discredited, and that even if it were true, it would not make anti-gay discrimination acceptable. He rejects the analogy proposed by S2 where a hypothetical disease is contracted by a small population due to their chosen lifestyle, arguing that homosexuality is not a disease. He explains that anyone is capable of contracting HIV and that the virus is spread by promiscuity and drug use, meaning that it is not exclusive to homosexuals. S2 reiterates his assertion that legalizing same-sex marriage affects the rest of the population financially. He then attacks S1's character, claiming that the strength of his own position has caused S1 to deflect the obviously accurate assertion that S2 has proposed.

S1 and S2 are discussing gay marriage.  S1 is in favor of same sex marriage while S2 opposes.  S2 seems to believe that the gay community is singularly responsible for the spread of HIV and for that reason should not be permitted to marry.  S1 feels this is a way of saying homosexuality is a disease and S1 does not feel that is the case.  S1 wants scientific proof of the information S2 offers and does not feel Cameron is a viable source.  S2 adheres to the opinion that allowing homosexuals to wed would effect the rest of society financially.  S2 accuses S1 of chickening out because he/she does not want to answer the hypothetical question posed about HIV.

S1 does not believe that any evidence coming from Cameron should not be viewed without suspicion on grounds that he has been kicked out of the legitimate scientific community and has gotten in trouble with judges and scientists that publicly condemn him for misusing their research. They argue that even if it were true, it does not legitimize anti-gay legislation or discrimination and that being homosexual does not hurt anyone, nor should it be counted as a disease. They believe that HIV can affect anyone, not just the homosexual community.
S2 believes that giving homosexuals rights and privileges affects everyone else financially. They believe that something should be done if a scientific study links a dangerous disease to the activities of a certain group of people.

Two people are discussing gay rights.  S1 challenges S2 to find real scientific evidence, as anything coming from Cameron doesn't apply as he has been kicked out and condemned publicly from the legitimate scientific community.  He also states that homosexuality is not a disease, and that HIV infects anyone; being gay does not put people at a greater risk, promiscuity and IV drug usage do.  S2 gives a hypothetical situation, where a minister of public health has proof that people with a certain lifestyle live shorter and he questions what S1 will do in that situation.  He also states that granting gays the rights and privileges of marriage affects everyone financially and negatively.

S1 rejects the idea that homosexuality is a disease. He doubts the evidence by Cameron due to the fact that he was kicked out of the legitimate scientific community and has numerous scientists condemn him for misuse of research. S1 states that HIV will affect anyone and being gay does not put one at greater risk, but promiscuity and drug use do and are not exclusive to homosexuals. He believes the analogy of homosexuality as a disease is harmful. S2 gives a hypothetical situation in which a minister of public health has proof that part of a population has contracted a disease due to their lifestyle and questions what the proper response should be. S2 believes that granting gay marriage rights effects everyone else financially.
