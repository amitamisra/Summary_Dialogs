S1 is against gay rights apparently because of the biblical story of Sodom, and the sexual activities S1 perceives to have occurred in San Francisco bath houses, which S1 asserts the current gay community is trying to re-open.  He argues that the gay community is going back to unprotected sex and that a daisy chain of 100 men perform unprotected sex on each other in the bath houses.  S2 challenges the assumptions, specifically finding the daisy chain of 100 men a less than credible assertion and admonishes S1 to use facts to support his arguments, not opinions.  S2 also notes that S1's apparent fascination with bath houses is not relevant to the gay rights topic under which the posts are being entered.

Two people are discussing gay rights.  S1 compares the behavior of the gay community to Sodom.  He references how in the 80s bath houses in San Francisco were closed down when AIDS first came out; in these bath houses 100 men in a daisy chain performed unprotected sex on one another.  S2 retorts that S1 is relying on rumors and misinformation, and since he doesn't have proof of the claim he shouldn't make it.  He states that its comments like these that characterizes a homophobic bigot, where the actions of a small group of gays in California are being equated to the behaviors of all gays.

S1 and S2 are discussing gay marriage and S2's opposition to it.  S1 feels remarks made by S2 point more to his being a bigot rather than simply opposing gay marriage.  S2 makes reference to a Yahoo search producing information of gay bath houses operating in San Francisco saying 100 males in these places are practicing unprotected sex on one another and this is wrong.  S1 contends the remark pertaining specifically to 100 men shows this information is based more on opinion than fact.  S1 urges S2 to read the article he cited to which S2 responds what is being done in one community to re-open gay bath houses has no bearing on whether or not gay marriages should be permitted.

S1 thinks a better comparison is Sodom. He argues that 100 men in a daisy chain performing unprotected sex on one another would be in comparison to Sodom. Everyone else should condemn it. He informs S2 of the bathhouses that can be looked up, they were shut down when AIDS first came out and are flourishing once again. He then asks S2 to go to a cite link to see how gays are trying to reopen bath houses in San Francisco.
S2 argues that S1's comments make him a bigot. He then proclaims that he just doesn't believe anything that S1 is saying. He determines that S2 is making claims without any proof and he wants the claims justified or taken back, then calls S1 irresponsible.

S1 compares gays to Sodom and justifies it by saying there are bath houses in San Francisco with 100 men performing unprotected sex on each other. He doesn't think it is homophobic, but rather, a fact. He believes they were closed down when AIDS came about but are being opened again. He states it can be found by Google search. S2 thinks this is rumors and misinformation. He questions if S1 got the information from Focus on the Family. He thinks there is no proof of that and it's a homophobic opinion. He believes one should have proof of any claims they make. He furthermore believes that the things that went on in the 80's are not relevant to what today's society has going on.
