S1 believes that the divorce rate in the United States is blown out of proportion by the rate of very young people who get divorced and states that the percentage of people who have been married over five years drops dramatically. They also believe that homosexuals are more promiscuous than heterosexuals.
S2 believes that young people and young marriages aren't really the same thing, and that the real facts are that those who divorce do so more often within the first five years of marriage, regardless of age. They refute S1's argument by pointing out that heterosexual marriages still end in divorce around 50% of the time. They don't believe that homosexual relationships should compare to heterosexual marriages because only heterosexuals are legally allowed to marry.

S1 suggests that statistics on divorce rates are skewed by the high proportion of young people who end up getting divorces. He claims that the divorce rate drops significantly if you focus only on couples who have been marriage more than five years. He also claims that statistics show that homosexuals are more promiscuous than heterosexuals and that this would lead to a higher divorce rate for same-sex marriages. S2 argues that the age of the spouses is irrelevant and that more than half of all heterosexual marriages end in divorce and suggests that it would likely be no difference for same-sex marriages. He also rejects the comparison of promiscuity between heterosexuals and homosexuals by pointing out that only heterosexuals are legally allowed to marry.

Two people are discussing the rate of divorce among heterosexual couples versus that of gay couples.  S1 feels the divorce rate in the United States is severely overestimated while S2 adheres to the statistics that show heterosexual marriages end in divorce almost 50% of the time and of those divorces, most are in the first five years.  S1 feels the numbers are warped due to the large number of young couples who get married and then decide it was a mistake and get divorced.  S1 feels gay people are more promiscuous than heterosexuals.  S2 provides several cites several websites which show most divorces of hetero couples are due to adultery.  S1 refuses to view the articles calling them propoganda.

Two people are discussing the divorce rate in the US.  S1 contends that the high divorce rate is due to the high rate of young people who get divorced.  He states that the rate of people who get divorced who have been married over five years drops dramatially, and he states that statistics prove that gays in general are much more promiscuous then straight people.  S2 retorts by stating that young people and young marriage are not the same, and that couples in general who divorce do so more often in the first five years, regardless of age.  He also states that the heterosexual divorce rate is 50%, and heterosexuals are not better at staying together then people expect homosexuals to.

S1 thinks that the divorce rate among the young in the U.S. is actually dropping instead of rising, despite what everyone thinks or says. He admits that young people get divorced because they eventually realize that they made a mistake. Gays are all promiscuous which lead to high divorce rates, plus you can't compare gay couple relationships with straight relationships. The debate is ceased by stating that no one can actually know what percentage of the population of the U.S. is gay. S2 disagrees with the statements made and gives links to info which is related to. The GUEST thinks that heterosexual marriages end in divorce nearly fifth percent of the time and thinks straight couples are no better at staying together than gays are.
