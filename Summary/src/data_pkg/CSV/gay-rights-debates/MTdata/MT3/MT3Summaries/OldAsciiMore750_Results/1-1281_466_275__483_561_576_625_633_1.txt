S1 argues that Biblical prophecy is not proof of America heading in the wrong direction from a religious perspective. S2 notes that the number of earthquakes seen in the last century have increased dramatically, providing evidence to the contrary. S1 argues that a pre-existing religious belief is necessary for any evidence regarding earthquakes to be relevant. S1 argues that religion should be excluded from determining the cause of common events. Further, if God is willing to cause earthquakes because people accept homosexuality but ignores greater tragedies, then God's ultimate benevolence is up for question. All that is required is that enough people want to accept homosexuality for such acceptance to be socially correct. S2 states that S1 is purposefully misunderstanding S2's statements and that God's motivations are ultimately unknowable. S2 argues that S1 is claiming to know the nature of homosexuality and God alike without being an expert on the situation. S2 then asks why gays should be considered acceptable but polygamists are not. S1 admits he sees no problems with polygamy being allowed either.

S1 argues that the bible warning of wars and natural disasters is not viable proof nor an argument since wars and natural disasters will always happen. They believe that it is within the majority's best interest to look out for the minority, as the minority still has a great number of people. They state that they haven't been argued that religious beliefs condone homosexuality, but that religious beliefs shouldn't have anything to do with another person's individual life. They refute the idea that earthquakes are a divinely inspired event. They also believe that genetics has more to do with homosexuality and alcoholism than choice or upbringing.
S2 believes that since the number of earthquakes have increased outside of Israel over the past one hundred years, that it is a sign of God's love waxing cold. They believe that the way the United States government works is through the majority until something is viewed as unconstitutional. They argue that genetics does not have anything to do with homosexuality since they also don't believe that alcoholism is genetic.

S1 dominates the debate.  He is against using religion, specifically Biblical references in the conversation around gay marriage.  His first comment seems to be arguing against a previous mention of increased earthquakes and wars.  He also argues for the inclusion and support of minority issues despite the fact that we live in a majority rule state.  He argues that first, most people fall into some sort of minority classification and second the minorities are still large in number.  There is a change in the conversation about half way through to genetics in which compares sexuality to a predisposition for alcoholism.  In the end he feels marriage must be consensual and that any parties may be free to leave, whether it is traditional, homosexual or polygamy.
S2 mostly argues the religious points, for example citing the increase in earthquakes outside of Israel in recent years though he mentions another name of who began the conversation around religion.  He questions why the debate remains around homosexuals and whether polygamists fall into similar categories in the genetic argument.

S1 claims that the Biblical prophecy that there will be wars and earthquakes in the future is not valid proof, that it is merely a recognition that people and nature continue to behave in the same way as time progresses. He rejects the idea that earthquakes have any relationship to people's behavior. He also claims that although the majority has the power to change the constitution, it is still in their best interest to support and accept minorities because they are a significant portion of society capable of swinging power between parties. 
S2 suggests that the number of earthquakes has increased in the past 100 years and that this is due to people's behavior. He claims that the majority is able to overrule the minorities as long as it does not violate the constitution. He rejects S1's comments about God's choice to kill people by drawing an analogy with different parenting styles, suggesting that people choose to raise their children in differently, so S1 should not be attempting to understand the reasons behind God's behaviors.

S1 claims that abortions and unwed couples have nothing to do with wars and earthquakes frequencies. S2 claims that earthquakes have increased exponentially outside of Israel and that the majority makes what ever rules it likes. S1 claims that is a religious argument about the earthquakes and either doesn't apply or if you are religious this isn't the right place to discuss it. S1 claims that making this a religious argument is not needed. S2 claims that references to a loving parent not killing some of their children are wrong. S2 claims that S1 claimed earthquakes are not a natural occurrence. S2 refutes that he stated that. S1 and S2 go back and forth arguing about refuting each other's refutations and inferences. S1 claims that polygamists and so on will want marriage rights now as well after homosexuals. S2 refutes the slippery slope argument.
