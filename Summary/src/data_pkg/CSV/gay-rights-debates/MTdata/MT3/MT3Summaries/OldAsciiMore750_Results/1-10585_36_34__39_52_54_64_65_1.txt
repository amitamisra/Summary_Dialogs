S1 asserts that the characters Bert and Ernie from Sesame Street at not homosexual partners. He suggests that homosexuals cannot understand how two men can be close without engaging in homosexual acts. He compares using Bert and Ernie as homosexual icons to using Kermit and Miss Piggy as a symbol for interspecies relationships. He argues that it is unfair for homosexuals to claim that they aren't sexual deviants when they are projecting deviant sex onto children's programs. He claims that homosexuals engage in deviant sexual practices and that they are attempting to project these behaviors onto Bert and Ernie under the pretense of them being married. He also claims that once same-sex marriage is legalized, it is possible that straight men will marry each other in order to gain some unspecified advantages.
S2 asserts that the argument currently being discussed is regarding marriage, not sexual behaviors of married couples. He claims that it is possible to represent two characters as homosexual without invoking sexual behaviors, comparing this to portraying heterosexual characters without being sexually explicit.

S1 believes that Bert and Ernie are just two men who are really good friends and happen to live together. He feels that the homosexual deviants want to see Bert and Ernie as gay and is sickened by the hypocrisy of them saying that they don't feel that way. He feels that Kermit and Miss Piggy are not portrayed as being sexually active but that calling Bert and Ernie gay would automatically mean that they were. He also feels that if gay marriage were to be legalized then there would be some straight men who would find it to their advantage to get married to other men for the benefits.
   S2 refutes that he wants Bert and Ernie to be gay, and that he had never said anything like that, and that S1 should look at the false fallacy paradox that was mentioned earlier. He feels that S1 has a dirty mind for saying that that was what he had thought, pointing that it was S1 who brought up sexual topics in the first place. He refutes that he wanted anything to do with a sexual relationship on a kids program, just that there could be married couples on Sesame Street, straight or gay there wouldn't have to be any mention of sexual situations.

S1 doesn't believe that Bert and Ernie are homosexual, and that homosexuals cannot understand that two men can be close friends without desiring sex with each other. This person believes that it wasn't the creators' intentions for it to be taken that way. They believe homosexuals want to interject what they believe to be deviant sexual practices into children's programming. They believe there is no distinction between homosexuality and sexual relations, and that one cannot be homosexual without practicing intercourse with one's own gender. They believe that when people discuss homosexual marriage that they are trying to disguise what they believe to be deviant sexual activity by using the word marriage.
S2 argues against S1 by stating that heterosexual marriages can be portrayed without sexual relations being alluded to or mentioned. They believe that heterosexuals and homosexuals can discuss marriage without ever needing to get into the details of sexual activity or even touching the topic of sexual activity. They don't agree that when one discusses marriage that they are also trying to discuss sexual activity.

S1 believes that S2 wants Bert and Ernie to be gay and that this will sexualize them to children because gay men engage in "deviant" sexual behavior. S1 argues that you could have Bert and  Ernie be straight and get married and this will not sexualize them. S1 states that S2 wants Bert and Ernie to be described to children as engaging in deviant sexual behavior but under the guise of "married".
S2 points out that the show is a work of fiction and that he merely said marriage and that S1 is who brought sex acts into the equation. He states that straight people are portrayed to children and it has nothing to do with their sex life. He merely thinks that having two male characters who are married will help support gay inclusion.

S1 finds the argument that Bert and Ernie could be homosexuals extremely offensive arguing that characters created for children's programs should not be sexualized at all. This leads into the topic of gay marriage and gay sex which he labels as deviant.  He questions whether two straight men would marry simply for the benefits of marriage if same sex marriage was legalized.  He accuses S2 and other homosexuals of wanting Bert and Ernie to have a same sex marriage, which would include "playing with their genitals".
S2 never comes out and says he believes Bert and Ernie are gay but argues for them to be allowed to be in a same sex relationship.  Throughout his arguments he differentiates between the relationship and sexual behaviors.  He mentions other relationships in children's programs like Kermit and Miss Piggy and the lack of sexualization when dealing with couples of the opposite sex.  He refutes S1's claims that men will marry with the idea that they already can marry women and would not have to get into a same sex relationship to get the benefits of marriage.
