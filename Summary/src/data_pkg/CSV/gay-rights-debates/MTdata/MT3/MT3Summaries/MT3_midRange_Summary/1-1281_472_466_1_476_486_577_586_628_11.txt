S1 claims that the number of earthquakes occurring outside of Israel has increased in the last hundred years, comparing 20 large earthquakes in the latter half of the 20th century to only 15 large earthquakes in the first half of the 20th century, and only 7 large earthquakes in the entire 19th century. S1 argues that this information is clear evidence that the frequency of earthquakes is increasing over time. S2 refutes S1 claim of increasing earthquake frequency, suggesting that the greater number of earthquakes detected could be a matter of increases in our ability to detect earthquakes rather than an actual increase in the number of earthquakes occurring. S1 takes this point into consideration, but claims that the evidence still supports his original claim.

S1 argues that the number of earthquakes has been increasing in recent times, citing statistics for larger earthquakes suggesting the frequency of large earthquakes increased five fold from the 19tyh to 20th centuries.  The context of the discussion may be religious as S1 mentions Israel as well as the U.S. Constitution and rights of minorities versus majority rule.  S2 seems exasperated with S1's comments here and in prior posts and suggests that advances in detection technology and increases in recording practices could explain any seeming increase in the frequency of earthquakes, and that S1 is merely looking at statistics unscientifically to support the assertion.  S1 is confident she accounted for the variables mentioned by S2 by limiting her argument to large earthquakes.

Two people are discussing the increase in frequency of earthquakes.  S1 contends that the amount of earthquakes in the last century is increasing exponentially.  He contends that there has been 20 large earthquakes in the latter half of this century, compared to about 15 for the first half and about 7 in the entire 19th century. S2 retorts that the method used to detect and record earthquakes have been taking exponential leaps forward, and he states that S1 is taking statistics from one source without critical thought an accepting it as fact.  S1 rebuts stating that the new methods detect minimal or localized earthquakes and that major ones can be detected without a seismograph.

S1 discussed the increase in earthquakes outside of Israel in the last 100 years and said it is "love waxing cold."  He noted that there have been 20 large earthquakes just in this part of the century that were easy to detect even without a seismograph . He said he did other research which showed the same results even when that was taken into account. He said that he knows that he differs with S2 as he believes that the majority rules in the United States  unless it violates the constitution . S2  said that he felt like shaking something at S2 and then asked S1 about the advances in the recording of the earthquakes and challenged his source and his statistics. He also challenged S1's earthquake argument.

S1 notes that the number of earthquakes outside Israel has increased I the last one hundred years exponentially. He or she quotes the lists of "World's Most Dangerous Earthquakes and Selected Earthquakes in the United States" from the Citizen's Guide to Geologic Hazards. He or she notes about twenty large earthquakes globally in the latter half of the century compared to about fifteen for the first half of this century and only seven large earthquakes recorded in the entire nineteenth century. They believe that the United States Government is ruled by the majority until it violates the constitution. 
S2 refutes this by stating that technological advances in earthquake tremor detection has improved greatly since the nineteenth century, and that S1's argument purposefully excludes this fact.
