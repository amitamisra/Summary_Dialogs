S1 claims that the debate over same-sex marriage has nothing to do with marriage equality because allowing homosexuals to marry would require redefining the meaning of marriage which is unacceptable. He argues that marriage is an institution that was created to be a union between a man and a woman with the intention of creating children as part of stable nuclear families. He also suggests that homosexuals are abnormal and are trying to convince themselves that they are normal by changing the law to allow themselves to get married. S2 claims that redefining marriage might not be a bad idea and claims that preventing a homosexual from marrying the person of their choice is discrimination. He also suggests that S1's opinions do not match reality.

S1 maintains a fundamental view of marriage as being between a man and a woman and as having been create to have children in a stable environment.  Gay marriage, S1 believes, would change the very nature of the marriage relationship, while merely providing gay men the ability to wear wedding rings and delude themselves that they are normal married people, although he concedes the latter part is only his opinion.  S2 argues that excluding gays from being able to marry the person of their choice is discrimination.  S1 argues that discrimination and equality are inappropriate terms because the very concept of marriage excludes homosexuals.  He regrets that more gay posters in the forum do not agree with him on the point.

Two people are discussing gay marriage.  S1 states that it has nothing to do with marriage equality, but an attempt to redefine the meaning of marriage.  He wishes that the gay posters would be honest and not use words such as equality and discrimination where they don't apply, since marriage is an institution created to be a union between man and woman that leads to the creation of children.  He states that marriage has nothing to do with two people giving each other a wedding ring.  S2 retorts by questioning how it is not discrimination if he can't marry the person of his choice but a heterosexual can. He also states that Las Vegas itself refutes S1's arguments.

S1 states that allowing gays to marry redefines the meaning of the word marriage because marriage was created to be union between a man and a woman that leads to child rearing within " a stable nuclear family". He further said this has nothing to do with gays. It has nothing to do with guys giving each other rings and kidding themselves that they are "normal like straight people. "
S2  questioned S1 asking him why he believes that that redefining marriage is a bad thing. He then said that if he cannot marry who he wants but a straight person can, it is discrimination. He said that he could not define it as anything else. He said S1 was never in Los Vegas.

S1 does not believe the argument has to do with marriage equality, and has everything to do with redefining the very meaning of marriage to allow homosexuals to marry. This person does not believe that equality and discrimination are valid opinions in support of homosexual marriage. They believe that marriage was instituted for the purpose of a stable nuclear family to procreate and that homosexuals have no place in such an institution. This person does not believe homosexuals to be normal, and believe that heterosexuality is normal.
S2 argues that it is, in fact, discrimination, because they cannot marry the person of their choice, but a heterosexual person can. This person does not believe that this is equality, and that it is not fair to them.
