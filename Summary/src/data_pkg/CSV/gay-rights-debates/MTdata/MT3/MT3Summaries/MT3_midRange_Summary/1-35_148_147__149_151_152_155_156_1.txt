S1 does not believe that most Christians are trying to ban homosexual unions, and that those accusing them of doing so are doing so falsely. They believe that homosexual lobbyists have gone beyond being defensive and are actively attempting to attack evangelical Christiandom falsely in order to justify their arguments.
S2 believes that the majority of self-identified Christians in the United States in fact, do oppose civil unions for homosexual citizens. However, they point out that in other countries such as Spain, they might not, but in general, the belief is the same globally. They refute S1's claims that they are not trying to ban homosexual unions by pointing out that the state constitutional amendments being passed are intended to preclude same-sex marriage and civil unions.

S1 claims that most Christians are not actively attempting to ban homosexuality and supports this claim by citing the fact that Evangelical Christendom as a whole is rarely ever united on anything, so they could not all be opposed to homosexuality. He proposes that gay lobbyists have crossed the line from counter-attacking to simply attacking Christians. S2 argues that most Christians do oppose same-sex marriage, civil unions, gay adoption, and anti-discrimination laws. To support this point, he cites the various state constitutional amendments that ban same-sex marriage and civil unions. He also suggests that this opinion on the topic of homosexuality is unique to America, claiming that Evangelical Christians in Spain are not actively opposed to civil unions despite sharing the same religious belief systems.

Two people are discussing gay marriage.  S2 feels Christians are trying to, in a sense, ban gay people by banning all activities pertaining to gays such as marriage, civil unions, and gay adoption.  S1 feels this is not the case and that most Christians don't treat gay people in this fashion.  S1 also feels the issue at hand is not being discussed as the forum began with speaking about the gay pride industry.  S2 supports his theory by citing the constitutional amendment to ban both gay marriage and same sex civil unions.  He feels this is the Christian equivalent of banning gay people by oppressing their lifestyle.  S1 feels this is a weak argument which gay lobbyists have overused.

Two people are discussing whether or not Christians want to ban gay people.  S1 contends that most Christians are not trying to ban the decriminalization of same-sex, it was just an accusation made.  He contends that evangelicals are rarely united for anything, let alone banning gay people.  He also states that gay lobbyists have long stepped over the line of simply counter-attacking with their defense.  S2 retorts by stating that a majority of self-identified Christians in the U.S. oppose civil marriage for gay people, among other things such as civil unions, gay adoptions and anti-discrimination laws.  He states that in Spain, they don't do that, and he points out a state constitutional amendment trying to prevent same-sex marriage.

S2 thinks that most Christians in this country oppose civil marriages for gay rights. Evangelical Christians have been opposed and do speak out against gay marriage. They go on to announce that a state constitutional amendment is being passed to preclude same sex marriage and civil unions. That means that same sex couples will be seen in the same light as straight couples. S1 defends the Christians by stating that they do not try to discriminate on gay marriages, and says that they aren't trying to ban gay marriage. the GUEST thinks it is laughable to think that they are that united in one particular event or fight together for good. They think that the GUEST has blown the whole conversation out of proportion.
