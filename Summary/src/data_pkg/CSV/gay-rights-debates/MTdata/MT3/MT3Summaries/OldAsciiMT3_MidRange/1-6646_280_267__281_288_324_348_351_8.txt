S1 points out that his heteronormative family represents the norm and suggests that deviation from the norm in the form of homosexual families is perverse. He clarifies that he doesn't hate gays, but he simply doesn't believe that the definition of marriage should be changed to include homosexual unions. He claims that S2's beliefs do not make him correct.
S2 suggests that deviation from the norm is simply a form of diversity and is not necessarily perverse. He accuses S1 of hating homosexuals. In response to S1's claims that he does not hate homosexuals, S2 points out that calling homosexual relationships perverse is clearly a form of hate, and that it is clear from S1's language that he does in fact hate people who are homosexual.

S1 thinks he and his family represents what is normal. Homosexuality in his opinion is a deviation from the norm and is perverse. He rejects the idea that he hates gay people and says he simply doesn't think we should redefine marriage for them. He states S2 may believe as wishes even if it is wrong. S2 questions what is perverse. He equates the word perverse with diversity. A deviation for the norm in his opinion is diversity. He doubts S1 is against diversity so he thinks he simply hates a form of it, gay people. He views calling something perverse ad evidence of this hate and does not believe S1 when he says that he doesn't hate gays he is simply worried about marriage.

S1 and S2 are discussing gay relations and the possibility of redefining marriage to include the gay community.  S1 believes gay relationships are a perversion of the normal thought of society.  S2 contends that S1 hates gays and is basically prejudice toward gay people based upon some remarks being made.  Particularly the label of perversion.  S2 contends that S1 is not against all diversity, just gay lifestyle which in S2's opinion makes him/her hateful toward gays.  S1 contends he/she does not hate gays but doesn't feel marriage should be redefined to allow for them to wed.  S2 feels S1's objection to gays and the family's they would make is prejudice.  S1 contends S2 is wrong in his/her beliefs.

S1 expressed his opinion that his family and other heterosexual families are the norm and that homosexual families (like S2's) deviate from the norm. He called such families "perverse". When this comment resulted in a challenge from S1 he denied hating gays. He then stated his opinion that that marriage should not be redefined for gay people... He continued to deny his hate for gays. S2 stated his belief that deviations from the norm are diverse. He said that he knew that S2 is not against all diversity but seems to be very much against gays. He bristled against S1's definition of his family as "perverse" and pointed at the use of that word as being illustrative of S1's hatred of gays.

Two people are discussing diversity and gays. S1 contends that his family represents the norm, not a deviation from it.  He calls gays a perversity, then states that he doesn't hate gays but rather believes that  marriage should not be redefined for them.  S2 contradicts, stating gays are a diversity, not a perversion, and that S1 hates gays.  He questions how S1 can claim that he doesn't hate gays when he clearly calls him and his family a perversion.  He then states that although he is younger than S1, he wasn't born yesterday, to which S1 replies that he (S2) can believe what he wants, no matter how wrong he is.
