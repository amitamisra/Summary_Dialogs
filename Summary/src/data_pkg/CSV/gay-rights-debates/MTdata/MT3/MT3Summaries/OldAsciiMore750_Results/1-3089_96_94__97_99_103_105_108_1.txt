S1 feels that there is a silent majority of people who appose gay marriage, and that they have spoken in the polls by electing Bush and not Kerry for president. He uses the argument that Bush had a wider margin of victory over Kerry than Clinton had in either of his elections. He notes that Ohio passed a Gay Marriage amendment and then elected Kerry was smashed in the Ohio presidential election, and credits this to the silent majority. He states that It is the silent majority that make the polls used by the left wing media indicating that the presidents approval rating is down, the economy is bad, the war in Iraq is going badly. He feels that morals and the gay marriage issue played a large role in the presidents victory.
   S2 states that the people of Ohio were equally as vocal about their views on gay marriage and their choice for president as any one else, and are therefore not a silent majority. He notes that while Clinton won by fewer total votes, he carried a larger percentage of votes, and therefore had a greater amount of support than Bush. He feels that due to the polls being accurate going into the election the term silent majority does not apply. While he notes that the majority's desire to suppress the minority likely played a  role in Bush's victory, polls suggest that in was a very small role.

S1 feels that the silent majority in Ohio spoke out about the issue of the state's passing of a gay rights amendment, and compares it to the large percentage of voters in past presidential elections. He believes that the morals and beliefs in the state were the reasons for the Republican presidential candidate, George Bush, winning by a larger percentage than either democratic candidate, John Kerry and Bill Clinton, in the past elections. 

S2 rebuts that the majority of people in Ohio were not silent about their views on gay marriage or on their choice for president; the people in that state were very vocal about their views. He states that Bush did win by a larger percentage than Clinton, the increase in population was the determining factor for those numbers. He feels that majority's desire to oppress the minority, in Ohio, did play some factor in Bush's win. He uses percentages from various candidates, likeClinton, Bush, Dole, Kerry and Gore to back up his argument. He disagrees that Bush was more supported than Clinton.

S1 notes that although John Kerry was expected to win the election in Ohio, he lost. He attributes this loss to the disapproval of homosexuality by Ohioans, as indicated by the passing of a gay marriage amendment and their support for President Bush who he claims won by a larger margin than President Clinton. S2 rejects the claim that the people of Ohio were silent about their views of same-sex marriage and claims that although President Bush won with a larger margin, President Clinton still won by a larger percentage, due to the increased population and larger voter turnout in President Bush's election. S1 claims that population is irrelevant, citing several statistics showing a low level of support for President Clinton, and also claims that the same-sex marriage issue definitely had an effect on the outcome of the Ohio election. S2 again responds with statistics showing that President Clinton won by larger percentages than President Bush. He does not deny that the same-sex marriage issue was relevant, but denies that there was a silent majority.

S1 believes that since Ohio passed a Gay Marriage amendment, it was the silent majority speaking the same as when President Bush was re-elected by a large margin. This person believes that morals and homosexual marriage had a large bearing on the election's eventual outcome. S1 believes that because of the silent majority, Kerry was confident in his victory in the polls in Ohio, when in fact he did not win in that state.
S2 does not believe that the voters of Ohio were silent in any manner regarding the issue of homosexual marriage or their choice for president. S2 believes that even though Bush won by a larger margin than Bill Clinton, it doesn't mean that Clinton did not win by a larger percentage. This person believes that population increases and higher voter turnout is what won President Bush the election. They explain that despite percentages being relatively low for the two primary candidates during President Clinton's election periods, the difference in the elections was that there was a competent third party running in both.

S1 believes in a conservative silent majority that negates liberal or left polling and votes in a politically correct and like minded conservative fashion in order to defeat liberal agendas such as gay marriage.  S2 doesn't think the conservatives are silent and they both cite various election results from the past to debate the premise that there is a silent conservative majority.  S2 doesn't believe there is a silent conservative majority and offers statistics to suggest that President Clinton was better supported by the electorate than President George W. Bush.  S1 is clearly a republican and repeatedly refers to President Clinton as "Slick Willie", whereas S2 is somewhat more guarded about his party affiliation in an apparent attempt to argue the matter from a point of neutrality, both asserting Clinton's superior level of support over Bush, and simultaneously implying that he, S2, is not a Clinton supporter.  S1 argues that Kerry expected to win Ohio and that the silent majority surprised him.  S2 replies that Kerry wasn't so sure he was going to win Ohio.
