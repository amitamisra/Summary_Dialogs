S1 and S2 are discussing the issue of marriage equality.  Both subjects seem to be on the fence with the issue.  S1 cites that eight of nine supreme courts have contended same sex marriage to be unconstitutional.  S2 questions how gay marriage would violate someone's constitutional rights.  S1 advises the bulk of the arguments were based on state constitutions which mirror the federal constitution.  S2 uses the example of Massachusetts' allowing gay marriage under its state constitutional law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation.  S1 contends there is no such piece to the Massachusetts constitution.  S2 then concedes he was incorrect about the citing and the law actually banned only discrimination based on gender and not sexual orientation.

S1 stated that eight out of nine state supreme courts have found that disallowing same sex marriage is unconstitutional and these states had constitutions which are similar to the U.S. Constitution. There continues to be the dual nature of marriage with the courts having to decide about it legally. Now the religions have to interpret it as they will. He closed with, " Gay rights is a real test of our constitutional system , and , so far , we're not passing with flying colors."
S2 questioned if they found that it violated their State constitutions alone or if it was the violation of the Federal Constitution that mattered in these cases. Many state constitutions guarantee rights that aren't in the federal constitution .

S1 states that the majority of the supreme court cases which have addressed a ban on same-sex marriage have deemed the laws unconstitutional. He recognized the difficulty imposed by the fact that marriage is both a legal contract and a religious ceremony. He claims that although the cited cases involved state constitutions, the ruling were based on provisions very similar to the federal constitution. 
S2 argues that supreme court decisions regarding violations of state constitutions are irrelevant to the federal constitution. He claims that the Massachusetts ruling was based on a provision prohibiting discrimination based on sexual preference which is not found in the federal constitution, but later admits that he was in error and that it was based on prohibiting discrimination based on sex.

Two people are discussing gay marriage and the Ccnstitution.  S1 contends that eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue has ruled banning same-sex marriage unconstitutional, based on their state constitutions that closely parallel the federal one.  He states that the nature of marriage is both legal and religious, and that the courts only deal with the legal aspect.  S2 states that the Massachusetts ruling was based on a specific provision in their constitution that prohibits discrimination based on sexual discrimination, which is not founded in the federal constitution, to which S1 states the ruling was on the equal protection grounds.  S2 then states that many state constitutions guarantee rights that aren't in the federal constitution.

S1 believes marriage to be both a legal contract as well as a religious ceremony and thinks the government and society is stuck in this duality. He thinks the courts must deal with this and different religions may do as they wish. Winning argument from states that declared banning gay marriage unconstitutional, he says, are based on state constitutional provisions that closely follow the federal constitution. He thinks gay rights are a real test of the constitutional system. S2 thinks that violating a state constitution has nothing to do with the federal one and that many state constitutions give rights, such as prohibiting discrimination against gays, that the federal one does not grant. He thinks it should always be clear which constitution is being discussed.
