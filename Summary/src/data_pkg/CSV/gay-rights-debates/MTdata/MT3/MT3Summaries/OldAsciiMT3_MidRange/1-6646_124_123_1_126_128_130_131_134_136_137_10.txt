S1 challenges S2 to debate the cause of the spread of AIDS in the United States and encourages S2 to attempt to challenge his claims with proof that they are untrue. He accuses S2 of attempting to change the debate and making personal attacks rather than addressing the question at hand. He suggests that if the debate occurs, he will prove his assertions true.
S2 claims that the origin of AIDS in the United States is unknown and that the spread of AIDS was caused by unclean needles, unprotected sex, and contaminated blood transfusions. He rejects the requirement that he should provide proof for his claims by citing S1's failure to do so. He suggests that once S1 begins to debate appropriately, then he will too.

S1 believes that gay people are the ones that made AIDS a major health concern in the US and asks for proof to the contrary. He thinks S2 is simply giving opinions and not facts and when he quotes him S1 says he is flattered that a quote from him is the best intelligent statement he could come up with. He wishes to debate S2. S2 believes no one knows how AIDS came to the US and states that people using dirty needles, those participating in unsafe sex, and those involved in blood transfusions before they knew how it was spread were the ones that made it a health concern. He quotes S1 as evidence of his hypocrisy in requesting evidence when he offers none.

S1 and S2 are discussing the onslaught of AIDS in the United States.  S1 believes the disease was made into a huge health concern as the result of the homosexual community. S2 contends no one really knows how AIDS originally arrived in the United States and the fault of the spread lies with the folks who used dirty needles when taking drugs and people who didn't practice safe sex.  S2 also cites the practice of untested blood transfusions before it was discovered how AIDS could be spread.  S1 argues that S2 has provided no substantial proof to back his/her arguments in regard to how the disease actually rose to concerning levels in America and asks for a debate between he/she and S2.

S1 said that he continues to "stand by" and adhere to his previous post. He challenged S2 to show proof that this was not the case (seeming that gays caused AIDs to be a major health concern) and to stop making empty arguments and/or attacking him. He impatiently waited for the proofs he wanted.
S2 stated his belief that it remains a mystery about how AIDs reached the United States and that IV drug users who exchanged needles without cleaning them and those who did not practice safe sex and those who gave blood for transfusions before AIDS was known about spread the disease. He said that he would not debate S1 until S1 starts himself giving the proofs that he requests of others.

Two people are discussing the spread of AIDS.  S2 states that no one knows how AIDS got to the US.  He also states that those who made AIDS a major health are the people who didn't clean their needles while doing drugs, those who don't practice safe sex, and those giving blood transfusions before it was a known form of transmission.  S1 rebuts, asking S2 to provide evidence to back up his claim.  S2 then quotes a recent post from S1, stating that any debate will start when S1 owns up to his own requirements and defend his statements, to which S1 guaranteers that he can prove his assertions, as long as S2 accepts his challenge to a debate.
