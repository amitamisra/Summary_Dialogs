S1 replies to Matthew (who had asked about voting on his civil rights), that there are legal and legislative processes that need to take place to determine civil rights, that legislators, elected officials, and the people of our country all are required to vote for change to take place. He notes that this process has happened before and that protesting had made a difference, but not until enough people had gotten on board with the issue. He feels that this process has to be there in some form to determine the status of civil rights and how those rights are expressed.
   S2 feels that by explaining how legislation works in this country S1 has moved the topic away from the question Matthew had asked. He does not feel that the people voting on laws, legislators voting on laws, or the people electing politicians, are the same thing. He takes issue with S1 derailing the topic away from the question. He takes further issue with the idea that the masses should be allowed to vote on civil rights issues, calling this stupid and wrong. He feels that if a group's civil rights need protecting, then they need protecting from the group doing the voting. He believes that if the power of the government can be used to fight evil and prejudice than it should be.

S1 feels that issues involving legislative movements are decided by society. Though the legislature votes on national issues, the power of the citizens is what grants or denies civil rights legislation. He feels the hot issue right now involves gay marriage, and the outcome of that issue will be a voting matter. According to him, society determines its own standards and it is not possible to make gay marriage civil rights matter. Legal marriage cannot just be handed out to any group that calls for it; society determines the facts and acts reasonably and accordingly to the facts given about the issue.

S2 feels that civil rights issues should not be left up to society, especially if that society is the main deterrent in approving a group's rights.  He states that the government should be the force behind protecting citizens' rights against the hatred and bigotry of the masses. The government has involved itself in civil rights issues in the past, and should step up to defend gay rights when it comes to legal marriage.

S1 claims that any legislative movement requires the support of the people to be successful. He suggests that the legal decisions about important issues involve not just the legislature, but national debates and protests. He argues that this same process is now occurring over gay rights and that people voting on laws is how the legal system works in order to allow society to determine its own standards. He claims that there is no problem with marriage being redefined to include same-sex couples, but that this change of definition must occur through the official process. 
S2 accuses S1 of shifting off topic to the voting process and how the legislature works, claiming that the legal intricacies are irrelevant. He claims that allowing the general public to determine civil rights is wrong and that if a group needs protecting it is the government's job to do so, citing instances in the past where the government has taken a stand against bigotry. He argues that just because something is currently legal doesn't mean that it isn't wrong.

S1 believes that protesting made a difference, but not until enough people had grouped together to voice their opinion. They point out that despite protesting, change would not be brought about unless the will of the people was not desiring that change. They believe this is how the system works, and any legislation is a matter of voters and the will of elected officials to reflect what the voters desire. They believe that the true reason behind the ballot initiatives is to determine whether or not it is a civil right in the first place to give legal marriage to whatever group arrangement is in question.
S2 believes that there is a difference between voters voting on laws and legislators voting on laws. They do not believe that it is a good thing to allow the majority vote on civil rights issues because if a minority needs protecting, it will need protection most from the majority that is trying their best to keep them down. They do not believe society should be allowed to be bigoted.

S1 and S2 are discussing the political processes that may lead to gay marriage.  S2 is of the opinion that society and government failure to recognize gay marriage and provide it equal protection is a civil rights violation being carried out against a minority group, implicitly suggesting that it should be protected under the Constitution by the Courts.  S1 on the other hand believes the issue is one that needs to spend time in the public awareness and consideration and be realized over time in the results of various political processes such as election results, initiatives in State legislatures and ballot initiatives.  S2 complains that this is obfuscation and an attempt by S1 to avoid the rights violation issue.  S2 disagrees and notes that just calling something a violation or stupid or wrong doesn't advance the process, and defies S1 to draw appropriate lines on where to draw the line, such as with regard to protection of other less acceptable group intimate relationships.  S2 asserts that the government has protected minorities against bigotry in the past.
