S1 identifies the important spiritual situation that homosexuals are in. He suggests that it is inappropriate to make jokes about homosexual lifestyles, that no one approves of the deviant behaviors practiced by homosexuals, and that it would not be funny if homosexuality was discovered in your own community. S2 claims that sexual behaviors because we do not identify non-homosexuals by the sexual behaviors they engage in, we should not do so for homosexual individuals. He argues that a person's private behaviors are no one else's business, and that a sexual behaviors do not define who someone is as a person. He defends homosexual behaviors by referencing the deviant behaviors performed by heterosexuals, suggesting that deviant sexual acts are not the sole province of homosexuals.

S1 believes those who practice gay relationships are spiritually lacking and feels S2's sarcasm toward the issue at hand is proof of this.  S2 feels S1 is too literal and obsessed with the issue of gay sex rather than gay marriage.  S2 advises what happens in the bedroom is private and not the issue.  S1 makes some rude remarks in regard to gay sex involving gerbils.  S2 feels many heterosexuals also have a history of doing vulgar things as well and it is unfair to categorize only gay individuals in this manner.  S1 does not agree with this.

He states that their practices are sick and perverted and also unnatural.  S2 states that it was sarcasm, and he finds it funny that S1 was making jokes about inserting Gerbils into someone's rectum.  He also claims that sex is all that S1 thinks about since that is the only argument he comes up with.  He then contends that people do not define their neighbor or the people around them by what they do sexually, and that Americans could care less about others' sex life.

He believes homosexuals have created sick and perverted sexual practices, such as those involving gerbils, and they are in a dangerous spiritual situation because of it. He denies joking. S2 laughs sarcastically and questions if sex is all some people think about. He thinks no one cares what people do in their bedrooms because it is private and not a reflection of who they are as a person. He states that people do not define their neighbor or mailman based on what they do in their bedroom and that if that were the case there could be many negative comments made about S1. Also, S2 says that heterosexuals have been known to have messed up sexual practices as well.
