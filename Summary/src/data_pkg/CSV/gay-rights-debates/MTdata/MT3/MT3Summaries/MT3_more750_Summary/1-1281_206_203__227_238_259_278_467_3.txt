S1 believes that all laws are based on morals and that because the country of the United States is predominantly Christian, their laws will reflect those beliefs. They believe that by changing standards there is a harm to integrity. This person believes that everyone has equal rights in terms of religious beliefs, however behavior is regulated by government and as such society can only do anything in the name of religion until it violates behavior that is accepted by society. They argue that it is the people who determine what is in the public's best interest to protect and ban.
S2 argues that if the government allowed for people to believe in God, but made it illegal to put their beliefs into practice, such as going to church or private prayer at home, that it would be similar to the situation with homosexuals being unable to marry, and thus inequality. This person argues that this would not be equality and that S1 is using the letter of the law to twist the purpose of the law.

Two people are discussing the subject of gay marriage rights.  S1 is against gay marriage but adamantly states his objection is not based on religion but because there are laws prohibiting the practice.  S2 is in support of gay marriage and argues laws could also be passed to ban things such as worshiping God and begs the question of whether or not S1 would so adamantly support the laws he cites if that were the case.  S1 advises he would still support the law as there are already laws banning certain religious practices such as polygamy.  He advises that even though such a thing would most likely not happen, he would still support it because it would be fair and equal toward all.  S1 contends that if this were the case, crime rate would increase due to the banning of religious freedom, in a sense.  S1 believes homosexuality should be considered a crime because sodomy is a crime.  S2 feels S1 is distorting the law to justify homosexuals being discriminated against.  S1 denies this accusation.

S1: All laws are based on morals - Christian morals, as the U.S. was founded as a Christian country. By changing family standards by allowing gay marriage, the integrity of heterosexual marriage and family structure is no longer stable.  Prostitution, polygamy, human trafficking, gambling and drug distribution are all "consensual acts" as gay relations claim to be; should these be legalized too? Homosexuality is linked to crime, and many consider homosexuality to be harmful. Equality means treating everyone the same, but not treating every behavior the same. The people will determine what is in the public's best interest to protect and ban.

S2: What if belief in God was legally allowed, but worshiping in churches or even praying in private was illegal? A parallel to gay marriage - gay relations between two consenting adults is fine, but gay marriage is not. Acts like prostitution and drug trafficking are not equal exchanges, and are linked to crime; homosexuality is not. Equality means worshiping whomever you want, not what the majority believes is correct.

S1 claims that laws are based on morals and because the United States is a predominantly Christian nation, the laws are going to be biased toward Christian beliefs. He asserts that homosexuality has negative consequences and harms the integrity of marriage. He argues that people have the right to believe freely, but that the government controls behavior, citing the freedom of religion until the practices do not conform to society's rules. He brings up the issue of equality, claiming that different religions are not actually equal even though the law says they should all be treated equally because although each of the religions has the same rights, they are still not all treated equally.
S2 rejects S1's differentiation between the right to believe and the right to behave and says it is inappropriate to compare homosexuality to non-consensual behaviors. He claims that behaviors like drug trafficking and gambling have links to crime and should therefore be regulated, but that there is no reason to believe that homosexuality is harmful so it should not be controlled.

S1 Denies bringing up religion, someone else did. States freedom of belief is law but rules govern actions. Also that changing something frequently weakens its integrity. S2 Denies validity of S1's earlier arguments, as referencing that were not between consensual adults. Questions if freedom of religion were allowed but expression limited. S1 States many religious practices such as polygamy are illegal and that many other consensual acts such as drug use as well. S2 States that other banned activities are linked to crime directly but homosexuality isn't. S1 States that if sodomy is illegal then homosexuality is a crime. States that the people are equal not the religions they follow. S2 Refutes S1, denies any link between homosexuality and crime. Cites difference between the letter and intent of the law.  S1 States that equality is treating everybody the same, not every behavior. The people determine what is in the public's interest. States differences between state laws with prostitution, age of consent and references physical effects reported by doctors of homosexuality also links to serial killers.
