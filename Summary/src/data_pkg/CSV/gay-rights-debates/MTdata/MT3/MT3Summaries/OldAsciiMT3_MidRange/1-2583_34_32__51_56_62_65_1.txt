S1 does not believe that anyone outside of a heterosexual marriage should be considered a husband, wife or a spouse because legally they are not. This person believes that the term gay marriage is an oxymoron because marriage, legally, to them, is only between one man and one woman. They believe that prior to Roosevelt, society did not accept the idea of state welfare as constitutional, but because people were willing to sacrifice freedom for security, they eventually caved to his ideas.
S2 does not believe that marriage is simply between one man and one woman, and that the entire reason behind the debate is so that homosexual marriage can and will be legally recognized. They do not see a reason for discrimination against homosexual marriage.

S1 claims that gay husband, gay wife, and gay spouse are not legally recognized categories because homosexual unions do not meet the legal criteria for marriage, namely that it occurs between one man and one woman. He claims that because of this, many people view the term gay marriage as an oxymoron. He uses the example that a cat cannot be called a dog just because someone wants to. He admits, however, that there is a possibility that gay unions might eventually be recognized with the same rights as heterosexual unions. S2 asks why a homosexual union is not legally recognized. He claims that appealing to the traditional definition of marriage is circular reasoning and therefore insufficient to explain why homosexuals are being discriminated against.

S1 and S2 are discussing the topic of gay marriage.  S1 feels the term husband is not recognizable in a same sex relationship nor is the term wife.  S2 feels the only reason these terms are not recognized is because the couple is gay and gay marriage is not yet recognized legally.  S1 holds that the marriage is viewed legally as one man and one woman, not same sex; comparing the theory that a cat is not a dog simply because one chooses to call it so.  S1 also cites that according to the CBO, 600,000 gay couples would want to wed if legislation were passed to allow it.  S2 wants logical reasons for now allowing gays to marry.

Two people are discussing the legal definition of marriage.  S1 contends that terms such as gay husband, gay wife, and gay spouse are not legally recognized because they do not meet the legal criteria of one man, one woman.  He compares it to the fact that a cat doesn't meet the legal definition of a dog, and questions if we should change the legal definition of a dog just to appease the cat.  S2 contends that they are not legally recognized simply because they're gay, and it's circular reasoning.  He states that stating that marriage is heterosexual completely ends any debates, and he questions the logical reasons for marraige discrimination against gays and lesbians.

S1 agrees that when a husband is part of a heterosexual relationship a gay husband is not legally recognized in the same category. His statistics support the fact that 60,000 gay couples would get married if they were allowed. The equal rights aren't there when it comes to same sex marriage. Welfare is referenced when making a point about political muscle. American freedom never existed and no one can't argue that FDR's public opinion on the role on the federal government. S2 thinks that it is a problem because same sex marriage has never been legally recognizes is a big problem.  The debate is more for straight couples than it is about gay relationships. He notes that there are logical reasons for marriage discrimination.
