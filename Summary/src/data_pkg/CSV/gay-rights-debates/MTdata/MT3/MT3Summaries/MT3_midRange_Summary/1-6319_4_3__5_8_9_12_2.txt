S1 cites a key statement in the same-sex marriage legislation that allows marriage officers the right not to perform a same-sex marriage if it conflicts with their conscience, religion, or beliefs. He believes this is a good caveat, claiming that forcing officials to perform same-sex marriages would be infringing upon their religious freedom. He argues that if a public official had a religious objection to heterosexual marriages, then he would not expect that person to perform his marriage and would instead seek out someone who would. S2 believes it is inappropriate for public officials to be able to deny services based on their personal religious beliefs. If they are unable to do their job, he suggests, they should not be able to hold that position.

S1 and S2 are discussing the situation in which a marriage officiant may be requested to perform a gay marriage but have personal religious beliefs against homosexuality or gay marriage.  S1 defends and respects the personal religious beliefs and notes that the provision they are discussing (which is either a law or a proposed law) provides the marriage official with the ability to opt out of performing the ceremony if it violates his or her religious beliefs.  S2 finds that offensive, reasoning that if the person is licensed by the state to perform marriage ceremonies that person should do so for all marriages, not just heterosexual marriages.  S1 asserts that South Africa takes his view, while S2 claims Canada sides with him.

Two people are discussing marriage freedom and religious freedom.  S1 quotes a provision that states that marriage officers do not need to perform a ceremony between same-sex couples if it conflicts with their conscience, religion or belief.  He states that he would not want someone to be forced to do something against their religious beliefs, as if it were the case with his heterosexual civil ceremony, he would find someone else to do it.  He then states that marriage freedom shouldn't trump religious freedom.  S2 believes that all public officials are there to serve all members of the public equally under the law, and if one cannot do the job then he should look for another job.

S1 said that in South Africa it seems as if marriage freedom does not trump religious freedom as public officials do not have to perform a gay marriage ceremony if they believe that doing so would be against their values. He said that if a public official did not want to marry him in a heterosexual marriage he would want to go elsewhere rather than force him to do it. 
S2 said that public officials should serve the public equally under the law as that is what they are supposed to do. He said that they should have to look for another job if they do not want to do their jobs. He expressed his gladness at being in Canada where there are more rights.

S1 notes a provision in law that makes performing marriage ceremonies by sanctioned marriage officers non-mandatory when it comes to same sex couples and marriage as long as performing said ceremony would conflict with that person's conscience, religion and belief. S1 believes that forcing them to do so against their beliefs would infringe on their religious freedom. 
S2 feels that it is unfortunate if that applies to public officials, as they believe that public officials must serve the public in its entirety, equally, under the law. He or she feels that if one cannot perform the job, then that person should look for another job. This person believes that it is an impediment to the public servant performing his or her job if it's true.
