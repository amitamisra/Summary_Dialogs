S1 believes there is some merit in the comparison of arguments against interracial marriage and those against homosexual marriage. This person points out that many opponents of homosexual marriage use many of the same arguments those who opposed interracial marriage did. They also argue that those who oppose homosexual marriage do so for both religious and homophobic reasons. This person argues that the definition of words get frequently modified in some way and uses the example of the use of the word 'War' when referring to the Iraq War when Congress gave no official declaration of War. They argue that today a lot of military operations are automatically grouped under the word 'War'.
S2 does not believe that using examples of interracial marriage protests has relevance to the argument over allowing homosexual marriage. They argue that any separate marriage provision for Homosexuals should be as inclusive as Heterosexual marriages, but that the two should remain separate from each other by definition. They do not believe that the definition of marriage should change to include homosexual couples.

S1 seems to agree with the comparison between interracial marriage and same sex marriage, citing that many of the arguments against them are similar.  He believes that words can be redefined including the word marriage and uses war as an example.  He brings up the fact that war has not been declared since WWII but the country has been involved in war-like situations and typically these are referred to as war.  He sees this as being off topic but this debate ends up dominating the remaining part of the text.
S2 does not agree that marriage should be redefined to include same sex couples.  He does not believe himself to be a homophobe and cites friendships with gay individuals to back up his claim.  His issue is not with rights or the actual relationships themselves, he believes in full rights for gay couples, but he does not believe that the relationships should be able to bear the label marriage because it is not between a man and woman.  When the topic changes to the use of the term war he does not disagree with S1 but gives information challenging previous statements.

S1 argues that in spite of the vitriol employed, comparing interracial and gay marriage is a useful analogy. Opponents of gay marriage use similar arguments as those employed by opponents of interracial marriage. S2 argues that this comparison is irrelevant, he has not mentioned religion or interracial marriage in his opposition to gay marriage. In fact, none of the tropes associated with interracial marriage actually apply. He has instead argued that redefining marriage would require redefining several other cultural practices as well. He has also proposed that those seeking to enjoy same sex marriage are doing so out of some form of self-shame. S1 argues that words and associated cultural practices are redefined all the time, providing the example of "war" to illustrate his point. In comparison to these major re-definitions, redefining what constitutes a valid marriage seems minor in comparison. S2 brings up a counterpoint to S1's argument about war. S1 clarifies S2's argument about war to illustrate how S2's example is in accordance with S1's original statement. S1 stands by his previous counter-example.

S1 cites an article by a law professor which notes that opponents of gay marriage use many of the same arguments that were used by opponents of interracial marriage.  S2 claims she supports interracial marriage, provided it is heterosexual, and notes that she has not made inapplicable separate but equal arguments suggested by the analogy.   She purports to have gay friends and to be sympathetic to gay rights and civil unions but opposes gay marriage on the grounds that it does not meet her understanding of the word marriage.  S1 points out that she is using form over substance, and that the meaning or definition of marriage can change over time, noting that the public universally accepts and refers to the Irag War, despite the fact that the U.S. never declared war against Iraq, or Viet Nam or Korea either.  He suggests accepting an undeclared war as a war does less violence to the meaning of the term war than substituting a Jack for a Jill on a marriage license does to the term marriage.

S1 feels that Jim and MrWrite's argument has become a battle of insults, and that this is unfortunate, but that the comparison between the argument against gay marriage and that against interracial marriage is not baseless. He cites that opponents of gay marriage use many of the same arguments that were used to oppose interracial marriage, before that was outlawed. He believes that most opponents of gay marriage do so for religious or homophobic reasons. He argues that words get redefined on an ongoing basis, citing the word war being modified to suit political purposes. He does not believe that the justifications for the current war in Iraq have much merit, and that the same argument could be made for reentering Vietnam or Korea.
   S2 doesn't feel that interracial marriage and homosexual marriage have anything to do with each other. He feels that separate-but-equal would apply to the records of gay couples but wouldn't justify any restrictions of there rights or privileges as a couple. He preemptively denies being homophobic, citing his having gay friends who know what his views on the word marriage are. He does not feel that the Iraq War is technically a new war requiring all of the congressional steps, rather that it was merely a continuation of the Gulf War, or that the same arguments could be applied  to those other conflicts.
