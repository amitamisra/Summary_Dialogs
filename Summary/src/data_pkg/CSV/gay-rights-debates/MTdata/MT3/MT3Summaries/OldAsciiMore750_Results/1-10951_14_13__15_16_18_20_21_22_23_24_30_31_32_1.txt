S1 believes that all homosexuals are doomed to the fiery pits of hell, grouping them all together and calling them godless heathens. He is of the mind that it is his christian duty to inform them of this,as non of S1's brethren will. He feels that until some scholarly evidence is produced that refutes the resurrection of Christ, any non-believers are just noisy Christ deniers. He uses strong words, threats, and insults, to validate his argument, as well as a story on Fox news.
   S2 calls S1's entire argument into question, does not believe that he will be going to Hell, that it doesn't exist, and that there is no proof to the contrary. He feels that if proof of the resurrection of Christ existed it would have already been produced. He accuses S1 of dodging the argument and attempting to reverse the burden of proof, he calls this tactic pathetic  and uses Fox as proof of this point. He says that he does not think that insults and threats are an intelligent or useful form of debate.

S1 believes that all unrepentant homosexuals will spend an eternity suffering in Hell after they die.  He repeatedly cites Christianity and the Gospels as sources of information that back him up in this belief.  He challenges the other writer to prove the Gospels are fiction and that Christ's resurrection is false.  Failure to do so means failure to disprove that homosexuals will suffer forever in Hell.  He also says that President Obama's involvement with gay rights proves that Obama has no spiritual credibility.

S2 does not believe homosexuals will suffer forever in Hell after they die.  He does not believe proving his stance requires him to disprove the Gospels.  He suggests that whenever the other writer has no proof to offer, he relies on insults.  Further, he suggests the other writer's words and attitude are hypocritical in terms of Christian religious values.  In response to the President Obama reference, he focuses on the other writer's news source.  He doesn't believe Fox News is a credible news source, and sees its use as weakening the debate.

S1 insists that all those supporting or belonging to the homosexual community are going against the teachings of God from the Bible. He labels S2 and others like him as heathens, warning them to immediately change their ways and recognize Christ's authority; or else, fall into the Pit. He provides a link to an article about Obama's gay-marriage stance calling it madness. He the resurrection of Christ cannot be disproved. He insists until the resurrection is 'busted' they remain whiners and deniers of Christ.
S2 believes that the belief systems of Christianity are unfounded and demands to be shown evidence of God and other biblical assertions. He refers to Christian belief as fairytale and delusion. He ridicules S1 for his predictable debate style claiming that S1 lack of valuable argument is typical for all Christians when confronted with reality, thereby his position's validity is made for him. He insists that when confronted with the fact that as a Christian, belief must be accompany good deeds, S1 returns only insult and threats of eternal damnation.

S1 claims that people who support same-sex marriage and all other godless heathens will go to hell for their beliefs and behaviors and that God's mercy is the only thing keeping them out of Hell at the present time. He argues that if S2 believes the Gospels are fiction, then it should be simple to provide evidence against the resurrection, but that this evidence is not available because the Bible is true. He further claims that President Obama is a spiritual imbecile for supporting same-sex marriage and attempting to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and that anyone who supports him is also a spiritual imbecile. 
S2 accuses S1 of having poor rhetoric because he does not provide any evidence and resorts to using insults and threats and shifting the topic. He also attacks S1 for referencing Fox News as a source of information. He also points out that S1 claims he is going to Heaven because of his belief, but then cites several Bible verses suggesting that you must do more than just believe.
