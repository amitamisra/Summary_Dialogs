Hi Kevin,
I have summaries related to only one topic Gay Rights as I am currently just focussing on one topic.
As of  now I have 65  dialogs, each summarized by 5 different people.
Initially I had this task done by undergrads hence one batch of 15 dialogs has summaries in text files and other batched were run on mechanical turk
I'd send share them in google drive with 2 separate folders 
There are 
I'd explain there structure
Batch1, Batch2,Batch3
each contain text files. Each text file has summary of a dialog by 5 different people.
The dialogs for these files are present in the file
MT2_more750.csv.

MT2 and MT3 folders also contain text files with dialogues summarized by 5 different persons.
Dialogs for these files are in file  MT2/MT2_midrange.csv  and 
MT3/MT3_midrange.csv.
Filename  in folders MT2 and MT3 represents dialog keys, as there is a 1-1 mapping with file name and dialog keys  in csv files.

If you have any doubts or need any additional clarification, feel free to email me.


Thanks,
Amita
