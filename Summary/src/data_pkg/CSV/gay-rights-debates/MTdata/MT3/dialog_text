<br><b>S1:1-  </b>In the end you godless heathens will be in Hell and we'll be on the other side of the great divide looking down on your endless misery , just like in the story of the Rich Man and Lazarus . And you won't have to like it .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>None of us will have to like it , as it ain't gonna happen . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not only are you wrong , but you'll be dead wrong and won't be able to save yourself from the Pit .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Presumably you can provide unequivocal proof of this then . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You'll get your proof soon enough . You might even drop down into the Pit by morning , lest the mercy of the Lord keeps you for a later time .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Not going to happen . Nice to think that you are suggesting it might happen tonight , though . How jolly christian of you . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Darn right it's Christian of me . Who else is going to warn you to straighten up so you don't have to go to Hell , your Sodom and Gomorrah brethren ? Wise up .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Let's face it , you're just a bitter old coot who has nothing better to do than threaten people with baseless drivel . You don't frighten me . If you had the slightest bit of evidence , you would have presented it by now . You got nothing . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>< Flush > Listen , you stiff-necked heathen , if the Gospels were such a piece of rubbish that they look like a fairy tale to you , then it should be a piece of cake for you to bust the resurrection . But you can't . Not even with a lethal dose of Viagra can you muster up a decent argument . You never could . And until you do that you're in dire danger of dropping down into the Pit at any moment . Only the good graces of God continue to hold you up for a time . You're busted . And you'd better wise up while you can .<br><b> S2:5-  </b>That's it Easy , start with your usual ' flush ' , which we all know means you have no answer . Then get in with an insult , followed by an attempt to switch the burden of proof . And finish with a veiled threat . Your rhetoric truly is pathetic . <br><b>S1:6-  </b>What's pathetic is your lame-brain support for this kind of abomination : Obama , touting gay marriage stance , calls for repeal of Defense of Marriage Act Read more : http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012...#ixzz1utWOvU1C He's a spiritual imbecile , as are those who support his madness .<br><b> S2:6-  </b>No , what's pathetic is your tactic of dodging every argument . And the fact that you go to Fox for your news reinforces this . You claim that you have already passed over to the other side simply because you believe ( you have no evidence , but that has never stopped you ) . Then you provide several quotes from the bible that suggest that you need to do more than just believe , and actually have to do good deeds . When this is pointed out to you , you do a quick presto chango , avoid the debate , the insults start flying , and threats of eternal damnation abound . All this does is show that you have nothing other than a pathetic fairy tale based dillusion . You have no evidence , but haven't the guts to admit it . Unfortunately for you , you also don't have the brains to make a good debate of it . You just repeat the same old drivel , and revert to insults and threats - and your ' flush ' - when you have nothing intelligent to say ( which is just about every post ) . <br><b>S1:7-  </b>You've got nothing but your usual drivel , denials , whines , and unfounded conjecture . When you grow a pair of cojones and back it up with some credible arguments and credible scholarship that busts the resurrection of Christ , then you will have gained some credibility around here . Until then you're nothing more than a noisy little Christ denier .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What you are saying , Mr Taliban , is that we can not have a civil government contract because your of religious beliefs . You rail against the Mideastern countries for their treatment of Christians and sharia law , but you are so happy to impose that same sharia law upon us . You are just the same as the Islamists that you despise .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>He has not advocated the execution , imprisonment , or even mandatory therapy for homosexuals that is an unfair accusation . It is the homosexual lobby who are trying to force him and people like him to recognize homosexuality in the public sphere and thus condone and support it , and their reaction to that is the sum of the so called ' gay-bashing ' in modern western countries . That is why I could live in peace with easyrider but not a collectivist , he believes in freedom if only because the founders of the united states did . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>He is advocating that his religious beliefs be turned into laws that I have to live under . Yes he is the Taliban . Yes he wants sharia law imposed upon me and my family .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No , you want your relationship imposed upon him and his family . What religious belief is it that he wants as law ? That homosexuals should be put to death and their blood is on them ? He has not advocated that in all the posts he's made since I've been here . You think you have a right to public support and that is why you have a blindness to the nature of what he wants . Homosexual marriages have not been banned by any state , some refuse to recognize them and that is all . You can still sign any contract with anyone you want . You can still have as much sex as you want with whoever you want . There are no oppressive laws and the sooner you realize that the sooner we all can stop hearing this avalanche of self-absorbed entitled complaints . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It is his religious belief that a civil marriage contract is between a man and a woman . His religious belief is the law and he supports that law . It is a religious law that is no difference then sharia law . His religious beliefs should have nothing to do with civil law . Further my religious beliefs are being violated .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Then how can non-religious people ( like me ) recognize that man and woman has always been what marriage meant ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Because there is such a thing as a legal contract signed between two people and the state , simple as that .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You've got nothing but your usual drivel , denials , whines , and unfounded conjecture . When you grow a pair of cojones and back it up with some credible arguments and credible scholarship that busts the resurrection of Christ , then you will have gained some credibility around here . Until then you're nothing more than a noisy little Christ denier .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>LMAO .. I do believe that is the lamest reply you have ever produced .. It's apparent that you are frustrated and that might be throwing you off a little .... 1 : There were no Eye witness accounts of any resurrection recorded , everything written in the Gospels is hearsay . 2 : there is zero , nada , no evidence left behind of any resurrection ... taking a mythical story for it's literal word and convincing a few billion M o r o n s that it is real does not make it true . 3 : we know from scientific evidence and just from basic human intelligence that once a man dies and is dead for 3 days he does not get up and walk away .. sorry .. I know it hurts . 4 : add in the inconsistencies , the so called " facts " that in no way match with history , the lack of any evidence other than what you have been taught in your cult , and I would assume that the burden of proof for any resurrection would fall on YOU ... but we all know that won't happen so commence with the insults ... Does that mean I get to go to the Pit now ? .... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You might as well drop down into the Pit for all the nonsense you just spewed out . It just another crock pot full of left wing , antichrist dysentery .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If it's so much nonsense then why not give us a first hand account of your overwhelming brilliance and post your evidence to prove me wrong ? See Ezridden that is where you always seem to fail . When faced with facts and reality you always come up short . The really , REALLY ironic part of all this is the fact that if indeed " the pit " really existed and your book of fairy tales was really the key to salvation and all , well according to your own fairy tale and the way you So called " Christians " are supposed to live then You my intelligence challenged friend would be standing right next to me and ole Smiley in that " Pit " you seem to love talking about . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>There's no Sodomites in heaven . You're out of luck ( unless you repent of your stiff-necked disobedience to God ) .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yep smiley pegged you correctly . You can't post the evidence to prove me wrong so you resort to name calling and insult and completely go off topic in hopes that you won't be forced to use that pea brain of yours ... Nice try but you still have nothing ...<br><b>S1:1-  </b>There you go using the " N " word . I suppose you think you are normal too huh ? At least 2 men in a loving , comitted relationship follow the pratice of fidelity , unlike the man who has 1 wife for each day of the week .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>How do you know that the man who has 1 wife for each day of the week doesn't love his wives , or isn't committed to them . Same for the wives toward their husband ? Just curious ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I never stated that the husband or wives were not comitted to each other , I brought up the idea of fidelity . Isn't fidelity part of the american attitude of " normal " ? Or at least it is the view of the christian reich .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Time / CNN poll conducted by Harris Interactive . Nov 18 - 19 , 2003 N = 1,507 adults nationwide MoE =/ - 2.5% ( total sample ) Question " Do you think marriages between homosexual men or homosexual women should be recognized as legal by the law or not ? Yes 32% No 62% Not Sure 6% http://www.pollingreport.com/civil.htm In this poll , 59% of DEMOCRATS were opposed to homosexual marriage for emn or women . Are the Democrats now part of the Christian reich , as well ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Somehow , I think it goes a little deeper than party lines .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I believe what we are seeing is a reaction to the heterophobes that want to foist gay marriage upon the rest of America . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>What exactly is a heterophobe , and how are they " foisting " gay marriage upon America ? And tell me please , what exactly is your problem with gay marriage , why are you so opposed to it ?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>When a person is opposed to gay marriage they are often called a homophobe . When a person is opposed to the banning of gay marriage , they must therefore be a heterophobe . Because a have a personal right to be opposed to it , just as you have a right to be for it , if you indeed are . The Constitution of the U.S. gives me this right to be opposed to it , just as it gives you the right to be for it .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It would lead ultimately down the road to a marriage bill for polygamists . That is why the current push for a Constitutional Amendment to ban gay marriage also contains a provision banning polygamous marriage as well . Hmm .... some opposition to the petition ... More left wing ideology at work .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>If the man after God    s own heart had multiple wives , why can    t I ? :) I have heard others say that we already have polygamy in America . It    s called serial polygamy because of our liberal divorce laws . So now those that are opposed to even more laws on the books and a return to Old Testament practices are considered left wing ? What    s this world coming too ? LOL <br><b>S1:2-  </b>King David having multiple wives was under Old Testament practice . Jesus himself stated that divorce laws were granted by Moses and allowed by God because of the hardness of the people hearts . Jesus said a man shall leave his father and mother and be cleaved to his WIFE , Not WIVES . BTW , its called serial MONOGAMY . If its ' right wing ' to support a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage than its ' left wing ' to oppose a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So is it a sin or just a practice ? I don    t remember Jesus saying polygamy was wrong . The statement you referred to does indicate that he was talking about a single wife , but I wouldn    t base a whole social convention on one word out of a whole book . Anyway the Jews don    t believe in the New Testament . Would it be okay for them ? Man I screwed that one up . I    ll try to be a little more articulate in the future . :) Okay I was just wondering . I base my wing on what I think is correct , not left or right . A few years ago it was right wing to be against the deficit , now it seems to be left wing . But that just shows what I know about wings . LOL <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The idea that it is now left wing to be against deficits is absurd . Numerous Democrats actually wanted to spend more than the Bush Administrations 12.5% increase in federal spending .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I was basing that on your previous statement In other words , anything that is opposed to one wing must be the opposite so I don    t see how it    s absurd unless you want to call your original statement absurd . This is obviously not the thread for this discussion but I will reply this time and see where it takes us . You didn    t state what you considered to be    numerous    nor did you supply anything to back up that statement . However deficits depend on both increased spending and lower revenues . Bush has done both with large tax cuts and large discretionary spending increases . And even the conservatives are beginning to criticize him for being a big spending president . Over the past 23 years ,    conservative    administrations have increased the deficits and    liberal    administrations have decreased the deficits . So yeah it looks to me like left wing is against deficits and right wing is for deficits .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Well ... so far eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue have found that barring same-sex marriage is unconstitutional . We're waiting to hear about three or four more . As for the nature of marriage , it is both a legal contract and ( sometimes ) a religious ceremony ( sacrament in some religions ) . We're stuck with the duality , whether we like it or not , and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect . Different religions can do what they want .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>They found that it violated their state constitutions , right ? This has nothing to do with the US Constitution . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The winning arguments were based largely on state constitutional provisions that closely parallel , if not outright mimmick , the federal constitution .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That's not generally true , is it ? For example , the Massachusetts ruling was based on a specific provision in the Mass . constitution that prohibits discrimination based on sexual preference . There's nothing like that in the US constitution . And my overall point was that we should be careful when calling something " unconstitutional " , in that we should be clear it we're talking state or federal constitution . Many state constitutions guarantee rights that aren't in the fedral constitution . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>There's nothing like that in the Mass . Constitution either . Though , it's a darned good idea ! Goodrich was decided on equal protection grounds , citing the Mass . document . I'd have to look up the others to see the exact reasoning , but they're not likely to be far afield from the bedrock principles of equal protection and due process . Gay rights is a real test of our constitutional system , and , so far , we're not passing with flying colors ...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're right , I misremembered . It's just descrimination based on sex that's banned .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>This is off-topic , but I do not see any forum on Supreme Court issues or constitutional interpretation generally . The New York Times has a little quiz to see how our views line up with those of the current Supreme Court and with the American public on various constitutional questions . Here is a link to the quiz : NY Times Advertisement Although I am liberal in my political views , my answers to the quiz questions indicate that I am in the center when it comes to constitutional questions .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What an awful quiz . It reinforces my point that people are making the court a second legislative body . If we want them to make decisions like this we are better off just having congress do it . At least they are voted in . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The problem with the quiz is that it just asks people's opinion about the issue ; it does not address the constitutional questions involved . The Supreme Court should not rule based on their opinions of the issue ; they should rule based on their interpretation of the constitution . The Supreme Court has ruled on the issues in the quiz , but their rulings should not have been based on what individual justices happen to think of guns or abortion .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>And the rulings shouldn't be considered " conservative " or " liberal " . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Right . Court rulings are interpretations of the constitution , and they are not , or should not be , expressions of the justices ' personal political beliefs . Even the NYTimes story saying that the Roberts court leans " conservative " does not really make sense , as " conservative " suggests a political viewpoint , not a philosophy of judicial interpretation .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Right , for example the ruling allowing corporations to run campaign ads or whatever was not really conservative ... pro corporation maybe but that doesn't necessary mean conservative ( perhaps more " republican " ) . Scalia actually goes around and does a speech where he gives examples of rulings he has made that upset both sides basically saying he doesn't care who he offends . Reading some of his opinions makes me believe he really doesn't care about offending people haha .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>First of all , to convince me of that you will to find real scientific evidence . Anything coming from Cameron is suspect for reasons already pointed out ; he has kicked been out of the legitimate scientific community , gotten in trouble judges and had NUMEROUS scientists publicly condemn him for misuse of their research . Secondly even if this were true , and their lifespans were shorter , that does not legitimize anti-gay legislation or discrimination . What I am saying is that such measures from people like you hurt them . Their being gay does not hurt you . You are in the wrong as you are on the end that is inflicting damage .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Here's a hypothetical situation for you , Jito . You    re the minister of public health for a country in BFE . You're given indisputable proof that a small portion of the population has contracted a disease linked directly to their lifestyle that reduces their lifespan by 20 years . What do you do : a . Ignore it b . Take steps to prevent further spread c . Reward the infected and promote their lifestyle d . None of the above <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Homosexuality is not a disease so the analogy you are building is false . If you are going to segue into HIV , that virus will infect ANYONE and just being gay does not put you at greater risk . Promsicuity and IV drug usage do - but neither of those behaviors are the exclusive realm of homosexuals .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Don't cop out , Jito . Anser the question AS WRITTEN . No assumptions . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I will not . You are building an analagy that is based in the idea that homosexuality is a disease or in some other way harmful . Its not , I will not give credit to the analagy .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I've already proven time and time again that granting gays the rights and plivleges of marriage DOES affect the rest of us financially . Your failure to admit that fact shows the disengenuity of your position . You're chickening out because you know what the only logical answer can be . I thought that you had more integrity than copping out like that , Jito .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>OOH bitchy ay ? Its worse than I thought you actually dont know your a*se from your Any sexual activity between two men is deviant sex Two men getting hard and lucky on each other is not approved by most people , believe me . This is the bit that amuses me ! When the gay starts losing an argument they start implying that the objector is a closet homosexual .. 50 years ago it would be ridiculous to contemplate two Homosexuals ' marrying ' . nowdays it may well become reality . The pedophiles are rubbing their hands no doubt<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Bologna . This straight gal is here to tell you most people really don't care about the sex lives of other adults and current stats show that with the exception of gay marriage that most people support equal rights for gays and believe homosexuality is perfectly acceptable . My son's ( adoptive ) father is gay , is a marvelous father and one the greatest blessings in our life . My old man is one these big macho , traditional , conservative types and my son's father a hundred times the man and father my father is . Frankly , he is one of the best fathers I have ever known . Denying needing children a loving parent ( s ) to satiate you bigotry , now THAT is a crime . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No they dont , most people do not trust gays Good for you . Now lets let gay men adopt children and teach them the joys of man love . Gayhumanist knows all about sodomy , let him start .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Quite being so infantile . You are like a two year old . You are not representative of anything . The whole world does not think like you . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Open your eyes woman .. they are using you !<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Talk about pervy - am I to assume you have been peeping on my life ? And just who the hell are " they " ? I don't know every gay person on the planet . I have a lesbian friend - we have giggled and enjoyed eachother's company since I was 17 . I also have a doting lesbian aunt . My son's father has been a loving parent and good friend . If this is being used they can have at it . I already acknowledged that there not have majority support for gay marriage ( not that being in a majority automatically makes you right ) . I was responding to gansao's comment that most people don't trust gays . Do pay attention to what you are reading . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So because you have a lesbian friend and know a nice gay man we should all agree that gays should be allowed to ' marry ' and we also should all approve of perverted sex ? I had a bisexual girlfriend who became a prostitute .. she was nice too .... so what ? You are right .. most people do not trust gays .. and this has usually nothing to do with religion either .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>That is the whole point isn't it . Marriage is a contract between the state and the two people involved . The whole ironic thing is to the anti gay christianists that are so opposed to gay marries the religious marriage is what counts and is the important aspect but they can not stop gay people from getting religious marriage only the contract from the state , which to the anti gay christianists means nothing . How are they harmed if two men they do not know sign a contract with the state . Are they going to be offended If I form a corporation ? It is none of their business , just as their marriages are none of my business . Yes they are forced to have to accept same sex marriages big f'n deal I am forced to accept their hetero marriages . They didn't ask my permission if they could get married so why should I have to ask their permission ?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I suppose . I'm not religious , so what Christians do is pretty meaningless to me . I would not claim anyone is harmed . But we all have to live in this society , so the official policies are our business . Your threat here is empty since heterosexual marriage is the status quo . You have to justify changes you wish to make to the status quo , but what currently is in place doesn't need justification . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It was a christian organization , or group , or christianally deluded legislators in every case that gathered signatures for and put these marriage amendments on the ballot in every state . If I own a business I am legally forced , as a gay man , to recognise that hetero marriage . Your right we all have to live in this society and they demand that I respect , and acknowledge , their marriages . One could use your argument about slavery , misogyny , or any other unjust system . It is the status quo so there is nothing wrong with it .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Good for them . It's an issue that should be voted on " right " and " wrong " are value judgements . It is the challenger's responsibility not to show the status quo as unjust , but that their proposal is somehow better than the status quo . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So then all civil rights from freedom of speech to religious freedom should be voted upon ? Because I would love to vote to take religious freedom away from the christianists . nonsense it is called protecting heterosexual privilege and nothing more .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>What civil rights ? Are unmarried individuals denied rights ? What privilege is that ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>That is not the question I asked Do you believe taht basic rights such as freedom of speech and religion should go on to the ballot ? For instance do you think that the religious freedom of say that mormon , for instance , should go on the ballot for people to vote away ? The privlege they are trying to defend by keeping gay people from marriage .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Since they are Constitutional rights , it would be slightly impossible to do :P What privelige is that ? We don't have a right to love ( at least , not one the gov't can help with ) . We don't have a right to marry whomever we love , or to love whomever we marry . What do you lack that every single unmarried person in America does not also lack , gay or straight ?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I'm saying that the limit to opposite sexes is one limit among others . If you don't follow the rules you don't qualify for the benefits . The fact that thereare rules does not mean anyone is barred from the custom .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And those rules used to include race as a qualifier for marriage . Neither blacks nor whites were allowed to marry outside of their race . Rights were applied equally based upon the confines of this criteria . If whom you wanted to marry fell outside of this criteria you were not allowed to wed . This is the same principal you are using to show equal rights amongst hetero and homo sexual people . The only difference is that as it stands now race has been removed from the criteria as it was viewed to be inappropriate and discriminatory . The gay marriage proponents are now advocating that gender be removed from the same criteria as it is also inappropriate and discriminatory . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Except they were demonstratably unequal . A black person could not marry those that a white person could marry , and white people were barred from marriage to those that black people were not barred from . Currently , there is no barrier that homosexual people have that heterosexual people do not share . The two situations are dissimilar . As long as there are any rules , this will be true . No-one may marry someone already married , an animal , a minor , or a sibling . There is nothing wrong with trying to change the status quo , but you don't have a right to the changes you want . They are just changes you want .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Yes , the qualifying criteria for marriage at the time was unequal which is why race was removed from criteria . But anyone who wanted to get married had to meet this criteria which was applied to everyone . This is the same argument that you are using to prove that there is no inequality between hetrosexuals and homosexuals . Yes , there is . A heterosexual couple can get married . A homosexual couple cannot . Your objection is a semantic one . Admittedly , no one has the right to marriage . But again I will reiterate . That is not the issue . The issue is homosexual couples cannot get married while heterosexual couples can . In so doing the government recognizes the heterosexual couple as significant members of the same family and award that couple benefits which include the ability to visit one another in a hospital , the ability to make impotortant life decisions if one of the members should become incompasitated , the ability to cover one another under their insurance , the ability to file taxes jointly , the ability to purchase property together and survivorship rights of said property , inheritance rights , and many others . These priveleges are being denied to homosexual couples . Not people , couples . They are being denied the above privelges not because the don't deserve them but because some people don't like the idea of them having sex . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not the criteria . The effect . Except that neither the qualifying criteria nor the effect is unequal between heterosexual and homosexual individuals . True , but couples do not have rights , individuals do . Agreed . I think it's more complicated than that , but that is essentially so . Heterosexual relationships are perceived as somehow more valid or as having a purpose that homosexual relationships lack . This is true ( if " purpose " is the right word ) on an evolutionary level , so the view has some validity . Of course , that should have no automatic policy implications but it would explain some of the resistance to the idea .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Agreed . Rights may not be the correct word . But there are benefits that heterosexual couples can obtain and homosexual couples cannot . Agreed . The bolded part of your post is the basis of gay marriage proponents . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The problem is that acquiring these marriage benefits depends on how people view that type of relationship . The biological or evolutionary " purpose " might not have automatic policy implications but they are made real by the people who vote on the issue . I'm not sure how to overcome this obstacle .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Please gansao , don't give them any ideas . And for Gods sake , hide your Gerbils , will you ?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>ha ha ha Archie very funny ... I'm sure the saints at the pearly gates are ROLLING at that little tidbit .. I'm sure you could also tell that one to chuck smith and he'd snicker or at the sunday brunch at whatever church it is you go to ... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The sad thing once again jason , is that you and Jake just fail to comprehend the seriousness of the spiritual situation you are in . And you prove that sentiment by thinking that anything about your lifestyle is funny in any way to anyone . So NO jason , from the saints at the pearly gates to Chuck Smith , to me , nobody is laughing at the reality of the perverted and sick sexual proclivities which define the unnatural practices which have been conceived of and engaged in by your ilk .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Can't you tell sarcasm when you see it or are you really that blind ? Funny thing is but I wasn't the one making jokes about gerbils being inserted into someones rectum YOU WERE . So do not sit here and once again spew the same ranting and raving about " lifestyle " and " ilk " like the thousands of other times before ... And here we go again the proverbial merry go round . Sex sex sex sex sex .... Gee Archie is that all you think about when it comes to people ? I mean honestly can ; t you think of a better argument to come up with ? No one cares what other people do in the bedroom simply because it is private ! You don't define your next door neighbor based upon what he does in the bedroom , or your mailman or the guy who works in the toll booth . Simply put Americans could care less what other people do behind closed doors . And what you do behind closed doors does not define you as a person ! If it did people would probably be calling you " stale " ..... Now there's a joke Archie laugh it up ... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Who's joking ; not me , at all . I don't see anything funny about that sick practice which was discovered from within your community .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Oh please ... " discovered " and I side with JP on this one . Heteros have been known to do some pretty messed up things as well ...<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Its nothing like racial segregation ....<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It's everything like racial segregation and every kind of segregation throughout the course of history . Every time prejudice / racism / sexism / anti-semetism / homophobia / etc. is challenged the perpetrators always claim " this is nothing like the last " . But it always is . This is no exception . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>What are you talking about ? Tell me what I contend is not segregation ? I dont think you know , I think you are just running at the mouth / keypad without knowing what you are actually commenting on !<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You think wrong . What makes you think this kind of discrimination is any different ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So what did I contend was not segregation ?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You said " Its nothing like racial segregation .... " , which implies that if society did the same thing to gays that they did to blacks it would be different , or less wrong . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Wrong ! Try again . What did I actually contend was nothing like segregation not what you thought I did . You jumped in with your silly little rant without actually knowing the point I made .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Then you should've said " It's nothing like segregation " . Don't blame me for your mistakes . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>You still dont know what you are talking about do you ? My response to Addison was correct . This is why you cannot be taken seriously . You are wrong<br><b> S2:5-  </b>* Facepalm* I didn't say your response wasn't correct , I said it was phrased wrong . What makes you think throwing a temper tantrum will validate your argument ? Funny how you call me an immature child yet you are the one slinging insults and personal attacks when you don't get your way . <br><b>S1:6-  </b>So I will ask you once again .... So what did I contend was not segregation ? I you dont know that then you dont know whether my responce was correct or not You dont know do you ? Thats why I am not insulting you , I am just stating a fact :)<br><b> S2:6-  </b>You said " It's nothing like racial segregation " , implying that the plight of gays is nothing like the plight of blacks . What you meant and what I interpreted are two different things . And what does this even mean ? <br><b>S1:7-  </b>You are wrong . I did not imply that the plight of gays is nothing like the plight of blacks in that post . You have read this in other posts and assumed that is what I said .<br><b> S2:7-  </b>Then that's my mistake . I admitted I took it the wrong way long ago . <br><b>S1:8-  </b>You did not .. you just said that I had ' implied ' what you believed I said .<br><b> S2:8-  </b>That's because you did , and because of that I took it the wrong way . You're making my job of discrediting you painfully easy . <br><b>S1:9-  </b>You only have succeeded in discrediting yourself .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What you don't remember is that I favor civil unions , just not marriage . And that's because I'm just religious enough to view marriage as a sacrament and the Bible's pretty clear on homosexuality .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Then favor them for everyone . Go down to your county clerks office and tell them you want to convert your marriage license to a civil union . Flygirl challenged you to do so but I suppose that even if that were possible you wouldn't do it you like you heterosexual privilege too much . The bible has nothing and should have nothing to do with the law . The bible is nothing more then a book of fairy tales told to scare little children . There in not one thing eventrue in the book . Grimm's fairy tales has more truth in it then the bible . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You make no sense ... as usual . Why would someone that considers marriage a sarcament go down to city hall to have it turned into a civil union ? Sorry , but I'm allowed to vote as I want based on whatever criteria I feel inclined to use . The fact that the majority of Americans feel the same way is refreshing , IMO .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>And you hit the nail on the head with this one . The US government does not consider marriage to be a sarcament . You are mixing religion and government . A marriage liscense is a secular document that is a contract between the state and the the couple , it has nothing to do with religion . You have said you favor civil unions for gay people and I am saying that if you think that civil unions are equal to marriage just a different name then you go turn in your liscense in favor of a civil union . However you know that they aren't so you will never do it , even if it were possible . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>As a voter , I can mix whatever I want . That's the part that you aren't getting . Uncle Sam can't establish a religion or give special consideration to one religion ; voters can do whatever they please and I choose to not want same sex marriage included under the definition of marriage . As for civil unions , I think your time would be better spent trying to fill the gaps in it instead of trying to scrap the current definition of marriage .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Fine then I think the people of California should decide weather the people of Michigan can get to have drivers licenses . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Since when does one state get to make thast determination for another state ? You're building moldy strawmen now , Matt .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Since when does group of citizens get to vote on the civil rights of another group when the vote will not effect them ? Letting the majority vote on whether a minority gets to marry is like letting the people of California decide if the people of Michigan get driver licenses . The people of California still get to drive and it hasn't effected their lives but with their vote they have adversely effected the lives of others . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I've already proven time and time again that granting gays the rights and plivleges of marriage DOES affect the rest of us financially . Your failure to admit that fact shows the disengenuity of your position . You're chickening out because you know what the only logical answer can be . I thought that you had more integrity than copping out like that , Jito .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>And rimming some dude's hairy bung is soooo appealing by comparison ?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What DVDs have you been watching , JP ? You also know where all the gloryholes are -- http://www.4forums.com/political/196594-post146.html Oh wait . I'm sure those gay people you know open right up and discuss all these details with you . Naturally they would , given your accepting , extremely liberal attitudes . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I do a lot of traveling and I am observant . How about you ? And since you like to search out 3 year old posts , do you want to take me up on my old challenge related to the spread of HIV in the US ?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Naturally . It doesn't take a genius to figure out how one would be privy to such information . One would have to be an insider with the group which uses gloryholes . No , I don't know where the gloryholes are . If I ever want to know I guess I'll just ask you or one of your close friends . Maybe Pastor Ted Haggard ?? Changing the subject . Saw that one coming a mile away . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No , just ask one of your gay buddies .... Or open up your eyes the next time you're at a rest area on a major highway . I see that you don't have the nads to take me up on my challenge , huh ?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No , I think I'd have much better luck asking one of yours . Ha , nice try . I sincerely doubt that . You're caught , and now just making it up as you go along . You originally said , ask any gay man and he will seem to know . I've never come across that at a rest area . Perhaps I just don't know where to look and when all of this goes on . Maybe I should again , consult you or your close friends if I want to know . We've discussed that nonsense to death many times . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>It    s legal , but it does show the lack of moral character of those voting for the bum . Here in Michigan , they closed down the first rest area on I-75 because of the high amount of gay encounters taking place there . Maybe you should poke your head out of your closet once in a while and see what the rest of your community is up to . Yes , and I    ve yet to find a gay supporter that can refute my assertion . Maybe you    d like to be the first ? You could be our resident    gay avenger    . We could get you spandex pants and a silk cape , pink of course , if you win . It doesn    t take an insider to know that Mass is full of unprincipled puppets that vote Democrat despite the turd running .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>There's a lack of moral character in those who vote away the rights of others , like in Prop . H 8 . Yes , Americans are paranoid about homosexuality , you don't have to convince me of that . Some straight men would brag about scoring with a sexy woman in a public place but not getting caught . You're trying to change the subject , Larry Craig , er ... JP Sartre . Anyway , I'm not the one in the closet that's for sure . Here's what you originally said : http://www.4forums.com/political/gay...rdered-10.html So I'm expected to actually believe that you , JP , Mr. Anti-Gay Conservative are having this type of intimate relationship with gay men , who feel comfortable opening up like this with someone like you . JP is of course , merely curious in seeking that information as to where the glory holes can be found . Just as Pastor Ted Haggard claimed he never intended to use the meth he sought out . There's only one reason JP would be in this fruit loop . He knows gay people alright , extremely well . Oh defensively mock away at gay men . You just prove my point above . Maybe the lesser of two evils ? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I don't see any lack of moral character in people exercising their Constitutional Rights to deny the sanctity of marriage to immoral associations by not allowing the definition of marriage to be bastardized . I've been married , faithfully , for over 31 years . What's the longest exclusive relationship you're had , a month . I guess you missed the term " a high % of heterosexual males " in my statement . And you assumed that my knowledge of glory holes came from chatting with gays as opposed to firsthand observations and other means . No , I didn't mock " gay men " , I mocked you . :p [ / quote ] Maybe the lesser of two evils ? [ / QUOTE ] What could be more evil than a murdering drunk ?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I don't either . But that's not what happened . It was denied to loving , comitted gay couples . Yes , it was with one of your special closeted " friends " who was away from his wife of many years . He was always really horny and frustrated , looking for sheer Below again , is how you said you came by such knowledge in response to Matthew's query , you said you knew gay people . And before that you said ask any gay male and he'll tell you all about it . I'm right to assume you asked or talked to gay males about it in painstaking detail . This is obviously the crowd you hang out with . These are gay men who are very liberal in their sexual practices , maybe closeted , just looking to get their rocks off , and you're obviously right in the loop . I don't know why such an anti-gay , morally upstanding , righteous anti-gay Republican conservative such as yourself would have any interest in associating with such a scene . What would your wife think ? This is just a guess , she doesn't know ? You assumed I'd want to wear pink tights because I'm gay . That's not even clever or funny .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Oh please there is no me it does not say man and woman because it presumes that it IS a man and a woman . It doesnt say man and goldfish but I would never be able to marry my pet carp . There are plenty of couples with an equal chance of producing a handicapped child as an incestuous couple .. they are still allowed to stay married . Marriage in ancient Rome really has no bearing on modern day marriage . Addison , I am not against gay marriages ... not because of gay rights or because Rome or ancient Greece allowed it . We in Britain have had gay marriages for a while and it has made no difference to anyone in Britain except gay people ... the sky hasnt fallen on top of us ... so why should I object ?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>How is there plenty of couples who have an equal chance of producing a handicapped child as an incestuous couple ? I personally dont care too much if family members want to get married . I think it has a bearing on marriage today . Only in the sense that it shows that gay marriage has existed in history and hasnt always been between a man and a women as is falsely claimed . If you are not against gay marriages then what is this argument about exactly ? Do you have an objection to gay marriage ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>There are couples where one or more carry genes that make a handicapped child likely . My argument is that gay people should be allowed to marry but not because they have an automatic right but that it does no harm to society .. there is a difference<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Fair enough . But that could go for heterosexual couples as well . Edit : Which you have said in a post after the one I responded too . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>To be honest I am amazed that there is not a more positive approach to gay marriage by gay people themselves . Why arent they not stating that gay marriage is a positive thing for todays secular society and is no threat to Christianity ? See Peter Tatchell<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I have said before on other forums that gay marriage is not a threat to Christianity before but that really isnt the reason they dont want gay marriage to be legal . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Some Christians believe that gay sex is a sin . So do I. I also believe that theft , adultery , violence etc etc is a sin too . but thieves , adulterers and violent people are still allowed to marry . Why shouldnt everyone be allowed to find their own path to hell ? IMO gay people should be wheeling out accountants , doctors , engineers , truck drivers and toilet cleaners saying ... look we are just like you . This can be done in the media , sport , etc It worked in Britain ... IMO<br><b> S2:4-  </b>How exactly did gay marriage get legalized in Britain ?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You would if it involved a gay sex proposal . Then you'd hop on it in a New York minute .

Sodomites .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>To listen to you tell it . But who is listening to you ? No one . Especially not me . I have a husband . Got the document to prove it . Witnessed by hundreds , in a mass ceremony at a local MCCR church , in 2003 . What sins do you need to repent ? Your judgment of me , in and of itself is a sin . Reprobate . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You're too stupid to be saved . Hell awaits you and your illicit " husband . "<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Sorry . If I don't believe it , it's not true .

That is not homophobic , that is a fact and you should condemn it too ...........<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So , you have been there to see this I take it or are you going on rumors and misinformation . Did you read about this on the focus on family website ?

When the AIDS first came out they were shut down but they are flourishing again now and the occupants have gone back to unprotected sex ......... From what I have surmised you are gay . I am surprised you did not know that .....<br><b> S2:3-  </b>YOu made a very specific claim about 100 men in a daisy chain having unprotected sex . It is clear to me that post was not based in fact , but opinion . If you don't have the proof of the claim , you shouldn't make it ! That is what makes you a homophobe . You make claims about gays without knowing the truth . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Why do you think they closed the bath houses down in the eighties ?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>This , at last check is 2005 , what they did in the 80's has nothing to do with the topic at hand , or your comments . So either justify your comments or take them back and admit they were uncalled for ... <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Joe you need to read the link I cited in a post in this thread ......... Gays in SF are trying to get the bath houses reopened .........<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Great ! What does that have to do with gay rights ? What does it have to do with the title of this thread ? How can you take what a small group of gays in California are doing and equate it to the behaviors of all gays . That is irresponsible .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Gay activists love to compare public disapproval of homosexuality with racial discrimination . This is wrong . One is a hatred or fear of another human being . The other is dissapproval of another human beings behavior<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Are you saying that racial discrimination is " dissapproval of another human beings behavior " [ sic ] ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You had two choices .. you got it wrong .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>How is " being " gay a behavior ? I am just sitting here in my pajamas being gay . What behavior am I exhibiting that warrants your disapproval ? PS . Bonus question : What is a gay activist ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If you were fired I would imagine it would be because of incompetence rather than being gay :)<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You didn't any of the questions , you coward . 1 . If I am fired for being gay ( perfectly legal is most places in the US ) , is that " dissapproval of another human beings behavior " [ sic ] ? This happens all the time , not for imcompentence . It is legal to fire someone solely for being gay . What behavior is being disapproved of ? 2 . How is " being " gay a behavior ? I am just sitting here in my pajamas being gay . What behavior am I exhibiting that warrants your disapproval ? PS . Bonus question : What is a gay activist ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>If you asked relevant questions I would answer them . Oh google .. gay activist and you will find out what it<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Although Jim and MrWrite's debate has devolved into an unfortunate battle of screw you's , the comparison of the arguments against interacial marriage and those against gay marriage has some merit . At least that's what this article suggests : Opponents of gay marriage use many of the same arguments as foes of interracial relationships did before Loving v . Virginia outlawed state bans on interracial marriage in 1967 , said law professor Kim Forde-Mazrui at a talk sponsored by the Center for the Study of Race and Law and Lambda Law Alliance Sept . 30 . http://www.law.virginia.edu/home2002...fall/forde.htm<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This is not relevant to my argument at all . I have mentioned nothing about religious beliefs or bible-thumping protests against homosexuality . I did not bring interacial marriage into the discussion because it does not apply . I'm not against interacial marriage as long as there's a man and a woman involved . I did not bring the silly argument about water fountains into the discussion . Separate-but-equal does apply in the sense that records of legally recognized couples would separate married couples from same-sex couples but would not justify any inequalities regarding their rights and privileges . Hospital visitation , inheritance and other things could be afforded both . I'm wondering if those who insist on same-sex couples being called " married " are not acting somewhat from self-imposed shame ... like you want to hide the fact that you are gay . My argument has thusfar been limited to the requirement to redefine several other words if we redefine " marriage " . It has nothing to do with homophobia which , by the way , I do not suffer from . I have some friends that are gay and they know how I feel about the word " marriage " . We remain friends . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I accept your argument at face value , although I will say that I believe that the majority of people who argue against gay marriage do so for religious or homophobe reasons . ( Again , I'm not saying you fall into these categories . ) Words get redefined all the time , and some of them are just as important as the word ' marriage ' . For example , the Iraq War is not technically a war -- congress never declared war . And this isn't just a semantic detail , either . Declaring war used to mean that congress committed , the president committed , and all the citizens made sacrifices for the cause . Now we initiate military operations , never declare war in order to allow political wiggle room , cut everyone's taxes , tell them to go shopping , and call it a war anyway . Now that's redefining a word . Substituting a Jack for a Jill on a marriage license seems pretty minor in comparison to me .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The invasion of Iraq was a resumption of warfare that ended in a cease fire . It was not technically a new war requiring all the congressional steps . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not to derail this thread -- we can talk about this more in the Politics section -- but the last time the US Congress declared war was for WWII . So the conflict in Iraq is not in fact a resumption of a prior declared war .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're technically correct . However , the Gulf War was approved by Congress whether it was a declared war or not . The Iraq War was a continuation of the same conflict after a cease fire . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I understand the Bush administration has made this argument , but I don't think it has a whole lot of merit . It was a different presidential administration and the reasons for the conflict were different -- to repel the invasion of Kuwait . Not to mention that the same logical argument could be used to begin a fresh invasion of Vietnam or Korea .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I think not . Those conflicts ended in something other than a cease fire .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Most Christians don't try to do that to gay people either .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Sure they do . A majority of self-identified Christians in THIS country oppose civil marriage for gay people . In Spain , for example , they don't . A huge majority of self-identified " evangelical Christians " oppose gay marriage , civil unions , gay adoption , anti-discrimination laws , the Lawrence decision to decriminalize same-sex sex , etc. , etc. , etc. As I recall , that predeliction knows no national borders . Oh , I know , they're not trying to ban really important things .... y a w n <br><b>S1:2-  </b>But they're not trying to ban it . That was the accusation made .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Have you not heard of the state constitutional amendments being passed to preclude same-sex marriage AND civil unions ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Evangelical Christendom is trying to BAN gay people ? Wow , I wish all evangelicals really WERE that united for something . Sure ; but that's not what we're talking about , now is it ? You were asking about the gay pride industry . LOL ! No , you all blew your credibility on that claim long ago . Gay lobbyists have LONG stepped over that line in the sand ( of simply " counter-attacking " ) .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're losing your touch . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>what do you mean by THAT ?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Agreed , when the husband is part of a hetero relationship . Gay husband is not a legally recognized category . Agreed , when the wife is part of a hetero relationship . Gay wife is not a legally recognized category . Agreed , when the spouse is part of a hetero relationship . Gay spouse is not a legally recognized category .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem . What is the reason it's not legally recognized ? Because the couple is gay . Where do you get the figure of 500,000 gay couples who want to immediately be married ? Would these gay couples beat the straight couples in some kind of a race to the weddings occurring at the same time , or occurring over the course of a month or a year ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>They're not legally recognized because they don't meet the legal criteria for marriage , ie one man , one woman . A cat doesn't meet the legal definition of a dog . Do we change the definition of dog to appease the cat ? That's the real question to be answered by society . Actually , I pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only , but after reading the CBO report , I see that I wasn't far off . They predicted 600,000 gay couples would want to get married it allowed .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This is circular reasoning however . It's stating that marriage simply is heterosexual , and so completely ends debate . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Exactly my point , just as a cat can never be considered a dog just because someone wants it to be . To me , and I'm guessing millions of others , the term gay marriage is an oxymoron . That's not to say that we shouldn't consider the possibility of allowing gay unions with , possibly , equivalent rights to hetero couples if we , as a society , see the benefit in doing so . For example , prior to FDR , the concept of state welfare was considered ludicrous and unconstitutional , but he was able to get enough support ( and enough political muscle ) to change society's mind on the role of the Federal gov't once he demonstrated the " good " that doing so had on America in its most dire time of need . People were willing to sacrifice a little freedom for security just as Ben Franklin had warned against . Now , I'll be the first to tell you that I think FDR was the biggest threat to American freedom that ever existed , but one can't argue his ability to change public opinion on the role of the Federal gov't .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It concerns reason , as Jaxian said earlier . What are the logical reasons for marriage discrimination against gays and lesbians ?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>My apologizies . I read it hastily and got it completely bassackwards . The CBO estimate in your link did , indeed , say that the result would be up to ~ $1 Billion surplus .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So you also recognize that your argument that same-sex marriage does not benefit society is also " bassackwards " ? Finally ! Some progress . Remember ... this thread is supposed to be about fiscal concerns . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I have conceded that it doesn't have the negative financial impact that I thought it would . That WAS the purpose for my attempting to have a civil debate on what I thought the issues were . I'd like to move past the fiscal concerns and onto the moral and health concerns if we can continue to do you with civility .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Gosh , I love a good typo ! In any case , I suppose a tepid concession is all we can expect . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Good catch . And you were hoping for ............ ?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>A forthright concession . Any maybe some discussion of how same-sex marriage benefits society in practical ways . Instead , we're off to your safe ground of " morality " . Safe , not because you're right , but because morality IS relative and IS subjective . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I was hoping that you'd be telling me the benefits , not vice versa . But you forget , I'm not one of " those " who feels the need to impose my morality on everyone else . I'm more than willing to let society as a whole determine its own limits . While I'm a staunch defender of the Constitution ( as written , not as interpreted ) , I'm way more flexible with public determined acceptable standards of behavior . I'll even cut my grass so that it is the same level as my neighbors . :)<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Don't you think that in 1909 it was probably viewed mostly from a moral standpoint ? I don't think they saw it the same way they would see black people . They didn't even realize that ' homosexuality ' was any sort of innate thing . It was entirely behavioral to them . I tend to agree with the court , even given what you've said . I doubt for 1909 it was about prejudice and bigotry -- they genuinely felt it was wrong . The concept of gay marriage was completely foreign and unknown in 1909 . It wasn't even something they conceived of . I think the court is saying that they couldn't have been prejudiced against something they didn't even know of or conceive of .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Hogwash . It was once entirely moral to believe certain races were inferior , and that women had fewer rights than men . Treating the races and women as equal was not something even thought of by many . It was prejudice against gays then , and it still is today . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>This is not really true . It's a popular misconstruing of morality and history by proponents of modern ' rights ' movements , but it's not true . There's little historical backing to the idea that people believed oppressing black people was a right thing to do , as in , doing good . There were times they used an argument where religion was wrongly used to justify their behavior , but that's a different matter . If you firmly believe otherwise , I'd challenge you to show where people thought oppressing blacks was an example if doing good . The same goes for misogyny . Furthermore , it's beside the point anyway . We're talking about homosexuality . In 1909 , the only thing they really understood about the issue at hand was that some people engaged in sexual relations with people of their own gender . There were no articles about " homosexuality " as a trait , and certainly none about genetic causes . It was understood entirely from a behavioral standpoint , and therefore a moral standpoint . So it's not hogwash at all -- they really did view gay sex as immoral . If you don't think so , then you have a very poor grasp on history in this case .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This kind of morality is based on nothing but ignorance ( which you admit ) and prejudice . What kind of a basis is that for a so-called moral code ? So what if it involves behaviour ? Gay people have sex , develop relationships , and bond , just like everyone else , but in a way that reflects their gay sexuality . This does not mean people could not be prejudiced about the way gay people live . People were , and are so prejudiced . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>A better reverse analogy would have been to say " So then conversly I have the right to advocate that heterosexual relations are morally wrong " . Not heterosexuality , since it's not homosexuality ( as it's a state of being ) that religious people have a problem with . Heck , they often don't even recognize it . With that caveat , yes you are certainly free to advocate whatever you want to be morally wrong . ( And unlike the way some in your movement do , I won't call you a " bigot " for doing so ! ) It may have been based on " ignorance " , but I reject the notion it was based on prejudice ( and therefore I tend to agree with the 6 - 0 view of the justices here ) . The 1909 society had too little understanding of gay people to be prejudiced over in the first place . Remember , homosexuality was not understood as a state of being at that time . The term itself had not been around long and was not known to most people . And even to those it was known to , it was not known as a state of being . And there certainly was no social identity among gay people as a group -- how could prejudice have existed if there was nothing ( from their perspective ) to be prejudiced toward ?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Right . Provided gays don't live gay , but live straight , gays can be as gay as they want . As long as gays don't outwardly show what makes them different from straights , gays can be as gay as they want . It's bs . Also some may not recognize the existence of gay people or their gay lives , but that is putting one's head in the sand . Nonsense . People would widely and hatefully use the term " sodomite " to refer to gays . Before that the term was " molly " . Clearly there was an identity they were prejudiced towards . They were rounding up gays in areas they were known to attend , and putting them in prison . Read up on the trial of Oscar Wilde . Gays may have been forced underground , to a greater extent , but that does not mean they were not thought of . Gays were just not thought of in a nice way . Gays were purposely kept out of everything in society , when society didn't really think of gays as human too . That isn't prejudice ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Because they didn't approve of sodomy ! Do you not agree they didn't understand the concept of homosexuality ??? There was no social identity . When they were put on trial , it wasn't because they were gay ( which they had no concept of ) , it was because they had gay relations which society viewed as wrong ! No , here's where you don't get it -- it's not that " gays " ( there was no concept of that ) were purposely kept out of of everything , it's that people who had sodomy relationships were kept out of everything , because sodomy was viewed as wrong . They really did think it was wrong ! You are so determined to portray everything that has anything to do with gay relations possibly being wrong as prejudice and bigotry that you are close-minded about it .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The divorce rate in the U.S. is really blown out of proportion by high rate of very young people whjo get divorced ............. The percentage of people getting divorces who have been married over 5 years drops dramatically ...........<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Um , young people and young marriages really aren't the same thing . There are those young people who actually do stay together past those first five years . The truth of the matter is that couples in general who divorce do so more often within the first five years , regardless of age . The point was and still is , that heterosexual marriages end in divorce nearly 50% of the time . End of story . You can try to pretty it up all you want , it doesn't change the fact that you heteros are no better at staying together than you expect us gays / lesbians to . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Of course there are but a lot of young people get married and realize it was a mistake and get divorced ............<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Yeah , so ? There are a lot of older people who get married and realize the same thing and get divorced ... all within the same five year time period . One does not really have a lot to do with the other . Nor does it change the fact that more than half of ALL marriages end in divorce . Period , end of story , no nit-picking ... { Just remember these marriages still only are consisted of HETEROSEXUALS ... } <br><b>S1:3-  </b>yes but because of the high rate of young people that get divorced it throws the percentage off ...... Statistics prove by a wide majority that gays in general are much more promiscuous then straights .........<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are completely off base : READ THIS ; http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_dira.htm http://www.divorcemag.com/statistics/statsUS.shtml http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?P...naUpdateID=170 Try reading actual census data : http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1027306/posts You cannot compare gay to straight promiscuity within the context of a " marriage " when only straights are legally allowed to get married . It's obvious the data will be skewed , any idiot could see that . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>you can't compare marriage but you can compare relationships ........<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Read the articles before you shoot off your mouth . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I very rarely read propaganda be it from the right or the left ...........<br><b> S2:5-  </b>So now data from the Census Bureau is now " Propaganda ? " What a riot ! <br><b>S1:6-  </b>No one can actually know what percentage of the population of the U.S. is gay ........ If you throw out the lesbians it would be about 2 percent .......<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What about the Domionists ? Do they care about other people or do they just care about POWER ?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I just did a google search and couldn't find a Dominionist Web Site at all . The only articles I could find on this devious organization are from radical Left leaning groups that I believe are making this group up as a red herring to create a reason to promote fear of Christians . Would you be so kind as to post a link to the Dominionist web site that outlines their agenda to take over the Country ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Just go to Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson and learn what you need to know .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So what you're saying is that you can't produce one objective , independent site or source that is by the Dominionists themselves as evidence that they are an actual existing group or organization . If you could , you would have . This is just one more example of the diabolical agenda of the Radical Left to make people fear Christianity based on more lies and deception . Thanks for revealing who the real paranoid fearmongers are . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Do your own homework , buddy .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Then stop making assertions you can't back up with evidence . I already told you I googled it and found nothing at all by a Dominionist Organization at all . But you implied it's a real group so prove it or else don't attempt to use it as a method of demonizing Christians as a group . The reason why you lefties must lie and cheat to win is because the truth is repugnent and foreign to you . And Samiinh , it's fascinating that you posted that article but declined to post the link . How corrupt are you to with hold the link because it's from a Leftist site that os promoting the lie of the Dominionist's existence without producing any more proof than you did . I could post a link on Google right now asserting that all Lefties of the Socialist , Democratic Party persuasion are in fact Satan Worshipers who sacrifice the babies they kidnap from Republican Christians on an alter to the devil at each full moon . Posting it wouldn't make it true . Even though on its surface it's much more credible than your bogus story about Christian Dominionists . Now post a link with your slanderous article or delete it for the lie that it is .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The Republicans are pushing the " hot-button " issues by appealing to people's ignorance and prejudice , in order to distract them from the important bread and butter issues that directly affect EVERYONE on a daily basis .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Oh , I don't know . Social Security , high taxes , poor schools , terrorism , I'd say these are bread and butter issues to many . Unlike Democrats with their abortion , AA , gay marriage , global warming , yada , yada , yada , BS . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Oh , I'm sorry . Who is it that wants to ban gay rights with a Constitutional Amendment , thus making an issue of it ? Who wants to take the decision to abort away from a woman and her doctor , by banning some rare types of abortions , thus making an issue ? Global warming is an important issue that has the potential to affect everyone . Democrats are conserned about all the issues you have raised . The Democrats certainly did a better job fiscally , keeping the books ballanced , when they were in power . But Republicans care about giving their rich elite friends tax breaks , no matter what the cost . They divide everyone else with fear , ignorance and irrational prejudice . Issues of personal morality divide and distract from seeing what truely affects everyone . It's no place for the government or for a peeping tom God ( unless you personally believe in that God ) . Gay marriage doesn't have an affect anyone's life unless they want it . Abortion doesn't have an affect anyone's life , unless they want one .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>One could argue that if the Left wasn't pushing a radical agenda , no action on the part of the Right would have been necessary . Instead , the Left got some activist judges and politicians to manipulate the system , forcing the need for a mid-stream correction . It's BS , pure and simple . Now , THERE'S some revisionist history . It was a Republican Congress that first balanced the budget after gaining control of the HR for the first time in 40 years . Unfortunately , the legacy costs imposed by the Democratic social engineering make it so the budget will probably never be balanced again . Ah , right out of the liberal handbook . Get some originality , please . You can't cut taxes for people who DON'T pay them , duh ! Sure , it's the Republicans telling Seniors and children that the bad Republicans want to starve them , right ? It's not the likes of Ted Kennedy , Howard Dean , Jesse Jackson , and John Kerry scaring them . ;) I've told you before , I don't care what consenting adults do , just don't **** with marriage . Period . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I don't see how the system was being manipulated . Judges were interpreting a constitution . That's what they do . A legislature can pass a law , but whether or not it's in line with rights guaranteed in a constitution , is another matter . Some of the right-wing are so worried another group of people will get their due constitutional rights , they want to change the constitution to prevent it . Will they do this for other groups who want equal rights ? It's certainly up for debate which side is being more manipulative . You want to impose your personal and religious morality on everyone else , by giving those who don't share your beliefs , fewer rights .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The manipulation came when gays married in Mass attempted to use the " Full Faith and Credit Clause as a means to force the acceptance of gay marriage on te rest of the contry . The Full Faith and Credit Clause was never intended , nor does it apply to marriage laws . The FFaCC holds for court judgements , but not licenses . It's no different that having a driver's license in MI at age 16 , but not being allowed to drive in NY until you're 18 , even if you hold a valid MI driver's license . There are dozens of such precedents for not acknowledging licenses issued in other states . The 10th Amendment says that those rights not specifically given to the Feds belong to the State or individuals . In many states , the people have decided whether or not gay marriage should be allowed and have exercised their 10th Amendment right to self-govern . Now , you can argue all you want about the net effect of that self-governing , but it is entirely constitutional .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Duh ??? What do you mean by that ? ( Hint ; read below my name below . )<br><b> S2:1-  </b>One could only wish that modern liberalism was truly Jeffersonian . If it were , I'd be a liberal too . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>OK . I'll ask you the same question : What do you mean by that ?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Jefferson's views were that democracy was with power of the people . He also understood the need for war when it comes to pursuing , perserving and maintaining liberty ( " the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots & tyrants . It is its natural manure " ) . He believed liberty was threatened by a consolidated , centralized government , which is radically different than liberalism today , which takes the very opposite stance , IMO . Decentralization was a big theme to Jefferson . He would have opposed over-regulation . Liberalism today has abandoned a lot of what Jefferson believed , kept what they prefer , and changed it . There are many aspects of HIS liberalism I would agree with : I like their focus on domestic social issues such as taking care of elderly , making sure there is fairness , freedom for black people , etc. But liberalism as embodied today by the Democratic party has become anti-religion , over-regulatory , and it's been taken over by extremist special interest groups such as the gay lobby and others ( much the same way the Republicans were taken over by the religious right in the 80 s ) . It's a political favor game now , not honest advocacy for the people as Jefferson would have had it . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Are you not doing the exact same thing ? Did you perhaps mean : " I would agree with " " making sure there is fairness " and " honest advocacy " , EXCEPT for gay people . ???<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No , that's why I support equal opportunity for people regardless of their sexual behavior . But I don't support redefining the marriage standard in this country , either . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>OH . So " marriage " is only for hetrosexual people who use sex ONLY for procreation ONLY in the Missionary position ?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>A very well put editorial that asks and question I have wondered a number of times myself , and have brought up before . On Gay Marriage , Media Gives Obama a Pass - Yahoo ! News<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Here is the difference Every Republican presidential candidate wants gay marriage banned and gay people thrown into prison through the reinstatement of sodomy laws . They are very loud and clear on this point . They would put their personal opinions in to law that subjugate gay people . President Obama has said that he believes that marriage is between a man and a woman but he is not willing to put his personal beliefs into law . He has done everything he can to support the marriage equality position . He has said that he favors a system of strong civil unions . Besides if Obama wins reelection then he will come out for full marriage equality . No other president in US history has done more for the gay community the president Obama . He has been our strong advocate in the white house . The problem for you is that you fall on the side of imposing your moral views upon others and can not understand why someone would not want to . They don't give him a pass here is a quote from a press conference . http://www.queerty.com/obama-of-cour...mies-20110629/ <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Oh good grief . Fear-monger much ? Matthew you really need to give up the gay-pride politics blogs and embrace reality for a change .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I hear the sound of the marching of the boots of the brown shirts every time I here any of the Republican candidates speak , even your precious Ron Paul . The Republican candidates all support the re-institution of sodomy laws . Rick Perry even supports the proposed Uganda law , his religion is supporting , that would not only imprison gays but execute them . But once again to the OP Obama is not given a pass on marriage equality it is just that he will never do anything to stop it and will help marriage equality become a reality . The republican candidates all will do everything in their power to stop marriage equality . Here is the pledge they signed http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2011/1...dge/?mobile=nc http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2011/0...rriage-pledge/ <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Nobody is going to imprison or execute gays here in the U.S. Give it a rest . You're in far greater danger in this country simply from economic collapse by staying with Obama than you are any danger of the paranoid delusions you come up with over the gay issue .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Hummm I wonder if you would have said the same thing to the native Americans or the Japanese Americans . It has happened before and can happen again . Do I need to remind you of the hundreds of thousands of native Americans that are dead at the hands of the US military or that the Japanese Americans dragged from their homes and locked away in concentration camps . An don't get me started on institution of slavery that was written into the constitution and lasted for over 80 years under that constitution . Yes these things happened here in the US and if they can happen once who knows what will happen to us . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The point is that they haven't happened since then . Don't worry Matthew , the police aren't blocking the door to your meat markets or favorite hook-up spot . You're free to have all the gay sex you want .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>My point is that if these things have happened once , under the same Constitution we currently have , then they can happen again . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>So what would you do , put a gay-protection amendment in the constitution ?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>In a way . What needs to happen is an amendment that restricts religion and religions role in society .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Give us a break , the bibe saying ' in the future there will be Wars ... and Earthquakes ! ' is hardly proof , that is beyond coincidence predicting that ' things will stay much the same as they are and natural events will occur as usual ' . Abortions an unwed couples seems to have pretty much nothing to do with the last line . As for minorities and the constitution , the majority can change the constitution or just ignore it . It is in the majorities interest to support and accept minorities because pretty much everyone falls within one of them and minorites still have a significant number of people , maybe not the most important but enough to swing power between forces competting over the majority .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The number of earthquales that have happened outside of Israel in the last 100 yrs is exponentially increased . Believe what you will . If you have a better understanding of love waxing cold I'd like to hear it . Obviously we don't have the smae understanding of the US government . Teh majority rules unless it violates the constitution . If you can point out how that isn't true then I'd be interested in being enlightened . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Unless you are a beleiver in a religion , then the whole Earthquake thing is irrelevant and if you are then this isn't the debate for you . I haven't been argued that homosexuality is right according to religious beleifs , but more often that your religious beleifs should have nothing to do with my life . Acceptance of homosexuality effecting plate tectonics ? Time to come back to the real world , even if it is true , why should you worship a being that is quite happy to destroy homes and kill people for becoming more tolerant but is quite happy with the famine and AIDS situation and doesn't get involved with politics ? The constitution is not magic , it has been changed because enough people wanted it done , if the majority wants to ignore or change a part of the consititution it will do .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>First opff Jake started this rel ; igious topic . Reread the posts I'm only refuting his assertions . I did not say homosexuality is the cause of anything religious only citing support against Jake's comments . Don't ever try to assume you know God's mentality . Most parents love their children but they raise them according to how they feel is best . According tro what they know . Why are some parents motivator and others discipliners ? That's my popint if the majority want it they will do it . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And I refute your refutations . You implied that the Earthquakes were not a natural thing and dinviinly caused Even if there is a god , any ' loving parent ' that kills some of its children to make a point , when they are fully capable of just changing the issue anyway is hardly deserving of worship . As for people changing , not only is that dubious anyway but not really proof of anything , there are alcoholics who recover and don't drink and that is definitely genetically influenced . You clearly have no real idea about the state of genetic research or how it works , we are nowhere near finding the purpose of everything . There doesn't appear to be one gene , but there is probably a combination that lead to a greater chance of being gay . @ Rev , Power of Attorney would be fine , but giving that there is already favouritism shown to some people , why should that favouritism be arteficailly restricted . In the interest of fairness it seems a lot easy to recognise a few more people in an existing group that abolishing it . Also not everyone shares your view on the purpose and role of a government<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No you refute your inferences No I didn't Who said God killed them ? For someoen that claims there is no God it's amazing how you're the expert now on the nature of God . i agree there is a disposition but that doesn't mean that they are genetically confined as the alcoholic isn't . So why draw the line at homosexuals ? Why not polygamists ? Why do homosexuals deserve the right and polygamists don't ? What merits do homosexuality bring that polygamy doesn't ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So that little peice of geological trivia was just that , and had nothing to do with this debate or any points whatsoever ? Perhaps some people are capable of thinking from another's point of view , if God is a loving parent I can't see how you can justify the view that anything lethal can be used as a punishment . I don't think you know how genetics works in this instance . Or do you think that the method of upbringing they have is purely responisble ? I don't really see any real problem with polygamy itself , but it would have to be watched a little more carefully perhaps as the cultures that practise polygamy tend to be less focused on equality between sexs . As long as you make sure that the marriages are still volentary for both partners and that any person is fully able to leave if they want to then I can't really see the problem . However it is a lot more complicated if you are looking from the benefits point of view with respect to inheritance and other aspects ( child support and suchlike ) but these are realitively minor points that would just have to be worked out if this type of marriage was to be recognised<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Should they ? What are western standards ? What were they 20 yrs ago ? What were they 100 yrs ago ? Marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Where would that put families started by artificial insemination ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The same as any other heterosexual couple . It's not the way children are created ( adopted , serrogacy , etc ) . It ' s the nature of the relationship ( heterosexual ) . Natural refers to nature not child bearing .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>which god enforces marriage rules when the cermony is performend by a judge ? There was a tribe in the Congo that allowed it . Their shamans told them that the warriors could only marry outer warriors . To be with a women , they thought , might make then softer , and more woman like , and not as fearless in combat . Ok , so conceiving a child is not what makes it nature , what is it ? Wouldn    t polygamy also include some of that same sex taboo , to women marred together ? Why do you feel your values are right and others that disagree as wrong ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Polygamy is not women married together . It's one man or women married to multiple of the opposite sex like a harem or entourage . Everyone feels their values are right or else they wouldn't believe in them . What we value shows . Of course atheist don't believe in God so they have a different set of values . I of course believe in God first , family second , and country third . If you have different values then of course you will think yours are better if not then you wouldn't have them . Our values are what guide us . I feel that from perspective my values give someone a better balance and stability to function in society . You probably think otherwise but I feel statistically I can support mine .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Sorry , I don    t practice Polygamy ; I don    t know the inner workings of the family . I would think it would be a good way for bi-sexual to stay below the radar . I worded the question badly ; I should have asked why do you feel that your morals should be forced on to others ? By keeping the laws the way they are now it is discrimination . Correct me if I am wrong , but I did not think you could fire some one for being gay . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>It's all good I didn't think you knew what you were talking about anyways ? The questions is why should they force their moral on us ? Should we let other people like nudist and rapist force their mroals on us ?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>How is allowing them to marry    forcing there morals on us    ? Yes we would have to deal with the fact of it , but the US has been dealing with the fact of Polygamy fro years . There is only one case that was prosecuted in recent history ( that was mostly due to one of his    wives    being 14 when married . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>When society legalizes behavior it is in fact accepting it as non-detrimental and accepting it . It is a form of forcing our society to accept the behavior .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You're late . I didn't bring up religon in my argument . Jake did . So please don't specualte anything until you knwo what we're talking about . All laws are based upon morals . So it is based upon the morals of the country whcih happen to be predominantly Christian . England was one of many countries . There is no new family structure that didn't exist before this country . My definition of negative effect is that the puposes for which something is created is hindered or compromises . By changing standards there is a harm to it's integrity . Intregrity is compromised when it isn't stable . Soemthing that changes all teh time loses that integrity like John Kerry on his views . Things must remain consistent to be integral . This argument has a flaw . That when there is guaranteed religous freedomw then we dont ' have equal rights . Everyone has equal rights in terms of believing . However behavior is regualted by the government . Therefore we can do anyting in the name of religion until it violates behavior that is acceptable by society .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Fine , so what if the government said people are free to ' believe ' in God , but any sign of them putting their belief into practice , such as going to church or even just praying in private was illegal ? Would that be acceptable ? After all it is just regulating behaviourA , not belief ? Your comparisons are ludicrous . All of these situations involve non-consensual acts either through lack of knowledge or involvement of minors . You cannot compare that to consensual acts between adults . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That probably wouldn't be acceptable to most people but it would be legal and equal . They don't allow religious practices of polygamy , animal or human sacrifices , body mutilation , and many other religious practices . So then we should allow prostitution , polygamy , human trafficking , drug trafficking , gambling , drug distribution , and all other consensual acts .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But they obviously wouldn't be equal , because a significant proportion of the population would be restricted from worshipping how they want in a for that hurts nobody . These elements mostly have links to crime over and above the act itself , that justifies restrictions . Homosexuality doesn't . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The poeple would be equal . The religions would not . Look at our country . Almost all Christian beleifs are legal and no other non-Christians Churches have almost all their legal beleifs . That's it ? Crime ? That's it . The criminal link ? So if they criminalized homosexuality then it would be okay to ban gay marriage . Homosexuality has links to crime too . Sodomy is a crime . Define harm becaue homosexuality is harmful according to many .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>This is not equality . You are using the letter of the law to twist the purpose of the law , and even then doing it using very shaky logic . Equality is about general concepts , not specifics . It is equality to say ' everyone is has the same right to worship who they want ' , it is not equality to say ' everyone has the same right to worship who we tell them to ' . That is equality within an unequal system , which cannot be counted . Can you re-phrase , I don't follow . No . As I said , those have strong links to criminal activity irrespective of the act itself being a crime . For example drug use has noted links to theft , the same just cannot be said for homosexuality . No it isn't . And even if it was , that has nothing to do with homosexuality anyway . Physical or psychological injury or damage . Homosexuality is therefore in no way harmful . And I have serous doubts about the ' many ' who say it is . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Equality is treating every person the same . However it does not mean treating every person's behavior the same . It does not mean treat every organization the same either . Everyone has the same rights . NOt every religous practice , ideology , or behavior get the same treatment . Teh people determine what is in the public's interest to protect and ban . It basically only the Christian practices that are completely legal . Islamic polgamy and other religons don't have their practices recognized as often as christianity . Homosexuality has strong links to sodomy . Also prostitution is legal in Nevada so shoudl all states be forced to allow taht behavior ? Insome states adults cann have sex wiht 14 - 16 yr olds in some cases . Should other states recognize that too ? Most serial killers of men and young boys were homosexuals . Sodomy is a crime do you wnat me to post it ? gynocologist , Gi specialists , and colon specialist have all stated the effects homosexual related activites . Also there is a higher risk of disease transmission among homosexual men so much so they are not allowed to donate blood for 5 yrs from their last activity .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It's a consideration for many reasons . It's a tremendous NEW tax on businesses , the Social Security System and Healthcare systems because this would create a new " dependent class " that doesn't presently exist . Make no mistake about it , Gay marriage IS about ECONOMICS . Any claims to the contrary are simply false .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Are you saying that gay people who pay into the same systems , shouldn't also benefit ? Speaking of dependency , imagine a scenario where a gay person is in a same-sex marriage , that is not legally recognized . This person is also dependent on the other spouse . The marriage breaks up . Now , the taxpayer must support the dependent partner , because the marriage was not legally recognized . If it were legal , the richer partner could have been made to support the poorer one , after divorce . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Same sex marriage marriage partners that aren't legally mrried are called ROOMMATES . Do we want to start giving benefits to all singles sharing apartments regardless of sexual bent ?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That is a separate issue , and could also involve different sex people . We are not talking about singles , or roomates , when we talk of marriage . I don't see roomates sharing an apartment arguing for such a recognition or responsibility . As much as many trust and care for their roomates , it's not by that much . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No , we're not talking about marriage . We're talking about a relationship that some want us to all believe is a marriage . Well , if I want to marry my dog , can I ? Of course I can't . It all goes back to the definition of marriage and Jack and Jack ain't it .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Here we go again . If these types of arguments are the best the right wing can come up with and just repeat and repeat ad nauseum , then good luck . In Mass . , in Ontario , in British Columbia , in Quebec , in Belgium and the Netherlands , Jack and Jack are it . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I'm not a Right Winger . Right Wingers are way too far Left for me . I'm a Jeffersonian Liberal . I believe in the Constitution as written . They're only allowed in Mass . because the " people's will " hasn't been heard yet . The majority of Americans are against same sex marriage , no matter how you try to spin it , so I'm guessing that the laws will be solidified so that any ambiguity is removed very soon . As for Canada and the Netherlands , I could care less . I don't live or pay a dime in taxes to support either .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Are you speaking of the federal marriage ammendment to the U.S. Constitution ? Everything I've heard indicates it's a long shot . At any rate , it is just a guess what will or won't happen a few years in the future . I was just pointing out what was happening internationally ( Mass . is international for me , a Canadian ) .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What sex isn't behaviour ? Polygamy is not more acceptable by the standards of Western society . I'm not sure I would call it a significant factor of contemporary Western society . It is significant in patriarchal societies . No court or government in Western society has recognized marriage rights for polygamists .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Should they ? What are western standards ? What were they 20 yrs ago ? What were they 100 yrs ago ? Marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It's not just for a heterosexual contract in the Netherlands , Belgium , most of Canada , and probably not limited that way for much longer in Sweden and Spain . It won't be just for a heterosexual contract in Mass . in May . There are married heterosexual couples who either choose to not have children , or cannot have children . So it is not just for having a family unit with children either .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This isn't europe . There dirinking laws , prostituition laws , and many other laws are different than ours . SO are many other countries . If we want to talk about the world the over 90% of the world doesn't recognize homosexuality . Mass is taking stpes to ban it . Hawaii did the same thing in 1997 and their legislature stopped it . I believe Mass will do the same . A family is the basic unit in society traditionally consisting of two parents rearing their own or adopted children ; also : any of various social units differing from but regarded as equivalent to the traditional family < a single-parent family > . We're talking about traditional families . A family can be just a wife and husband . It can't be two husbands . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Well , Europe or Canada is more similar to the U.S. than Iran or Saudi Arabia or Namibia . Any steps will take years , after the legal marriages have already taken place , if those steps are even successful . Single parent families are not generally viewed as traditional .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yeah this country is more similar to Anglo countries . What's your point ? What happens in 2050 when they predict minorites will be over 50% of this country ? Hawaii did it in a year . But it is veiwed as natural <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Look at the current hoity-toity polls which show strong support for gay rights among those 18 - 29 . I don't see polygamy as a value among minorities in the U.S. Hawaii was different , as the legislature made changes against marriage for gays , while the stayed decision was being appealed to the Supreme Court . So is casual sex and rabies . We don't judge something as good simply because it is natural . Single parenthood is not viewed as the moral traditional ideal among conservatives .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>They don't ask them about polygamy . Also gays rights is more political than anything else . It doesn't really matter does it . We'll see in the end who's right . Single parent is natural . Many husbands die early . That's natural . unwed mothers is not considered moral but it's still natural . Casual sex is natural but not rational . It will lead to other problems . Rabies are viruses . Rabies aren't even alive so how can you call that natural ?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The number of earthquales that have happened outside of Israel in the last 100 yrs is exponentially increased . Believe what you will . If you have a better understanding of love waxing cold I'd like to hear it . Obviously we don't have the smae understanding of the US government . Teh majority rules unless it violates the constitution . If you can point out how that isn't true then I'd be interested in being enlightened .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>LOL . :p OK , if you say so . Waxy <br><b>S1:2-  </b>looked at the lists of " World's Most Dangerous Earthquakes and Selected Earthquakes in the United States " from The Citizen's Guide to Geologic Hazards . I thought it best to look just at the larger earthquakes to reduce the dependence on instruments and observers . There has been about 20 large earthquakes globally in the latter half of this century ( so far ) compared to about 15 for the first half of this century . There were only 7 large earthquakes recorded for the entire 19th century . Based on this quick look at one source of information , it does appear that the frequency of earthquakes is increasing .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Mana'ia , I can only shake my at you sometimes . :( Did the idea of how they detect and record earthquakes taking exponential leaps forward ever occur to you ? Of course not , you saw a stat that you liked , from one source , and without any critical thought at all , you immediately accepted it as being solid truth / evidence and based an entire argument on it . It is rather typical of your posts though . Waxy <br><b>S1:3-  </b>ACtually I did take taht fact inot consideration . The new methoods detect min or earthquakes and mostly do it in remote places . I'm talking ab out teh major earthquakes taht could be detected wihtout a seizmograph in the major countries in the civilized world . The evidence of teh earthquakes that could be measured in the 1800 s in teh countries documented compared to thiose same earthquakes now are expontially increasing . We doin ; t need to count the minor ones in remote places . Go to ANY and ALL sources and count them . I did my research but you obviously didn't . Still remember that you also are only specualting thqat it the reason for more .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Mana'ia , See my first response to your earthquake nonsense . Research hey Waxy <br><b>S1:4-  </b>That is the only argument you have but it isn't supported by the facts . Show me if you can that it isn't . Also you're only specualting especially after you claimed it wasn't true .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I only have limited time to debate , so I have to pick my battles , so I'll pass on this one . I will make one point here . Heterosexual marriage is one of the most universal of all human institutions , found in almost all cultures ever existing . With a precedent like that , the question isn't , " Why Mr. Galton are you opposed to gay marriage ? " The question is how do you justify revolutionizing that ancient institution ? To me , heterosexual marriage is the Parthenon : ancient , beautiful , crumbling some of late , but it would be a tragedy to knock it down , clear it out , and put in a new building . You prove to me why that new building is so gotdamn necessary .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It is circular to say marriage has simply always been heterosexual , end of debate . No one is talking about knocking down marriage . Gay families want to enter into it , because they want their families strengthened and protected as heterosexual families have been strenghtened and protected . Gay families want into the institution because they want to be a positive influence on it , to support it and to shore it up , not because they desire to harm it . They are fighting to get into it , as some heterosexuals can't wait to get out of it . I can't see if it would make such a dramatic change just because the couple are the same sex . Also marriage in the U.S. and Canada falls under common-law . This is a " living law " meant to evolve with society , with much room for interpretation by judges . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You're gonna have to explain your circularity argument for us slow folks . And you're gonna have to back up your statement that gays as a group are really in their hearts conservatives , with a love of traditional institutions like marriage . I strongly suspect that you have some homosexuals who want the right to marriage for romantic reasons , some who want it for economic / legal privilege reasons , but also very many who want it so as to affirm that homosexuality is just as good as heterosexuality . It's the idea of we're just as good as you are , so we must be able to have everything you can have . For many , I suspect it is not a desire to adopt a more conservative lifestyle , but to make a point , and move the culture toward greater acceptance . This is a risky gamble to shove this down peoples ' throats as it may cause a backlash instead of greater legitimization of the lifestyle . Oh and you've got to be kidding me that gay marriage doesn't revolutionize marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Takes us back to where we started , assumes it absolutely must be and cannot be different or change . Sure , there are many who want acceptance from society , parents , friends , and that is a big reason why they marry , for gays or straights . If gays want their marriages to compete with heterosexual marriages , to prove gay marriages can be more successful , wouldn't that be good for the institution ? The old fashioned backlash argument is not a reason to not do something , and frankly is a little tired and worn-out in 2004 . Gays are just as good as you are . Is there a problem with gays believing and acting like they are just as good ? We don't have the strong sense of different gender roles we once had , so why is it such a revolutionary change ? I can't see that it has revolutionized the societies where it is in effect . It could have represented the next step in a very gradual continuation of acceptance that had been going on for a long time . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I am not arguing that heterosexual marriage must be as it has been or cannot be different . I am arguing that that revolutionizing such an important , ancient institution requires some heavy justification . People who have no respect for the past may not find my point compelling ; people who look to the past with deep respect and see in it old wisdom will find it compelling . I for one do not want to revolutionize an ancient institution I have great respect for , in order so the gay community can prove something . Tired argument ?! My god , how long have we been debating gay marriage ? Only four or five years ago in grad school , we were discussing how difficult it would be to see more and more rights to be extended to cohabiting gays couples , and we talked a little bit about gay civil unions . Marriage wasn't even on the damn table ! Homosexuality is an eccentricity ; in my mind it is not equal in value to heterosexuality . This is not an issue of how gays believe and act ; it is an issue of whether we are going to enshrine homosexual marriage as we do with heterosexual marriage . Gender , sexuality , and family organization are absolutely fundamental aspects of society -- always have been , always will be .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes , the hetero-only definition of marriage has been around a long time . However , simply because something is traditional does not make it just . Well that's how you see it because of your contempt for the gay community . You see it as " them " trying to step out of their lower place , or prove they are not lower than you and equal in value . Your last comment I've dealt with in this post , demonstrates that very well . Yes , the backlash threat is tired and boring . No one is listening anymore . Well , I remember people talking about marriage for gays and lesbians and their rights for much longer . Well , that says it all about where you are coming from . You believe homosexuals are human beings of lesser value . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I believe homosexual behavior is an eccentricity and not equal in value to heterosexuality . I was not referring to the value of persons ; I think homosexuals have as much intrinsic value as anyone else . I have contempt for no one . Your attempt to paint people who disagree with you as haters is unfair and a cheap debate tactic .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Homosexuals are persons who have homosexual behaviour . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>We are all sophisticated enough to separate behavior from person . I don't have to tell you that homosexuals are MUCH more than whom they prefer to sleep with .<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Yes , there is also homosexual orientation , which is part of the person's homosexual identity , and part of the person's homosexuality . The orientation leads to the behaviour .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>They did leave in a very key statement in the provision essentially making it non-mandatory to some extent : " But it also says marriage officers need not perform a ceremony between same-sex couples if doing so would conflict with his or her " conscience , religion and belief . " ( http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/1...8LCTCSG0.html) At least they've recognized that making officials do that may be infringing on their religious freedom .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The link doesn't work . This is unfortunate if it applies to public officials . I believe public officials are there to serve all members of the public , equally under the law . That's their job . I'm glad they have to do their job in Canada . Would you want a public servant to refuse you because he or she does not share your Evangelical beliefs , jyoshu ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I certainly would NOT want someone forced to do something against their religious beliefs . If I went to a public official and it were against their religious belief to perform a heterosexual civil ceremony , I'd simply find someone that would , rather than try to force that person to do it . Here's the corrected link , by the way : http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/11/14/D8LCTCSG0.html<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If one can't do the job , one should look for another job . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Apparently not , in South Africa . I don't see why marriage freedom should automatically trump religious freedom , and apparently SA feels the same way .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Do you agree with me then , that this is an impediment to the public servant doing his or her job ? This is nonsense . I'm glad I live in Canada , where the religion of others is not imposed into my life .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>DOMA isn't unconstitutional . SCOTUS has not ruled on it . I think that little cretin Obama or even Holder should be impeached for making up their own laws and ignoring what has already been passed by a wide majority . And the pro-gay-sex heathens ought to be educated or deported .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You know we gay people are the life blood of this Country . We are some of the most dedicated , hard working , talented people that sets us apart in our own unique ways . And in case you've been wondering where I have been . I just officially aced my Conductor's Promotion exam with a 98% for the Burlington Northern And Santa Fe Railway . So I suppose if you want to deport me you better find someone else to haul that boxcar full of Bible's you ordered to pollute the minds of ignorant people in Uganda .... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>26 Because of this , God gave them over to shameful lusts . Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones . 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another . Men committed shameful acts with other men , and received in themselves the due penalty for their error . 28 Furthermore , just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God , so God gave them over to a depraved mind , so that they do what ought not to be done . - Romans chapter 1 Wise up .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So all you can do is copy and paste some lame bible quote to justify your prejudice and hatred toward gays ? Figures . Your pathetic when it comes to giving credibility for your slanted views of others .. I find it Ironic you'd even say that ... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>My views are slanted and yours aren't ? Go tell that tripe to your pet carp . You're one day closer to the Pit and you haven't wised up yet . No wonder you're lost .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Sorry , last time I checked my rights as an American Citizen weren't dictated by the Bible or ANY " holy " book for that matter . You want to impose a christian state where the good old boys have their glory days back , McCarthyism runs rampant , and the paddy-wagons line the streets just waiting to pick up your version of " degenerates . " Your views do NOTHING positive for this Country . They do nothing to empower American Citizens , their crude , damning , repetitive , and non productive in any way shape or form ... In other words , you may as well grow a beard and stand at a military funeral with Freddy because that's all it looks like your good for . Someone for people to shake their head and their fist at ...<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The court upheld equal protections . You accuse the court of illegitimate " judicial activism " for upholding such protections . Obviosly so far as you are concerned , if equal protections are upheld for gay Americans , it's illegitimate . Obviously not in the states that prohibit it . Can't you read the laws ? Indeed , the state and federal laws on the issue are specifically directed against gay people . It is woefully disingenuous of you to pretend otherwise . Another case of malicious disingenuity . Not even you can take it seriously with a straight face that these laws don't exist because gay people insist on equal rights , and homophobes want to deny them . If you don't know what equality means , by all means invest in a dictionary . Then you haven't much understanding of it . It applies to this case , and there are a large number of court decisions that agree with this understanding , this being just the latest . The straw men are all in your posts .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why can't you answer my question ? I simply said that it is illegitimate to say the constitution means one thing when it never has . I certainly can and there is nothing saying they can't within the restrictions by the law . Perhaps you don't . Let's look at marriage as an example . Marriage restrictions based on age , sex , species , number of , capacity , and perhaps a few other things . If you want " equal protection " the way you define it then all of these restrictions ( short of capacity ) would have to be removed . Is this what you mean by equal protection ? There seems to be more that disagree with you but that is beside the point . The only way you get to equal protection meaning what you want it to mean is if you evolve the constitution to a new meaning . If you can prove to me how gay marriage was part of the original meaning of the term " equal protection " then I'd be very much impressed . nice response Can you show me where I made a strawman ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Oh dear . I suppose I am extremely stupid in thinking that when a constitution says equal protections under the law , it means equal protections under the law . Evidently , it means : " Except gays " .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Can you show a document that suggests the original meaning of " equal protection " means equality for gays but not for other groups ? If you like I can explain the original understanding of the 14th amendment and how it wouldn't apply to gays unless they were denied marriage as defined today for being gay . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Can you show us a document that shows equality applies to groups other than gays ? Where does the Constitution say , " Except gays " ? Do you seriously imagine gay people want to marry the opposite sex ? Do you seriously think it is not an obstacle to their pursuit of life , liberty and happiness to prevent them from marrying the partners they love ? After all , you folk take your right to marry the consenting adults you love for granted , but for some pig-headed reason , you think it's OK to deny gay Americans the same rights you have . And you think that's constitutional ? Steve , that's bigotry .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are borderline breaking the rules of the forum . That aside , did you want me to explain the meaning of equal protection or not ? If it makes you feel better I wouldn't think it was denial of equal protection if marriage was denied as two men or two women marrying each other . No , they can't marry each other . Not sure how that is protection but if it is then consider gays protected too . I'm not saying you should think the way I do but at least I am trying to answer your questions and respond to your points . All you seem to be doing is ignoring my posts and insulting me . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>yawn . But since that is the denial of equal rights , obviously you would be wrong to think that . Nope . A very disingenuous argument . Gay partnerships are NOT protected the same way as straight ones -- in many places , they are illegal . That would be obvious even to a blind man , but not to someone deliberately denying the facts . I am pointing out that your opinions are wrong . As to why you make the erroneous arguments you do , i can only surmise .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No because in that case everyone is still allowed to marry under what marriage means . so is a daughter and father relationship which was the topic at hand ... Why are they wrong ? Why can't you explain why denial of some things that aren't equal is ok and doesn't violate equal protection but with gay marriage it does ? It is this question that makes or breaks your entire argument .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Yes , I think they should stone Vitter and Craig on the Capitol Steps . Don't know if they'll find the hooker that Vitter was with , or the man Craig did in Union Station or not , but if they do ... they must be stoned as well .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Won't they get arrested on drug charges for helping somebody to get stoned on the capital steps ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Hmmm .... hadn't thought about that . But here's another tale of the sanctity of christian marriage . At age 17 , Fred Thompson knocked up his 18 year old girlfriend , Sarah Lindsey . Her family agreed to let him marry her , and helped him through college and law school , then got him a job in one of the family law firms . They had three children and were married for 26 years . They were divorced in the mid 80 s . His oldest child would be older than his second wife . One of his children from the first marriage apparently died from a drug over dose ( which is truly sad event ) . Now he has two more children , one four and one not a year , at age 65 . He claims to be a member of the Churches of Christ , another religious cult , but no one can say what church he attends or when ( rather like Bush and the Alabama Air National Guard ) . James Dobson says Thompson is not really a christian . Oh well .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So does Dobson think the man is just acting <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Does Dobson THINK ?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Hard to say , but I do believe he thinks about his own well being and economic status . On issues the evidence is difficult to assess .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It has nothing to do with marriage equality . It is redefining the very meaning of marriage to allow gays to ' marry ' .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And that is a bad thing ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not necessarily but I wish some gay posters on here would be honest and not just use the words ' equality ' and ' discrimination ' when they obviously do not apply .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Lets see I can't legally marry the person of my choice but a heterosexual can and that is not discrimination and that is some how being equal to a heterosexual ? If it is not discrimination then what is it oatmeal cookies ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You cant seem to get it into your head that marriage is an institution that was created to be a union between a man and a woman that leads to the couple creating children within a stable nuclear family . Gays have nothing to do with it . Marriage has nothing to do with two blokes giving each other a wedding ring and being able bolster their self esteem by kidding themselves they are as normal as straights .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>That is only your opinion , and apparently you have never been to Las Vegas . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The last sentence could be seen as only an opinion but the rest of the post is indisputable<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Come on , Matthew , that's a lame argument . People are born black , but they can control their zippers so they can avoid engaging in gay sex sin .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>you think gay people have a choice in being gay or not ? in that case , do i have a choice in being sexually attracted to females or males ? AAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA ! no ! <br><b>S1:2-  </b>If gays don't have any CHOICE in engaging in illicit gay sex sin then you'd darn well better be on your guard in shopping malls and street corners . ROTFLOL !<br><b> S2:2-  </b>im talking about sexual attraction , you burke . being gay or straight isnt a choice , it just happens . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Unzipping their pants for illicit gay sex , in violation of the Word of God , is a choice , snicklefritz .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>so gay people should just stay celebate for their entire lives because you dont like what they do . well done .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I really wish that you would read my posts before commenting . I have clearly stated that gay marriages should not be prohibited . I am stating .. and you have posted nothing to make me think otherwise ... that gay marriage is simply not the same as hetero marriage and to recognise this is not to discriminate against it . If gays are allowed to marry then any kind of marriage between consenting adults should be allowed .. otherwise you are discriminating against the person wanting to enter into the marriage , however distasteful it appears to you .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I have been with my partner for 15 years . I am having my own biological twin baby boys due this December . Do you not think that we are a family that deserves all the same protections of heterosexual couples ? So you consider my children less deserving of the same protections just because one of us does not have a vagina ? What is the difference in my family and other families ? We have two parents and will be the parents of two children with full custody . Please if you can describe to me what makes my family less deserving of full protections and what makes us different besides the fact that one of us does not have a vagina . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You seem to like pointing out that one of you doesnt have a vagina . I think I guessed that . I have news for you ... there is no penis in a lesbian Ask me the same question minus the BS and I will attempt to answer it<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I smell the BS and it's not coming from me . Here ya go . I have been with my partner for 15 years . I am having my own biological twin baby boys due this December . Do you not think that we are a family that deserves all the same protections of heterosexual couples ? So you consider my children less deserving of the same protections just because one of us is not a woman ? What makes my family any different and less deserving of equal protections including marriage than any other families ? We have two parents and will be the parents of two children with full custody . Please if you can describe to me what makes my family less deserving of the full protections given to that of heterosexual headed households and what makes us different besides the fact that one of us is not a woman ( is that better ) . What reason would you give to my children as to why they are less deserving than other children ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You deserve as much protection as an incestuous / polygamous or any other sexually deviant relationship that has outsourced their children . Hope this helps . Please tell me who forced you into outsourcing children ? If no one did then you are responsible for your children , not me .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>My children are in no way " outsourced " as they are my biological children . No one is asking for YOU to care for my children as I have all the same taxes and other responsiblities to my government as you do . Please try to answer my question as to why my family is less deserving of government benefits than a heterosexual headed household . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Depends on your circumstances . They may be more deserving of government benefits than some heterosexual households . Do you need to marry your partner to recieve these benefits ? Are you more deserving than a single parent that deliberately has a clutch of children then moans because of lack of government support ?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>With full civil marriage equality , a whole host of benefits are brought about to strengthen my family such as survivors benefits for social security as just one example . Another example would be my husband , given that marriage equality were a reality , would automatically gain guardianship of our children were anything to happen to me . These of course are only a couple of the more than a thousand benefits marriage brings about . Certainly , you may argue that contracts drawn by a paid attorney or myself could reap these same benefits , but I do not understand what legitimate reason my family must jump through these hoops when heterosexual headed households are not required , asked or even expected to do the same . Two parents , two children , participating and supporting equally with our governments requirements as any other family , however receiving no reciprocation from the government to strengthen and protect my famly as It does heterosexual headed families . And no , I am certainly not more deserving than anyone else . We do not nor have not ever asked for a handout of any kind anymore than saying that a heterosexual headed household is asking for a handout when the parents are married . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>As you pointed out , it is only heterosexual couples that get to marry and reap the benefits from it . In a modern secular society there is no reason not to extend marriage to other forms of relationships . However just extending marriage to gay couples is not enough , it must be extended to all permutations of sexual relationships and society must look at sexual relationships that are otherwise banned . I cannot see why marriage should be granted to you but an incestuous relationship be illegal . Making homosexual sex legal is a far cry to making gay relationships officially equal to hetero ones . You are no ' better ' than two half brothers having a sexual relationship or a mother and son ..o r indeed a polygamous gay relationship ... it all deviates from the present definition of marriage . If you get it , everyone should get it .<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Would you agree that each form of proposed marriage arrangements would need to be argued on their own merits separately ? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Yes bit it should be considered in one package . I dont see why gays should have their relationships officialised ( is that a word ? ) and pull up the ladder so other types of relationships cannot follow . Before gay marriage is allowed then all types of sexual relationships should be considered . Lets face it , it would be far harder for people to accept a complete revolution in what we consider to be an appropriate relationship to become an official family than to just allow gays to do it ... using the very arguments that gays have to justify them officially marrying we can justify most other type of marriage . So to prohibit other forms of marriage would be tantamount to discrimination<br><b>S1:1-  </b>As I already stated Kerry expected to carry Ohio and got smashed there ........ Ohio passed a Gay marriage amendment and the silent majority spoke there as they did through out the U.S. re electing President Bush by 3 million a bigger margin then " Slick Willie " ever got .........<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This statement seems incorrect in too many ways for me to let it stand . First , to assume that the majority of people in Ohio were either silent about their views on same-sex marriage or on their choice for president is utter nonsense . They were absolutely as loud-mouthed about it as anyone else . Your implications that there is some " silent majority " imply a misunderstanding of the political battlefield , and I hope I have been able to clear it up . Next , although Bush won by a larger margin than Bill Clinton ( who you term " slick Willie " for no other reason than to anger and insult his supporters , I assume ? ) , this does not mean that Clinton did not win by a larger percentage . Remember that population increases over time , and there was a slightly higher voter turnout in this election due to its controversy . Even though Bush by a large number of voters compared to previous elections , he won by a marginal percentage due to the fact that the population of the US has increased . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Actually the population growth has nothing to do with the margin of victory ... I am talking about the votes President Bush won by and " Slick Willie " did not even get a 50 percent majority in either the 1992 and the 1996 election ......... He was very lucky that Perot ran in 1992 otherwise Bush would have defeated him ....... I am sure you have heard the term silent majority before ......... These are the people that when they vote make all the polls that the left wing media put out like the presidents approval rating is down or how bad the economy is or how bad the war in Iraq is going .......... If you think that morals and the gay marriage issue had no bearing in the president winning Ohio then you are living in a state of denial my friend ........<br><b> S2:2-  </b>In 2000 , Gore had 48.4% of the popular vote , while Bush had 47.9% . That gives Bush a negative . 5% in popular vote . In 2004 , Bush had 51% of the popular vote while Kerry had 48.1% . That gives Bush a victory by 2.9% of the popular vote . In comparison , Clinton in 1992 had 43% of the vote while Bush Sr. had 37.4% of the vote , which gives Clinton a win by 5.6% . In 1996 , Dole had 40.7% of the vote while Clinton had 49.2% of the vote , which gives Clinton the win by 8.5% . Clinton clearly had far greater victories than Bush ever did , the difference was that there was a competent third candidate running in both of Clinton's wins . http://mediamatters.org/items/200411150007 I have heard the term silent majority in the past , but it cannot refer to a majority which was not silent . The majority in Ohio ( and all of those other 11 states ) was in fact very , very vocal . Every poll was accurate . The term " silent majority " is not appropriate . I have no doubt that majority's desire to oppress the minority did play some factor in Bush's win in Ohio , but statistics suggest that it was a very small part . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Just for your information getting a majority of the vote means over 50 percent ........ Why was Kerry so sure he was going to win Ohio ? It is becasue the silent majority stood up big time ...........<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I did not say that this is not what the majority means . I was addressing the implications of your post , which is that Bush was more supported than Clinton . That is untrue . And why was Bush so sure he was going to win Michigan ? Actually Bush wasn't so sure he was going to win Michigan , and Kerry wasn't so sure he was going to win Ohio . Asking why Kerry was so sure he was going to win Ohio assumes the false premise that Kerry was so sure he was going to win it . In fact , he was not . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>President Bush did not win Michigan in 2000 and it would have been and upset if he won it 2004 but in every state that he lost in 2000 he picked up a bigger percent of the vote in 2004 ........ And amazing statitistic ..........<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Indeed protesting made a difference , but it didn't happen until enough people came on board . All the protesting in the world wouldn't have brought it about if the will of the people were not changing to make it happen . At the end of the day , any legislative movement needs the will of the people to be successful . It may not need a full majority in some cases , but it needs enough people on board . That's why legislation requires not only voting ( by legislature ) , but elected officials to do so as well . There was a process our country went through on those issues as whether or not they were legitimate in terms of the law -- it involved a national debate , protests , etc. Sometimes this process results in our country ( the people ) granting civil rights legislation , and sometimes it doesn't ( depending on whether it is deemed warranted ) . The process ( which will undoubtedly take years ) is going on right now in regards to gays . Time will tell what the result will be . Any form of legislation is a voting matter . That's the way our system works .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why is it that whenever this comes up you insist on conflating " the people voting on a law " with " the legislature voting on a law " or " the people electing politicians " ? Why can't you simply discuss the topic at hand ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>In what way do you feel it is not the issue at hand ? Matthew asked about voting on his civil rights and this is all part of the voting process .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>In exactly the way I just said . He asked about people voting on laws , not legislators voting on laws . Again , why can't you answer that question ; why do you feel that it's necessary to move the topic around ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Fair enough ; but regardless , the point still stands -- people voting on laws is indeed allowed under our system . ( Ballot initiatives . ) It is all part of the process I mentioned to Matthew of society determining its standards . If you have a beef with the people being able to work toward determining our society's standards ( through voting on such issues ) , then if I were you I'd take it up with the govt .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Or we could take it up here , like Matthew did , and discuss it . Or at least try to , and hope someone doesn't derail the conversation into irrelevant issues like how the legislature works . I will echo the point that several have made here . The idea of allowing the masses to determine civil rights is stupid and wrong . If a group's civil rights need protecting , then they need protecting from the very masses that are doing the voting . Ballot measures may be a legal process , but that doesn't prevent them from being stupid and wrong , now does it ? That's the point that's trying to be made here . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well , that's up to you . If you don't want to derail it , you don't have to . It seems to me that what is really happening in society with these ballot initiatives and other parts of the process is determining whether or not it is a civil right in the first place to give legal marriage to whatever group arrangement is in question . ( In this case , gays couples . ) That process has to take place ; it is just not feasible in our society to give marriage equality to any group of any arrangement that comes along demanding it until we determine for certain that it needs to be done . If society determines that same-sex arrangements of two people should suffice to redefine marriage for it to be included , then so be it . But that process has to be there in some form , realistically . If you are going to draw the line in terms of what can be voted on a ballot initiative or not , what authority determines that ? How are you going to determine where that line is drawn ? And you can't just arbitrarily say " when civil rights are being infringed " because that doesn't carry any legal weight -- it's opinion . Just saying it's " stupid " and " wrong " may be your point being made , but it's a point that doesn't offer any solutions .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You really are a piece of work . All you're saying here is that if society wants to be bigoted it should be allowed to be . Very libertarian of you , but I believe that if the power of the government can be used to fight evil and prejudice , it should . If wrong is happening , and the government can stop it , it should . You will of course claim that the government can't do anything , but history has proven that position wrong . The government has taken stands against biggotry before , and while it hasn't eradicated it , it has improved things . Gee , now I'm supposed to offer solutions before you even get what the point is ? I'm I allowed to use both hands while I type ? Any other restrictions you want to add ?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>[ QUOTE = gaetano ; 255273 ] As you say , marriage is a public institution and like all institutions has its rules and requirements . If you want to change those rules and requirements then by all means lobby to do so . You are entitled to do so . Equally people who do not wish to change the rules and regulations are entitled to lobby to keep the status quo . You only BELIEVE gays have the right to marriage . Other people BELIEVE they do not . Ask for a vote on it and abide by the majority decision .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Isn't cruel and unjust to decide that someone else should not have what you enjoy ? How would you feel if the world was the other way around . How would you feel if the world were gay and you as a heterosexual were being told you couldn't marry the person you loved because it was against someone elses , that you didn't know or have never met , religious beliefs or that they have some sort of ikk factor ? Can you not put youself in the place of gay people and ask yourself how would I feel ? Do you have any empathy ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>In answer to your first question as it stands , No , it happens all the time . If society had set up the institution of marriage as a gay one since OG was in his cave then I would certainly try and lobby otherwise if I disagreed . If the lobbying failed and the rest of Society said we keep things the way we want them however sorry they may feel , then I would clearly have to abide by that , although lobbying would continue . However castigating people because of their beliefs or stating they shouldn't have them , must be wrong . Otherwise I could claim that you are not entitled to your beliefs which clearly you are<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That is not what I asked you . Do you really lack any empathy ? I didn't ask you what you would do I asked you how you would feel . Let's try again How would you feel if the world was the other way around ? How would you feel if the world were gay and you as a heterosexual were being told you couldn't marry the person you loved because it was against someone elses , that you didn't know or have never met , religious beliefs or that they have some sort of ikk factor ? Can you not put youself in the place of gay people and ask yourself how would I feel ? Do you have any empathy ? For the record I do not believe I have the right to tell anyone who they should be allowed to marry but many of those that are anti same sex marriage think that they have a right to tell people who they should be allowed to marry . Just because something happens all the time does not mean it is not cruel and unjust . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>First of all it is not against " someone else's beliefs " in that incredibly simplistic way . It is against the beliefs of society since the year dot , religious beliefs or ' ikk ' factor whatever that is are irrelevant even if they contribute to some people's attitudes . Second yes I would probably feel sad if I wasn't allowed to marry the person I was with BUT I would be with the person I love in any event . Thirdly , as marriage is looked on as a public institution then Society as a whole is entitled to lay down the rules relating to it just as Society lays down the rules and laws by which we live . Cruelty and injustice occur when you are stopped from doing something you are entitled to do . Gay marriage at present is not something you are entitled to it would seem . Have to say in the UK we have made some steps towards that .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I really think you can not put yourself in someone elses place . So you believe that " Cruelty and injustice occur when you are stopped from doing something you are entitled to do . " ? Is this correct ? So if I use your belief on another topic , say slavery , you then would conclude that slavery was neither cruel nore injust 1 since it was a legal and traditional activity practiced since OG was in the cave 2 slaves should not think it was cruel and unjust because they had no legal rights and standing and thus was not cruel and unjust since they were slaves . My point is just because something is the law or not the law does not make it any less cruel or unjust when viewed from a certain perspective . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Firstly I am not even going to put slavery on the same level as gay marriage . I frankly do not believe that the alleged suffering gays not being allowed to marry comes in any way close to the suffering of slaves . Secondly you are of course perfectly correct about cruelty and injustice ( neither or certainly the first one do I think apply to gay marriage ) and the way forward was to lobby etc as Wilberforce did to abolish slave trade . We can only advance in civilisation ( I hope ) but lobbying publicity etc can help people's awareness in bring matters before their eyes to decide on . There will always be minorities of dissenters ( strange world if none ) but in the last analysis Society determines how it is run . You talk about the tyranny of the majority but of course the reverse can also be true .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I am not comparing the two . I am using your own beliefs and statements and appling them to slavery .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Maybe that's because my family represents the norm , not a deviation from the norm .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yeah , diversity sure sucks , doesn't it ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yep , perversity sure does . ;)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>What is perverse in your view ? That which isn't the norm , that which is diverse ? It's a very long list , so I doubt you believe this . You hate a particular form of diversity : gays . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You assume too much . As I've pointed out before , I don't hate gays , I just don't believe that we should redefine marriage for them . Period .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You call me or a family I may have , a perversion ( sorry the word was " perversity " ) , but that is not hate ? I believe I am probably younger than you , but that doesn't mean I was born yesterday . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You can believe what you want , no matter how wrong you are .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Fine , I'll stand by the exact wording of my original post . Who do you think made AIDS a major health concern in the US ? If you have anything via proof that it's not true , bring it on . I welcome the debate . So far , all I've seen is attempts to change the debate , attack me personally or make unsubstantiated statements that don't mean #### .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Okay , you'll get an answer to this question . First off , no one knows how AIDS actually got to the US . Secondly , as to who made AIDS a major health concern , they would be people who didn't clean their needles and such while doing drugs , and people who did not practice safe sex , as well those giving blood transfusions before it was known that HIV / AIDS could be spread through blood . No more , no less . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Do you have something of substance to back your claim or are you going to stick with your opinion only ?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well for that , we'll have to quote one of your recent posts : <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I'm still waiting for anything of content to stream from your keyboard . I guess I'll just grow old waiting for a pearl of wisdom to flow from your fingers .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Here you go : <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So the best you can do for an intelligent statement is quote me ? I'm flattered . Now , when do you want the debate to start or are you still afraid ?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>The debate will start once you personally own up to your own requirements of others . Until then , I will continue to note the hypocrisy in you expecting others to defend something when you yourself are unwilling to do the same with your statement . Once you follow your " bizarro " rules ( as Kronus so eloquently put it :) ) , then you will get a debate . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Irf you accept my challenge , I guarantee you that I'll prove my assertion in the debate . Is that good enough for you ?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The cultural meaning of marriage is a formalization of a mating pair , who , in turn , create and support a family unit . Love and reproduction are implied . The legal meaning of marriage is , in most States , a contract between two people who are not under the age of consent , of different genders , of the same species , not closely related and who are not already married . Homosexuals are not a part of the traditional or cultural meaning of marriage . In order to be included , the meaning of marriage would have to change . The catch-22 is that homosexual couples want to be included in the current meaning of marriage , but what gives marriage meaning specifically excludes homosexual couples .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That's your definition . It is certainly not my definition . You don't speak for all of society . I personally define marriage as a union of two people who love one another and wish to make a commitment to one another . If marriage is about reproduction , why does nobody bat an eye when a 65 year old woman marries a 68 year old man ? If you believe marriage is " formalization of a mating pair " , and " reproduction is implied " , doesn't this cheapen the institution of marriage in your eyes ? Obviously , they are not getting married to start a family ... perhaps love is what is important ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Mating pairs exist with or without marriage , and have no legal connection with marriage ( since , legally , it doesn't matter if the two people even like one another , or ever intend on consumating said marriage ) . The only connection between a mating couple and marriage is the connection made on a cultural level . So , logically , the cultural meaning of marriage would be the purpose of a mating couple . While ' purpose ' can mean different things , in this context I daresay most would refer to the evolutionary purpose of a mating couple : reproduction . Love is implied because love brings the couple together for that purpose . While legally a 27 yr old marrying a 70 yr old sugar daddy is not a problem , culturally speaking this marriage is not as meaningful as one that is in-line with the evolutionary purpose I outlined above . You can point to exceptions all you want , but all it does is outline the difference between the legal meaning and the cultural meaning of marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Who gave you the power to decide what is culturally meaningful ? And more importantly , should we legally define marriage based on your perception of " cultural meaning " ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No , you should legally define it any damn way you can get away with . The cultural definition comes from observation .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But who get's to decide that legal definition ... that's the point . In this specific case in point , the anti crowd wishes to limit the rights of others simply based on personally held beliefs ... when no harm is presented to any party involved . In a case such as this , I feel strongly that without a specific vector of harm , we must as a civilized society rule in favor of providing equal rights rather than limit rights of a minority . I think these 4 pages thus far make clear that cultural definition is based on subjective obeservation and personal opinion formed via that observation . Clearly , I and many others here do not share your cultural definition . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>In America the people generally vote on issues , or elect representatives to enact laws . That's how you change the legal definitions . This isn't about equality , snakespit . The title of this thread shows that :P In all seriousness , though , it really isn't about equality . I don't think you have a rational basis upon which to dispute that observation . It is an indisputible fact that the cultural view that has dominated this country ( as evidenced by the definition of marriage ) generally follows evolutionarily sound logic : monogamous pair bonding outside of close familial ties . Inclusion of homosexuals would obviously change that .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I'm speaking of everyone who lives in the society ... it's implicit that we agree to live by the laws of that society :P A social contract , if you will . That's why we're punished for breaking those laws . Change them , sure ... break them , no . Well , I certainly disagree with your point of view ... what have I said that points to religion ? If the meaning were solely based upon religion then it would be an arbitrary custom . But it's based upon biology , which isn't an arbitrary difference .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>As long as 70 year olds are allowed to marry then you have lost that arguement . What is the difference between a couple of 70 year olds and a gay couple ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>A heterosexual bond's ultimate causation is to facilitate reproduction . Pointing out a particular couple who does not reproduce would not change that fact :P Marriage is a formalization of that bond . Rofl , you would still have a problem with that , don't lie . After all , OMG THEY HAVE BENEFITS YOU DON'T GET OMG . And that's unconstitutional isn't it , Matthew S. At least according to your flawed reasoning .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I want equality . The lack of is what I find unconstitutional and unjust . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Surely , and in your little scenario married people still have benefits that you don't get . So it's a lie that you'd ' be ok with that ' since you've been pretty loudly outspoken about that very point . That if anyone has benefits you don't get then it must be unconstitutional .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I have had this idea for years . http://www.4forums.com/political/gay...man-woman.html <br><b>S1:4-  </b>lol , so what ? You've also been braying about how if some people have benefits that you don't have access to ( and in your scenario it would be much less possible for you to get those benefits ) then it must be unconstitutional . So either you're a hypocrite or you don't actually pay attention to what you say .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I actually have a marriage license . The same license that everyone gets from the state of Iowa , yet my license is not recognized by either the federal government or the state of Michigan , how is that not unconstitutional ? Why are those the only two options ? I want equality and I don't care how it comes about . If my rules where applied to marriage , yes it would suck , but I would then be treated equally to those heteros , who currently do not breed , can not breed , or choose not to breed , yet can get a marriage license at the drop of a hat and have it recognized . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Because the Constitution does not require them to :P It has been long established that States have authority over marriage definitions . Because , gasp , they get marriage benefits while you do not ! Are you saying it's equal for some people to get marriage benefits but single people do not ?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>What is it about the same piece of paper you do not understand ? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>The reason you have that paper is the same reason other States don't have to honor it . That reason is : States decide for themselves what constitutes a marriage . I'm still interested in the fact that you're ok with some people getting marriage benefits and others not getting them .<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Once again the state of Iowa issues one piece of paper to everyone . What part of that do you not understand ? The other states and the federal government must recognize all or none . If marriage is to be about breeders and breeding children , and my rules are adopted by the state then yes I am alright . If my rules were adopted then almost no one would get married , and those who get married have to breed if they don't they are no longer married . They have to have 3 witnesses to their act of breeding , along with a video of the event stored in the public records of the county were they live . <br><b>S1:7-  </b>I understand every part of that . Nothing makes States recognize all or none , Matthew S. In fact , it's been true since the ratification that States establish their own marriage laws ... and anyone in the State is subject to those marriage laws . It doesn't matter what other States say about your marriage because you're not in those States . No you aren't because some people would have marriage benefits but you will not . You've been very vocal that if anyone gets marriage benefits when you do not then it must be unconstitutional . Are you now saying that it's perfectly Constitutional for only some people to get marriage benefits ? And you're wrong , of course . People would get married . Besides ' having witnesses ' ( which is for the signing of the contract not the execution , duh ) , a lifelong relationship with children is the ideal marriage . It's what people hope to have .<br><b> S2:7-  </b>And why would gay people be any different ? What we have is you saying to me that I can't get married because you have some belief against it . I wish I could say to you , you can't go to that place or do that thing because I have a belief against you doing so . <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Saying heterosexuals are the same as homosexuals is political fiction . At some point you'll have to realize that biological differences exist and sometimes that has ramifications for how you're treated . It's a bit like being left-handed ; the world is sort of built around people being rightys . Sorry . You're sitting there demanding the world be changed to suit leftys as if it is your due , while at the same time casually denying that anything was made for rightys in the first place . It's insulting , ignorant and arrogant . I'd oppose you for those reasons alone :P You can . You really can . All you need is for a lot of people to agree with you .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Healthcare usually applies to spouses . Therefore , if it is illegal for gays to marry in VA , he gets no healthcare . It's a fairly simple law to understand . It works the same way with a straight guy who has a girlfriend ... she doesn't get healthcare provided by his job . I hope the gays who are upset with VA leave . It will cause less havoc in the state .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Which part about not allowing them to become spouses don't you get ? The straight guy can marry his girlfriend so she gets the benefits . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>And the point is , in VA gays can't get married , therefore they can't share their gay lover's healthcare . Simple as that . Hopefully gay marriages will be outlawed everywhere so we don't have to continue to hear them bitch and moan about healthcare . If a man has a girlfriend , do you believe she is entitled to get healthcare from his job ?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Actually if they cohabitate for a prescribed period of time or have children together I would say yes . Commonlaw as it were . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Common law is 2 words buddy .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Or hyphenated . Thank you . I stand corrected .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>So , then 2 gays people living together in VA shouldn't expect healthcare , since a couple who isn't married doesn't get it .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>" thats just the way it is " isn't much of an argument ! So , basically you don't care that some people can have rights , while others who should have them don't get them . So , I take it you liked segregation , prohabition and prefer women barefoot in the kitchen rather than at the polls voting for anything . Wow ! all I an say is wow . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I'm guessing you mean " prohibition " . Gays don't have the right to shared healthcare because they're not married ! Gays have rights ... they can marry members of the opposite sex . Nobody can marry members of the opposite sex , it's not just gays . Gays have all the rights that straight people do . Straights can't marry people of the same sex , and neither can gays . If straigh people want heatlcare , they can marry someone of the opposite sex ... so can gays !<br><b> S2:2-  </b>We don't have the right to marry who we love and if ya didn't notice it isn't someone of the same sex . What a ridculous posts ! We are fighting to the right to marry , we will win , we will have healthcare and we are in your neighborhood too ! Trust me , we are nor backing down to the xtian right wing . We shall overcome ! <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Haha !! It seems like " you all " are going in the wrong direction then . Thousands of gays in San Francisco recently had their marriages enulled . A judge in Seattle was also told he can't allow gays to get married . Missouri just voted to outlaw gay marriage ( 70% of the people voted to ban it ... pretty alarming if you ask me ) . How do you figure you are in the process to " overcome " ? It looks quite the opposite if you ask me . The only luck you have is moving to another country or moving to Massachusetts . Mark my word , there will never be a federal law allowing gay marriages in the US .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>That's just what they said about slavery , women voting , interacial marriage . It is what they said about people flying , looking for a cure to polio , It is always darkest before the dawn ! <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Looking at slavery is incorrect . Slavery was wrong because certain individuals who couldn't change their color were targeted and often tortured . They were treated as property and had no rights . HOWEVER , gays have the exact same rights as heterosexuals and are not property , nor can they be targeted by color , etc. Women voting is also a terrible example . That has to do with free speech , which is an unalienable right ( last time I checked , gays being allowed to marry wasn't an unalienable right ) . That was also when women couldn't hold jobs and had to work in the home . Gays don't have to do that . Interracial marriage goes along with slavery and is an absolutely terrible example . It was looked down upon , not illegal . Thomas Jefferson had children by a black woman .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Yes it does , because what is happening here is that ' family ' and ' marriage ' are being redefined . It is being broadened . People like Colson believe that marriage and family fits a certain criteria for it to truly be a marriage . That criteria IS traditional marriage , and if that changes that in Colson's eyes traditional marriage IS affected . I don't see how you can say that adopting gay marriage has no effect on that . I've heard Colson speak , BTW ; he speaks all over the country . I agree with some of what he's said and some I don't . He would say the same thing about kids raised in single parent homes ; but it's not that he's saying single parent homes are bad ; he's saying that homes with a mother and father are the best scenario . I think that's what he's saying here too . He's basically saying that by his observations of prisons , that traditional families do best in terms of raising children and them staying out of prison . Whether he's right or not is another matter , but I think it's important to at least represent the man's statements correctly here .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>He's done pretty well for a felon . Yet no constitutional amendment banning single-parenthood . How odd ... I wonder how long it will be before folks like Colson and you stop drawing conclusions about same-sex couples from your observations of single-parenthood . Never , I suppose . sigh <br><b>S1:2-  </b>How do you know he wouldn't support one if it were up for a vote ? I wonder how long it will be before folks like you stop claiming things that aren't happening ? I don't draw such conclusions . Sorry . . . accidentally misworded that . No " game " intended at all . I had no idea you've never had a typing mistake in your life .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That was a particularly bad volley . ( see below ) No , you just find them " compelling " . The game I'm talking about has nothing to do with that omission . The game , as you well know , is to engage in disagreement on every possible point . It's right there in your job description . Page 3 , paragraph 2 and 5 . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Look , there's really no need to be hostile here . With all due respect , I do agree on the record here sometimes with people who support gay rights . For instance , I've said I agree the amendment is a bad thing . I've said on numerous occassions that I agree that gays experience violence and harassment and measures must be taken to change that . I've agreed with the gay rights stance on gay adoption . I've agreed that gays shouldn't have to face job and housing discrimination . I've agreed on numerous things . Those aren't instances of disagreement , but of agreement . Maybe I just haven't often found your comments agreeable .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes , I know . You may remember that I pointed out your opposition to the amendment to another poster just the other day . It's precisely the discrepancy between your stated beliefs and your constant arguments in opposition to them that lead people to believe that you do not , in fact , support gay rights . There are other possibilities , of course . Personally , I've latched onto the idea that you're paid to be here . I realize it's a bit silly , but , frankly , it's the least morally repugnant one I can come up with , and I hate to think ill of people I don't know . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>What evv . I've latched onto the idea that you're main reason for being here is to post beligerantly about and to posters you disagree with about THEM rather than the topics at hand .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Sometimes it's hard to tell if people are going ghetto or going gay . Can you describe the hand gestures that went with that ?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Actually , I think it's probably the most compelling argument I've read for the amendment . The be fair , I don't think the author is claiming there is a direct link between gay marriage and crime . He seems to be talking about overall effect on society and traditional family . But I'm still against the amendment ; amending the constitution over something like this is just not the right thing to do .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>" compelling argument " ? So do you believe the basis of what he's claiming ? And are you ready to debate it ? Because there is no " overall effect on society and traditional family " from gay marriage . The " traditional family " has been having its OWN problems , and has been in decline in these countries LONG BEFORE gay marriage ever was legalized . It's like a guy jumping out of an airplane , and he starts falling to the ground . Three seconds later gay marriage is legalized , and conservatives want to blame the fact that he's falling on gay marriage ... It makes no sense . There is no causality here ... Do straight people say , " Hey ! Gay marriage is legal . I don't want to get married now . " Do straight people say , " Hey ! Gay marriage is legal . I want to get a divorce now . " The " most compelling argument " lacks any semblance of sense . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes it does , because what is happening here is that ' family ' and ' marriage ' are being redefined . It is being broadened . People like Colson believe that marriage and family fits a certain criteria for it to truly be a marriage . That criteria IS traditional marriage , and if that changes that in Colson's eyes traditional marriage IS affected . I don't see how you can say that adopting gay marriage has no effect on that . I've heard Colson speak , BTW ; he speaks all over the country . I agree with some of what he's said and some I don't . He would say the same thing about kids raised in single parent homes ; but it's not that he's saying single parent homes are bad ; he's saying that homes with a mother and father are the best scenario . I think that's what he's saying here too . He's basically saying that by his observations of prisons , that traditional families do best in terms of raising children and them staying out of prison . Whether he's right or not is another matter , but I think it's important to at least represent the man's statements correctly here .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>LOL ! I don't see how you can say that it DOES have an effect on that . Tell me , for starters , WHAT effect it will happen . Will Colson get a divorce if gay marriage is legalized ? Will Colson wish he had never gotten married if gay marriage is legalized ? THEY are claiming SPECIFIC effects . NEGATIVE effects . Effects that should be PROVEN for them to be claimed ... HOW can they claim those SPECIFIC DETRIMENTAL effects from gay marriage onto OTHER PEOPLE's marriages ??? Where's the proof ? 1 ) Studies DO back-up the issue of " single vs dual parent house-holds " . And that is common sense . Two heads are better than one . Twice the capability to care . 2 ) Studies REFUTE the claims that dual heterosexual parents are better than dual gay parents . They aren't . Gay parents are just as good . The gender of the parents are irrelevant . The sexual orientation of the parents is irrelevant . Where did I misrepresent something Jyoshu ? He's claiming a SPECIFIC DETRIMENTAL EFFECT on families due to gay marriage . THAT is what I'm talking about . THAT is what I want proven , if he's going to claim it . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Easy . . . marriage in the defined sense will be changed . It will be more broadened . Where did he claim that ? All I see is that he feels that traditional families are better in terms of kids from them staying out of prison . It seemed to me you were representing this as someone ' blaming ' gay marriage for crime . If that's not what you meant , then fair enough .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Is that ALL the effect you are claiming then ? Are you then contradicting the previous article's claim that it will have a negative effect on heterosexual marriages ? Did you read the article Jyoshu ? Do you even know what we're talking about ? Again , did you READ the article Jyoshu ? Because if not , then why did you claim : " Actually , I think it's probably the most compelling argument I've read for the amendment . " For Jyoshu's edification : If you don't comprehend that is PRECISELY what the author IS doing , then I don't know what to tell you . It's there in black and white ! <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I never said I was compelled , or convinced by the article . I said it was probably the most compelling that I've seen . I see nothing in that quote blaming gay marriage for crime , directy OR even indirectly . You are making an inference --o ne that may or may NOT be intended . I would think if Colson's point was to lay blame for crime he would have simply said so . He didn't . Colson is simply opposing thge amendment because he believes that traditional families are best in terms of avoiding crime . I don't really agree either -- I think there are too many variables for that to automatically be the case .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Oh . I see . So if somebody said " Christianity causes cancer " , that would be a compelling argument for people to not be Christians . Right ? Give me a freakin ' break Jyoshu . READ the article . It's talking about gay marriage and the effects of it on society . It makes claims that : 1 ) Gay marriage will cause detriment to straight marriages . 2 ) Detriment to straight marriages , e.g. single parent families , yield greater instances of criminals . It's all right there . In plain English . I am making no " inference " . This IS what the author is saying . Then explain to me his next paragraph where he links LEGALIZATION of gay marriage to a decrease in " traditional families " . Can't you put two and two together ? And Colson is not " opposing " the amendment . He's SUPPORTING it . From the article : " This is just one reason that I am so passionately in favor of the Marriage Protection Amendment ... " Can't you even get THAT right ? Or are you so lost in obfuscation that you've confused yourself ?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Bert and Ernie are not gay !! Its all in your little heads . Gay men like you cannot seem to understand that two men can be close and not want to fondle each others genitals . Why cant Miss piggy and Kermit be the flag carriers for mixed species sex if Bert and Ernie are chosen by gay men to be homosexual icons .. against the wishes of the creators . You want to inject deviant sex into childrens programmes then cry when you are compared with other sexual deviants . Fair makes me<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The show is a work of fiction , of course it's all in people's heads ! Did I say I believe they are gay ? No , I didn't . Once again , making assumptions . Look in the mirror if you want to see someone who lives in his own head . Oh yeah , you think you know what I'm thinking every second . Someone's got a dirty mind too . Others were just talking about marriage , not sex acts . You should look back and see what I said about false dilemma fallacies . It's in bold a few posts back . I guess Kermit and Miss Piggy already are interspecies , between pig and frog . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You would want them to be considered gay though wouldnt you ? You seem to be one of a group of homosexauals that want childrens characters to be sexualised though ... if you do not then why arent you saying it ? If it quacks and waddles then its probably a duck . I would to know what a person who wants to sexualise Sesame street characters thinks for one second , let alone every second . This is what makes me so sick about your hypocrisy . You seperate the sex from marriage just when it suits you . You want two male characters to be homosexual and take out the homosexual sex element just when it suits you . But two men could live together and be extremely close without being homosexual .. the homosexual element comes in at the genital fondling stage . You know it but cry ' dirty minds ' when this is stated . Pathetic and Miss piggy and kermit are interspecies but not portrayed as sexually active but gays like you want us to believe bert and ernie are .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No . You can portray some of the straight human characters as being married , without it being anything close to an adult sex film . In this case , some are just saying they would like two charcters who are both male to be married . Straight or gay can discuss the fact of marriage , without getting into sex act details or even touching the topic of sex acts . I believe that , and if you don't when it comes to gays , it is indeed you who has the dirty mind where the topic at hand is concerned . Who else has mentioned sex acts ? No one . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Well once we you have same sex marriages then you may have straight men marrying . There may be advantages in this for some straight men . However it seems that the people who wish to see Ernie and Bert get married are men who have sex with each other . You and other gays want Bert and Ernie to be seen as gay men ie men who are sexually attracted to other men . You are all the more sickenly dishonest by pretending otherwise . One does not need to actually show or discuss the sexual acts of people when describing their sexuality ... you are the one that is stupidly suggesting this . However the fact remains that people do have sex and gays have a deviant form of it . There is no evidence that Bert and Ernie have deviant sex but you want them to be described as such but under the guise of ' married ' .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Straight men can already get married to women , so what the hell would be the point of marrying a man if it's not your orientation and you can have everything in marriage anyway ?! No , not necessarily . It can be celibate gay men or straight people who support gay inclusion and think this is the correct way to accomplish it . You can de-emphasize the sexual part , because you are dealing with children , the same way you do from different sex marriages . Nope . You stupidly said it when you suggested Bert and Ernie playing with their genitals . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So you are saying only gays can have same sex marriages ? Why ? Two men could have a sexless marriage . maybe even have girlfriends . Would you discriminate against this lifestyle ? But they would still want to have sex with other men though wouldnt they ? You want Bert and Ernie to WANT to have sex with other men ie homosexual . Wht cant they just be friends ? Straight De emphasise the fact that the people who want them to be married are homosexuals more Straight Thats what homosexuals do isnt it ?
