He says that gay marriage is a deviation from the traditional union between a man and woman. Any sexual relationship that is a deviation from the "norm," like polygamist and incestuous relationships, should also be granted the same rights. The speaker feels that these relationships are all on the same levels, and one should not be afforded rights that the others are not.

S2 identifies as a gay male, who has been in a 15-year-long homosexual relationship, and has a set of twins due soon; he feels his family should be granted the same rights as a heterosexual, married couple. He states that legalizing gay marriage allows for automatic guardianship of children if something happens to the biological parent, and also awards survivors benefits from social security. He believes that other types of marriage should be looked at based on its own situations and conditions.<br><b> key:   </b>1-3089_96_94__97_99_103_105_108_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>As I already stated Kerry expected to carry Ohio and got smashed there ........ Ohio passed a Gay marriage amendment and the silent majority spoke there as they did through out the U.S. re electing President Bush by 3 million a bigger margin then " Slick Willie " ever got .........<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This statement seems incorrect in too many ways for me to let it stand . First , to assume that the majority of people in Ohio were either silent about their views on same-sex marriage or on their choice for president is utter nonsense . They were absolutely as loud-mouthed about it as anyone else . Your implications that there is some " silent majority " imply a misunderstanding of the political battlefield , and I hope I have been able to clear it up . Next , although Bush won by a larger margin than Bill Clinton ( who you term " slick Willie " for no other reason than to anger and insult his supporters , I assume ? ) , this does not mean that Clinton did not win by a larger percentage . Remember that population increases over time , and there was a slightly higher voter turnout in this election due to its controversy . Even though Bush by a large number of voters compared to previous elections , he won by a marginal percentage due to the fact that the population of the US has increased . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Actually the population growth has nothing to do with the margin of victory ... I am talking about the votes President Bush won by and " Slick Willie " did not even get a 50 percent majority in either the 1992 and the 1996 election ......... He was very lucky that Perot ran in 1992 otherwise Bush would have defeated him ....... I am sure you have heard the term silent majority before ......... These are the people that when they vote make all the polls that the left wing media put out like the presidents approval rating is down or how bad the economy is or how bad the war in Iraq is going .......... If you think that morals and the gay marriage issue had no bearing in the president winning Ohio then you are living in a state of denial my friend ........<br><b> S2:2-  </b>In 2000 , Gore had 48.4% of the popular vote , while Bush had 47.9% . That gives Bush a negative . 5% in popular vote . In 2004 , Bush had 51% of the popular vote while Kerry had 48.1% . That gives Bush a victory by 2.9% of the popular vote . In comparison , Clinton in 1992 had 43% of the vote while Bush Sr. had 37.4% of the vote , which gives Clinton a win by 5.6% . In 1996 , Dole had 40.7% of the vote while Clinton had 49.2% of the vote , which gives Clinton the win by 8.5% . Clinton clearly had far greater victories than Bush ever did , the difference was that there was a competent third candidate running in both of Clinton's wins . http://mediamatters.org/items/200411150007 I have heard the term silent majority in the past , but it cannot refer to a majority which was not silent . The majority in Ohio ( and all of those other 11 states ) was in fact very , very vocal . Every poll was accurate . The term " silent majority " is not appropriate . I have no doubt that majority's desire to oppress the minority did play some factor in Bush's win in Ohio , but statistics suggest that it was a very small part . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Just for your information getting a majority of the vote means over 50 percent ........ Why was Kerry so sure he was going to win Ohio ? It is becasue the silent majority stood up big time ...........<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I did not say that this is not what the majority means . I was addressing the implications of your post , which is that Bush was more supported than Clinton . That is untrue . And why was Bush so sure he was going to win Michigan ? Actually Bush wasn't so sure he was going to win Michigan , and Kerry wasn't so sure he was going to win Ohio . Asking why Kerry was so sure he was going to win Ohio assumes the false premise that Kerry was so sure he was going to win it . In fact , he was not . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>President Bush did not win Michigan in 2000 and it would have been and upset if he won it 2004 but in every state that he lost in 2000 he picked up a bigger percent of the vote in 2004 ........ And amazing statitistic ..........<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>178<br>S1 feels that the silent majority in Ohio spoke out about the issue of the state's passing of a gay rights amendment, and compares it to the large percentage of voters in past presidential elections. He believes that the morals and beliefs in the state were the reasons for the Republican presidential candidate, George Bush, winning by a larger percentage than either democratic candidate, John Kerry and Bill Clinton, in the past elections. 

S2 rebuts that the majority of people in Ohio were not silent about their views on gay marriage or on their choice for president; the people in that state were very vocal about their views. He states that Bush did win by a larger percentage than Clinton, the increase in population was the determining factor for those numbers. He feels that majority's desire to oppress the minority, in Ohio, did play some factor in Bush's win. He uses percentages from various candidates, likeClinton, Bush, Dole, Kerry and Gore to back up his argument. He disagrees that Bush was more supported than Clinton.<br><b> key:   </b>1-6646_6_5__7_10_11_12_17_20_3 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Indeed protesting made a difference , but it didn't happen until enough people came on board . All the protesting in the world wouldn't have brought it about if the will of the people were not changing to make it happen . At the end of the day , any legislative movement needs the will of the people to be successful . It may not need a full majority in some cases , but it needs enough people on board . That's why legislation requires not only voting ( by legislature ) , but elected officials to do so as well . There was a process our country went through on those issues as whether or not they were legitimate in terms of the law -- it involved a national debate , protests , etc. Sometimes this process results in our country ( the people ) granting civil rights legislation , and sometimes it doesn't ( depending on whether it is deemed warranted ) . The process ( which will undoubtedly take years ) is going on right now in regards to gays . Time will tell what the result will be . Any form of legislation is a voting matter . That's the way our system works .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why is it that whenever this comes up you insist on conflating " the people voting on a law " with " the legislature voting on a law " or " the people electing politicians " ? Why can't you simply discuss the topic at hand ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>In what way do you feel it is not the issue at hand ? Matthew asked about voting on his civil rights and this is all part of the voting process .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>In exactly the way I just said . He asked about people voting on laws , not legislators voting on laws . Again , why can't you answer that question ; why do you feel that it's necessary to move the topic around ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Fair enough ; but regardless , the point still stands -- people voting on laws is indeed allowed under our system . ( Ballot initiatives . ) It is all part of the process I mentioned to Matthew of society determining its standards . If you have a beef with the people being able to work toward determining our society's standards ( through voting on such issues ) , then if I were you I'd take it up with the govt .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Or we could take it up here , like Matthew did , and discuss it . Or at least try to , and hope someone doesn't derail the conversation into irrelevant issues like how the legislature works . I will echo the point that several have made here . The idea of allowing the masses to determine civil rights is stupid and wrong . If a group's civil rights need protecting , then they need protecting from the very masses that are doing the voting . Ballot measures may be a legal process , but that doesn't prevent them from being stupid and wrong , now does it ? That's the point that's trying to be made here . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well , that's up to you . If you don't want to derail it , you don't have to . It seems to me that what is really happening in society with these ballot initiatives and other parts of the process is determining whether or not it is a civil right in the first place to give legal marriage to whatever group arrangement is in question . ( In this case , gays couples . ) That process has to take place ; it is just not feasible in our society to give marriage equality to any group of any arrangement that comes along demanding it until we determine for certain that it needs to be done . If society determines that same-sex arrangements of two people should suffice to redefine marriage for it to be included , then so be it . But that process has to be there in some form , realistically . If you are going to draw the line in terms of what can be voted on a ballot initiative or not , what authority determines that ? How are you going to determine where that line is drawn ? And you can't just arbitrarily say " when civil rights are being infringed " because that doesn't carry any legal weight -- it's opinion . Just saying it's " stupid " and " wrong " may be your point being made , but it's a point that doesn't offer any solutions .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You really are a piece of work . All you're saying here is that if society wants to be bigoted it should be allowed to be . Very libertarian of you , but I believe that if the power of the government can be used to fight evil and prejudice , it should . If wrong is happening , and the government can stop it , it should . You will of course claim that the government can't do anything , but history has proven that position wrong . The government has taken stands against biggotry before , and while it hasn't eradicated it , it has improved things . Gee , now I'm supposed to offer solutions before you even get what the point is ? I'm I allowed to use both hands while I type ? Any other restrictions you want to add ?<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>179<br>S1 feels that issues involving legislative movements are decided by society. Though the legislature votes on national issues, the power of the citizens is what grants or denies civil rights legislation. He feels the hot issue right now involves gay marriage, and the outcome of that issue will be a voting matter. According to him, society determines its own standards and it is not possible to make gay marriage civil rights matter. Legal marriage cannot just be handed out to any group that calls for it; society determines the facts and acts reasonably and accordingly to the facts given about the issue.

S2 feels that civil rights issues should not be left up to society, especially if that society is the main deterrent in approving a group's rights.  He states that the government should be the force behind protecting citizens' rights against the hatred and bigotry of the masses. The government has involved itself in civil rights issues in the past, and should step up to defend gay rights when it comes to legal marriage.</p><br><br><b>worker_id </b>A1YWSCZ3GENEQB<br>HITid:</b>  3Z3R5YC0P3N3RJ7OKJQT13Z4S9SFTX<br> <b>Status:</b>Rejected<br><b> key:   </b>1-10073_119_44__120_124_127_129_130_131_132_133_134_6 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>I really wish that you would read my posts before commenting .

Again , why can't you answer that question ; why do you feel that it's necessary to move the topic around ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Fair enough ; but regardless , the point still stands -- people voting on laws is indeed allowed under our system . ( Ballot initiatives . ) It is all part of the process I mentioned to Matthew of society determining its standards . If you have a beef with the people being able to work toward determining our society's standards ( through voting on such issues ) , then if I were you I'd take it up with the govt .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Or we could take it up here , like Matthew did , and discuss it . Or at least try to , and hope someone doesn't derail the conversation into irrelevant issues like how the legislature works . I will echo the point that several have made here . The idea of allowing the masses to determine civil rights is stupid and wrong . If a group's civil rights need protecting , then they need protecting from the very masses that are doing the voting . Ballot measures may be a legal process , but that doesn't prevent them from being stupid and wrong , now does it ? That's the point that's trying to be made here . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well , that's up to you . If you don't want to derail it , you don't have to . It seems to me that what is really happening in society with these ballot initiatives and other parts of the process is determining whether or not it is a civil right in the first place to give legal marriage to whatever group arrangement is in question . ( In this case , gays couples . ) That process has to take place ; it is just not feasible in our society to give marriage equality to any group of any arrangement that comes along demanding it until we determine for certain that it needs to be done . If society determines that same-sex arrangements of two people should suffice to redefine marriage for it to be included , then so be it . But that process has to be there in some form , realistically . If you are going to draw the line in terms of what can be voted on a ballot initiative or not , what authority determines that ? How are you going to determine where that line is drawn ? And you can't just arbitrarily say " when civil rights are being infringed " because that doesn't carry any legal weight -- it's opinion . Just saying it's " stupid " and " wrong " may be your point being made , but it's a point that doesn't offer any solutions .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You really are a piece of work . All you're saying here is that if society wants to be bigoted it should be allowed to be . Very libertarian of you , but I believe that if the power of the government can be used to fight evil and prejudice , it should . If wrong is happening , and the government can stop it , it should . You will of course claim that the government can't do anything , but history has proven that position wrong . The government has taken stands against biggotry before , and while it hasn't eradicated it , it has improved things . Gee , now I'm supposed to offer solutions before you even get what the point is ? I'm I allowed to use both hands while I type ? Any other restrictions you want to add ?<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>166<br>S1 states that any form of legislation is a voting matter and that in order for a legislative movement to be successful it must have the support of the people or voters as well as elected officials. He believes that, in the case of gay couples, the legislative process is working to determine whether or not civil rights are being infringed upon before deciding a course of action and that you cannot disallow the process for civil rights issues simply because potential voters may or may not agree that a civil rights infringement has occurred. 
S2 believes that civil rights issues should not be voted upon by the masses, if a group believes their civil rights are in need of protection it should not be up to the masses who are seemingly denying them to make the decisions. He states that the government has taken stands against bigotry in the past and although they were not able to eradicate it, the situations were improved.</p><br><br><b>worker_id </b>A3RRSDNNBE0VVI<br>HITid:</b>  3PUV2Q8SV446XDZBTR4ID9QXAPCDBU<br> <b>Status:</b>Approved<br><b> key:   </b>1-9391_147_145_1_157_162_165_170_187_191_196_197_13 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>And rimming some dude's hairy bung is soooo appealing by comparison ?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What DVDs have you been watching , JP ?

He uses certain sexual practices common in the gay community as evidence. Further, S1 argues that supporting gay rights shows the lack of moral character of supporters. S2 retorts that in fact opposing gay rights shows a lack of moral character and accuses S1 of in fact being in denial of his own homosexuality. He bases this accusation on S1's knowledge of aforementioned sexual practices and familiarity with gay cultural practices.  S1 argues that barring same sex marriage is an exercise of constitutional rights and that he has been happily committed to a heterosexual marriage for many years.  S2 argues that gay marriage was denied to married, loving gay couples and that being married to a woman is no indicator of one's true sexual preference. S2 argues that S1's familiarity with gay practices points to him possibly being in denial or hiding his true sexual preference.  S1's repeated mocking of S2, according to S2 does little to hide the evidence of S1's true nature or sexual preference.<br><b> key:   </b>1-2280_102_99__104_113_117_118_120_121_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Although Jim and MrWrite's debate has devolved into an unfortunate battle of screw you's , the comparison of the arguments against interacial marriage and those against gay marriage has some merit . At least that's what this article suggests : Opponents of gay marriage use many of the same arguments as foes of interracial relationships did before Loving v . Virginia outlawed state bans on interracial marriage in 1967 , said law professor Kim Forde-Mazrui at a talk sponsored by the Center for the Study of Race and Law and Lambda Law Alliance Sept . 30 . http://www.law.virginia.edu/home2002...fall/forde.htm<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This is not relevant to my argument at all . I have mentioned nothing about religious beliefs or bible-thumping protests against homosexuality . I did not bring interacial marriage into the discussion because it does not apply . I'm not against interacial marriage as long as there's a man and a woman involved . I did not bring the silly argument about water fountains into the discussion . Separate-but-equal does apply in the sense that records of legally recognized couples would separate married couples from same-sex couples but would not justify any inequalities regarding their rights and privileges . Hospital visitation , inheritance and other things could be afforded both . I'm wondering if those who insist on same-sex couples being called " married " are not acting somewhat from self-imposed shame ... like you want to hide the fact that you are gay . My argument has thusfar been limited to the requirement to redefine several other words if we redefine " marriage " . It has nothing to do with homophobia which , by the way , I do not suffer from . I have some friends that are gay and they know how I feel about the word " marriage " . We remain friends . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I accept your argument at face value , although I will say that I believe that the majority of people who argue against gay marriage do so for religious or homophobe reasons . ( Again , I'm not saying you fall into these categories . ) Words get redefined all the time , and some of them are just as important as the word ' marriage ' . For example , the Iraq War is not technically a war -- congress never declared war . And this isn't just a semantic detail , either . Declaring war used to mean that congress committed , the president committed , and all the citizens made sacrifices for the cause . Now we initiate military operations , never declare war in order to allow political wiggle room , cut everyone's taxes , tell them to go shopping , and call it a war anyway . Now that's redefining a word . Substituting a Jack for a Jill on a marriage license seems pretty minor in comparison to me .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The invasion of Iraq was a resumption of warfare that ended in a cease fire . It was not technically a new war requiring all the congressional steps . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not to derail this thread -- we can talk about this more in the Politics section -- but the last time the US Congress declared war was for WWII . So the conflict in Iraq is not in fact a resumption of a prior declared war .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're technically correct . However , the Gulf War was approved by Congress whether it was a declared war or not . The Iraq War was a continuation of the same conflict after a cease fire . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I understand the Bush administration has made this argument , but I don't think it has a whole lot of merit . It was a different presidential administration and the reasons for the conflict were different -- to repel the invasion of Kuwait . Not to mention that the same logical argument could be used to begin a fresh invasion of Vietnam or Korea .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I think not . Those conflicts ended in something other than a cease fire .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>187<br>S1 argues that in spite of the vitriol employed, comparing interracial and gay marriage is a useful analogy. Opponents of gay marriage use similar arguments as those employed by opponents of interracial marriage. S2 argues that this comparison is irrelevant, he has not mentioned religion or interracial marriage in his opposition to gay marriage. In fact, none of the tropes associated with interracial marriage actually apply. He has instead argued that redefining marriage would require redefining several other cultural practices as well. He has also proposed that those seeking to enjoy same sex marriage are doing so out of some form of self-shame. S1 argues that words and associated cultural practices are redefined all the time, providing the example of "war" to illustrate his point. In comparison to these major re-definitions, redefining what constitutes a valid marriage seems minor in comparison. S2 brings up a counterpoint to S1's argument about war. S1 clarifies S2's argument about war to illustrate how S2's example is in accordance with S1's original statement. S1 stands by his previous counter-example.<br><b> key:   </b>1-5811_33_29__35_38_40_41_43_2 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Don't you think that in 1909 it was probably viewed mostly from a moral standpoint ? I don't think they saw it the same way they would see black people . They didn't even realize that ' homosexuality ' was any sort of innate thing . It was entirely behavioral to them . I tend to agree with the court , even given what you've said . I doubt for 1909 it was about prejudice and bigotry -- they genuinely felt it was wrong . The concept of gay marriage was completely foreign and unknown in 1909 . It wasn't even something they conceived of . I think the court is saying that they couldn't have been prejudiced against something they didn't even know of or conceive of .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Hogwash . It was once entirely moral to believe certain races were inferior , and that women had fewer rights than men . Treating the races and women as equal was not something even thought of by many . It was prejudice against gays then , and it still is today . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>This is not really true . It's a popular misconstruing of morality and history by proponents of modern ' rights ' movements , but it's not true . There's little historical backing to the idea that people believed oppressing black people was a right thing to do , as in , doing good . There were times they used an argument where religion was wrongly used to justify their behavior , but that's a different matter . If you firmly believe otherwise , I'd challenge you to show where people thought oppressing blacks was an example if doing good . The same goes for misogyny . Furthermore , it's beside the point anyway . We're talking about homosexuality . In 1909 , the only thing they really understood about the issue at hand was that some people engaged in sexual relations with people of their own gender . There were no articles about " homosexuality " as a trait , and certainly none about genetic causes . It was understood entirely from a behavioral standpoint , and therefore a moral standpoint . So it's not hogwash at all -- they really did view gay sex as immoral . If you don't think so , then you have a very poor grasp on history in this case .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This kind of morality is based on nothing but ignorance ( which you admit ) and prejudice . What kind of a basis is that for a so-called moral code ? So what if it involves behaviour ? Gay people have sex , develop relationships , and bond , just like everyone else , but in a way that reflects their gay sexuality . This does not mean people could not be prejudiced about the way gay people live . People were , and are so prejudiced . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>A better reverse analogy would have been to say " So then conversly I have the right to advocate that heterosexual relations are morally wrong " . Not heterosexuality , since it's not homosexuality ( as it's a state of being ) that religious people have a problem with . Heck , they often don't even recognize it . With that caveat , yes you are certainly free to advocate whatever you want to be morally wrong . ( And unlike the way some in your movement do , I won't call you a " bigot " for doing so ! ) It may have been based on " ignorance " , but I reject the notion it was based on prejudice ( and therefore I tend to agree with the 6 - 0 view of the justices here ) . The 1909 society had too little understanding of gay people to be prejudiced over in the first place . Remember , homosexuality was not understood as a state of being at that time . The term itself had not been around long and was not known to most people . And even to those it was known to , it was not known as a state of being . And there certainly was no social identity among gay people as a group -- how could prejudice have existed if there was nothing ( from their perspective ) to be prejudiced toward ?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Right . Provided gays don't live gay , but live straight , gays can be as gay as they want . As long as gays don't outwardly show what makes them different from straights , gays can be as gay as they want . It's bs . Also some may not recognize the existence of gay people or their gay lives , but that is putting one's head in the sand . Nonsense . People would widely and hatefully use the term " sodomite " to refer to gays . Before that the term was " molly " . Clearly there was an identity they were prejudiced towards . They were rounding up gays in areas they were known to attend , and putting them in prison . Read up on the trial of Oscar Wilde . Gays may have been forced underground , to a greater extent , but that does not mean they were not thought of . Gays were just not thought of in a nice way . Gays were purposely kept out of everything in society , when society didn't really think of gays as human too . That isn't prejudice ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Because they didn't approve of sodomy ! Do you not agree they didn't understand the concept of homosexuality ??? There was no social identity . When they were put on trial , it wasn't because they were gay ( which they had no concept of ) , it was because they had gay relations which society viewed as wrong ! No , here's where you don't get it -- it's not that " gays " ( there was no concept of that ) were purposely kept out of of everything , it's that people who had sodomy relationships were kept out of everything , because sodomy was viewed as wrong . They really did think it was wrong ! You are so determined to portray everything that has anything to do with gay relations possibly being wrong as prejudice and bigotry that you are close-minded about it .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>186<br>S1 argues that homosexuality was understood to be a choice rather than an innate characteristic in the past. As a result, gay marriage could have never been considered right. S2 argues that this view is incorrect, anti-gay bigotry has always been anti-gay bigotry. S1 disagrees, stating that S2's opinion about past views on gay rights were misrepresentations brought about by modern gay rights proponents. Further, S1 states that S2's argument is ultimately irrelevant, gay behavior was, in the past, ultimately seen as immoral in nature. S2 argues that the morality underlying anti-gay rights agendas is based on ignorance and bigotry, which should make it invalid as a foundation for determining moral behavior. S1 reaffirms his belief that past classifications of homosexuality were based on their best understanding of the practice. S2 argues that  according to S1, gays are fine so long as they remain in hiding. Further, historically, people used slurs against gays and persecuted homosexuals, demonstrating their understanding of homosexuality as a behavioral choice.

Global warming is an important issue that has the potential to affect everyone . Democrats are conserned about all the issues you have raised . The Democrats certainly did a better job fiscally , keeping the books ballanced , when they were in power . But Republicans care about giving their rich elite friends tax breaks , no matter what the cost . They divide everyone else with fear , ignorance and irrational prejudice .

Now , THERE'S some revisionist history . It was a Republican Congress that first balanced the budget after gaining control of the HR for the first time in 40 years .

Some of the right-wing are so worried another group of people will get their due constitutional rights , they want to change the constitution to prevent it . Will they do this for other groups who want equal rights ? It's certainly up for debate which side is being more manipulative . You want to impose your personal and religious morality on everyone else , by giving those who don't share your beliefs , fewer rights .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The manipulation came when gays married in Mass attempted to use the " Full Faith and Credit Clause as a means to force the acceptance of gay marriage on te rest of the contry . The Full Faith and Credit Clause was never intended , nor does it apply to marriage laws . The FFaCC holds for court judgements , but not licenses . It's no different that having a driver's license in MI at age 16 , but not being allowed to drive in NY until you're 18 , even if you hold a valid MI driver's license . There are dozens of such precedents for not acknowledging licenses issued in other states . The 10th Amendment says that those rights not specifically given to the Feds belong to the State or individuals . In many states , the people have decided whether or not gay marriage should be allowed and have exercised their 10th Amendment right to self-govern .

They are very loud and clear on this point . They would put their personal opinions in to law that subjugate gay people . President Obama has said that he believes that marriage is between a man and a woman but he is not willing to put his personal beliefs into law . He has done everything he can to support the marriage equality position . He has said that he favors a system of strong civil unions . Besides if Obama wins reelection then he will come out for full marriage equality . No other president in US history has done more for the gay community the president Obama . He has been our strong advocate in the white house . The problem for you is that you fall on the side of imposing your moral views upon others and can not understand why someone would not want to .

S1 notes that these are past not present US policies and unlikely to happen again. S2 is not so sure. S1 asks if S2's solution is to put a protection for gays in the US constitution. S2 proposes limiting religious influence upon society as a suitable means of providing protection for homosexuals in America.<br><b> key:   </b>1-1281_466_275__483_561_576_625_633_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Give us a break , the bibe saying ' in the future there will be Wars ... and Earthquakes !

Abortions an unwed couples seems to have pretty much nothing to do with the last line . As for minorities and the constitution , the majority can change the constitution or just ignore it . It is in the majorities interest to support and accept minorities because pretty much everyone falls within one of them and minorites still have a significant number of people , maybe not the most important but enough to swing power between forces competting over the majority .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The number of earthquales that have happened outside of Israel in the last 100 yrs is exponentially increased .

I haven't been argued that homosexuality is right according to religious beleifs , but more often that your religious beleifs should have nothing to do with my life . Acceptance of homosexuality effecting plate tectonics ? Time to come back to the real world , even if it is true , why should you worship a being that is quite happy to destroy homes and kill people for becoming more tolerant but is quite happy with the famine and AIDS situation and doesn't get involved with politics ? The constitution is not magic , it has been changed because enough people wanted it done , if the majority wants to ignore or change a part of the consititution it will do .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>First opff Jake started this rel ; igious topic . Reread the posts I'm only refuting his assertions . I did not say homosexuality is the cause of anything religious only citing support against Jake's comments . Don't ever try to assume you know God's mentality . Most parents love their children but they raise them according to how they feel is best . According tro what they know . Why are some parents motivator and others discipliners ? That's my popint if the majority want it they will do it . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And I refute your refutations . You implied that the Earthquakes were not a natural thing and dinviinly caused Even if there is a god , any ' loving parent ' that kills some of its children to make a point , when they are fully capable of just changing the issue anyway is hardly deserving of worship . As for people changing , not only is that dubious anyway but not really proof of anything , there are alcoholics who recover and don't drink and that is definitely genetically influenced . You clearly have no real idea about the state of genetic research or how it works , we are nowhere near finding the purpose of everything . There doesn't appear to be one gene , but there is probably a combination that lead to a greater chance of being gay . @ Rev , Power of Attorney would be fine , but giving that there is already favouritism shown to some people , why should that favouritism be arteficailly restricted . In the interest of fairness it seems a lot easy to recognise a few more people in an existing group that abolishing it . Also not everyone shares your view on the purpose and role of a government<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No you refute your inferences No I didn't Who said God killed them ? For someoen that claims there is no God it's amazing how you're the expert now on the nature of God . i agree there is a disposition but that doesn't mean that they are genetically confined as the alcoholic isn't . So why draw the line at homosexuals ? Why not polygamists ? Why do homosexuals deserve the right and polygamists don't ? What merits do homosexuality bring that polygamy doesn't ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So that little peice of geological trivia was just that , and had nothing to do with this debate or any points whatsoever ? Perhaps some people are capable of thinking from another's point of view , if God is a loving parent I can't see how you can justify the view that anything lethal can be used as a punishment . I don't think you know how genetics works in this instance . Or do you think that the method of upbringing they have is purely responisble ? I don't really see any real problem with polygamy itself , but it would have to be watched a little more carefully perhaps as the cultures that practise polygamy tend to be less focused on equality between sexs . As long as you make sure that the marriages are still volentary for both partners and that any person is fully able to leave if they want to then I can't really see the problem . However it is a lot more complicated if you are looking from the benefits point of view with respect to inheritance and other aspects ( child support and suchlike ) but these are realitively minor points that would just have to be worked out if this type of marriage was to be recognised<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>186<br>S1 argues that Biblical prophecy is not proof of America heading in the wrong direction from a religious perspective. S2 notes that the number of earthquakes seen in the last century have increased dramatically, providing evidence to the contrary. S1 argues that a pre-existing religious belief is necessary for any evidence regarding earthquakes to be relevant. S1 argues that religion should be excluded from determining the cause of common events. Further, if God is willing to cause earthquakes because people accept homosexuality but ignores greater tragedies, then God's ultimate benevolence is up for question. All that is required is that enough people want to accept homosexuality for such acceptance to be socially correct. S2 states that S1 is purposefully misunderstanding S2's statements and that God's motivations are ultimately unknowable. S2 argues that S1 is claiming to know the nature of homosexuality and God alike without being an expert on the situation. S2 then asks why gays should be considered acceptable but polygamists are not. S1 admits he sees no problems with polygamy being allowed either.<br><br><b>worker_id </b>A3RRSDNNBE0VVI<br>HITid:</b>  341H3G5YF0E8GR1XNTWQKKDH73Q0ZV<br> <b>Status:</b>Approved<br><b> key:   </b>1-6646_209_208__210_211_212_214_215_239_7 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>[ QUOTE = gaetano ; 255273 ] As you say , marriage is a public institution and like all institutions has its rules and requirements .

Can you not put youself in the place of gay people and ask yourself how would I feel ? Do you have any empathy ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>In answer to your first question as it stands , No , it happens all the time . If society had set up the institution of marriage as a gay one since OG was in his cave then I would certainly try and lobby otherwise if I disagreed . If the lobbying failed and the rest of Society said we keep things the way we want them however sorry they may feel , then I would clearly have to abide by that , although lobbying would continue . However castigating people because of their beliefs or stating they shouldn't have them , must be wrong . Otherwise I could claim that you are not entitled to your beliefs which clearly you are<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That is not what I asked you . Do you really lack any empathy ? I didn't ask you what you would do I asked you how you would feel . Let's try again How would you feel if the world was the other way around ?

Can you not put youself in the place of gay people and ask yourself how would I feel ? Do you have any empathy ? For the record I do not believe I have the right to tell anyone who they should be allowed to marry but many of those that are anti same sex marriage think that they have a right to tell people who they should be allowed to marry . Just because something happens all the time does not mean it is not cruel and unjust . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>First of all it is not against " someone else's beliefs " in that incredibly simplistic way . It is against the beliefs of society since the year dot , religious beliefs or ' ikk ' factor whatever that is are irrelevant even if they contribute to some people's attitudes . Second yes I would probably feel sad if I wasn't allowed to marry the person I was with BUT I would be with the person I love in any event . Thirdly , as marriage is looked on as a public institution then Society as a whole is entitled to lay down the rules relating to it just as Society lays down the rules and laws by which we live . Cruelty and injustice occur when you are stopped from doing something you are entitled to do . Gay marriage at present is not something you are entitled to it would seem . Have to say in the UK we have made some steps towards that .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I really think you can not put yourself in someone elses place . So you believe that " Cruelty and injustice occur when you are stopped from doing something you are entitled to do . " ? Is this correct ? So if I use your belief on another topic , say slavery , you then would conclude that slavery was neither cruel nore injust 1 since it was a legal and traditional activity practiced since OG was in the cave 2 slaves should not think it was cruel and unjust because they had no legal rights and standing and thus was not cruel and unjust since they were slaves . My point is just because something is the law or not the law does not make it any less cruel or unjust when viewed from a certain perspective . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Firstly I am not even going to put slavery on the same level as gay marriage . I frankly do not believe that the alleged suffering gays not being allowed to marry comes in any way close to the suffering of slaves . Secondly you are of course perfectly correct about cruelty and injustice ( neither or certainly the first one do I think apply to gay marriage ) and the way forward was to lobby etc as Wilberforce did to abolish slave trade . We can only advance in civilisation ( I hope ) but lobbying publicity etc can help people's awareness in bring matters before their eyes to decide on . There will always be minorities of dissenters ( strange world if none ) but in the last analysis Society determines how it is run . You talk about the tyranny of the majority but of course the reverse can also be true .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I am not comparing the two . I am using your own beliefs and statements and appling them to slavery .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>183<br>S1 and S2 are debating gay marriage. S1 argues that gay marriage should be decided by a public vote. S2 argues that it's cruel to limit someone else from enjoying rights you can currently enjoy. Opponents of gay marriage should try to have more empathy for gay people who wish to marry. S1 retorts that it is not cruel for society to bar someone from enjoying a particular right. Society can and does decide what it deems to be socially acceptable through consensus.  S2 states that tradition or being mundane does not make something any more wrong or right.  S2 compares S1's argument to a justification for slavery.  The majority once held slavery to be correct, hence it was morally and socially acceptable according to S1's logic. S1 says that he is not arguing for something being correct because it's traditional, only that it can be changed through convincing society to change.  It is up to society to determine what is permissible through a dialog between the proponents of gay marriage and society.<br><b> key:   </b>1-10349_9_5__17_40_43_50_52_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>The cultural meaning of marriage is a formalization of a mating pair , who , in turn , create and support a family unit . Love and reproduction are implied . The legal meaning of marriage is , in most States , a contract between two people who are not under the age of consent , of different genders , of the same species , not closely related and who are not already married . Homosexuals are not a part of the traditional or cultural meaning of marriage . In order to be included , the meaning of marriage would have to change . The catch-22 is that homosexual couples want to be included in the current meaning of marriage , but what gives marriage meaning specifically excludes homosexual couples .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That's your definition . It is certainly not my definition . You don't speak for all of society . I personally define marriage as a union of two people who love one another and wish to make a commitment to one another . If marriage is about reproduction , why does nobody bat an eye when a 65 year old woman marries a 68 year old man ? If you believe marriage is " formalization of a mating pair " , and " reproduction is implied " , doesn't this cheapen the institution of marriage in your eyes ? Obviously , they are not getting married to start a family ... perhaps love is what is important ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Mating pairs exist with or without marriage , and have no legal connection with marriage ( since , legally , it doesn't matter if the two people even like one another , or ever intend on consumating said marriage ) . The only connection between a mating couple and marriage is the connection made on a cultural level . So , logically , the cultural meaning of marriage would be the purpose of a mating couple . While ' purpose ' can mean different things , in this context I daresay most would refer to the evolutionary purpose of a mating couple : reproduction . Love is implied because love brings the couple together for that purpose . While legally a 27 yr old marrying a 70 yr old sugar daddy is not a problem , culturally speaking this marriage is not as meaningful as one that is in-line with the evolutionary purpose I outlined above . You can point to exceptions all you want , but all it does is outline the difference between the legal meaning and the cultural meaning of marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Who gave you the power to decide what is culturally meaningful ? And more importantly , should we legally define marriage based on your perception of " cultural meaning " ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No , you should legally define it any damn way you can get away with . The cultural definition comes from observation .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But who get's to decide that legal definition ... that's the point . In this specific case in point , the anti crowd wishes to limit the rights of others simply based on personally held beliefs ... when no harm is presented to any party involved . In a case such as this , I feel strongly that without a specific vector of harm , we must as a civilized society rule in favor of providing equal rights rather than limit rights of a minority . I think these 4 pages thus far make clear that cultural definition is based on subjective obeservation and personal opinion formed via that observation . Clearly , I and many others here do not share your cultural definition . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>In America the people generally vote on issues , or elect representatives to enact laws . That's how you change the legal definitions . This isn't about equality , snakespit . The title of this thread shows that :P In all seriousness , though , it really isn't about equality . I don't think you have a rational basis upon which to dispute that observation . It is an indisputible fact that the cultural view that has dominated this country ( as evidenced by the definition of marriage ) generally follows evolutionarily sound logic : monogamous pair bonding outside of close familial ties . Inclusion of homosexuals would obviously change that .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>184<br>S1 argues that marriage has a specific and deeply embedded definition within culture. Marriage is a formalized mating pair. Marriage's legal definition closely mirrors that definition. Homosexual marriage has never been an explicit or implicit part of those definitions. Including it would make the definition of marriage inherently self-contradictory. S2 argues that S1 is exercising a subjective definition. S2 notes that different members of society have different definitions of marriage. Further, there are instances of accepted marriage which violate S1's provided definitions. Instead, love, the emotional connection is what is most important.  S1 argues that legal and cultural definitions are not the same. The cultural definition is what is important. Most associate marriage with producing offspring, hence it is deemed important in the cultural definition. S2 questions S1's authority to determine what is culturally important and whether his cultural definition is appropriate for a legal definition. S1 says appropriateness is irrelevant. Cultural definitions have formed the root of all other definitions. The cultural definition of marriage has always been one male and female in monogamy.<br><b> key:   </b>1-10349_72_70__75_82_83_84_85_86_87_88_89_90_94_95_99_4 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>I'm speaking of everyone who lives in the society ... it's implicit that we agree to live by the laws of that society :P A social contract , if you will .

If the meaning were solely based upon religion then it would be an arbitrary custom . But it's based upon biology , which isn't an arbitrary difference .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>As long as 70 year olds are allowed to marry then you have lost that arguement . What is the difference between a couple of 70 year olds and a gay couple ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>A heterosexual bond's ultimate causation is to facilitate reproduction .

The lack of is what I find unconstitutional and unjust . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Surely , and in your little scenario married people still have benefits that you don't get . So it's a lie that you'd ' be ok with that ' since you've been pretty loudly outspoken about that very point . That if anyone has benefits you don't get then it must be unconstitutional .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I have had this idea for years . http://www.4forums.com/political/gay...man-woman.html <br><b>S1:4-  </b>lol , so what ? You've also been braying about how if some people have benefits that you don't have access to ( and in your scenario it would be much less possible for you to get those benefits ) then it must be unconstitutional . So either you're a hypocrite or you don't actually pay attention to what you say .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I actually have a marriage license . The same license that everyone gets from the state of Iowa , yet my license is not recognized by either the federal government or the state of Michigan , how is that not unconstitutional ? Why are those the only two options ? I want equality and I don't care how it comes about . If my rules where applied to marriage , yes it would suck , but I would then be treated equally to those heteros , who currently do not breed , can not breed , or choose not to breed , yet can get a marriage license at the drop of a hat and have it recognized . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Because the Constitution does not require them to :P It has been long established that States have authority over marriage definitions . Because , gasp , they get marriage benefits while you do not ! Are you saying it's equal for some people to get marriage benefits but single people do not ?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>What is it about the same piece of paper you do not understand ? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>The reason you have that paper is the same reason other States don't have to honor it . That reason is : States decide for themselves what constitutes a marriage . I'm still interested in the fact that you're ok with some people getting marriage benefits and others not getting them .<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Once again the state of Iowa issues one piece of paper to everyone . What part of that do you not understand ? The other states and the federal government must recognize all or none . If marriage is to be about breeders and breeding children , and my rules are adopted by the state then yes I am alright . If my rules were adopted then almost no one would get married , and those who get married have to breed if they don't they are no longer married . They have to have 3 witnesses to their act of breeding , along with a video of the event stored in the public records of the county were they live . <br><b>S1:7-  </b>I understand every part of that . Nothing makes States recognize all or none , Matthew S. In fact , it's been true since the ratification that States establish their own marriage laws ... and anyone in the State is subject to those marriage laws . It doesn't matter what other States say about your marriage because you're not in those States . No you aren't because some people would have marriage benefits but you will not . You've been very vocal that if anyone gets marriage benefits when you do not then it must be unconstitutional . Are you now saying that it's perfectly Constitutional for only some people to get marriage benefits ? And you're wrong , of course . People would get married . Besides ' having witnesses ' ( which is for the signing of the contract not the execution , duh ) , a lifelong relationship with children is the ideal marriage . It's what people hope to have .<br><b> S2:7-  </b>And why would gay people be any different ? What we have is you saying to me that I can't get married because you have some belief against it . I wish I could say to you , you can't go to that place or do that thing because I have a belief against you doing so . <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Saying heterosexuals are the same as homosexuals is political fiction .

They are free to be changed but not broken. Society's definition of marriage is not based merely on religion, but on biology. S2 argues that people who are not able to reproduce but can marry invalidates S1's argument. S1 reiterates that the ultimate intended goal of marriage is to make reproduction easier. Bringing up exceptions to does not change anything. S1 argues that S2's opposition to gay marriage bans stems from not receiving benefits that a married couple does. S2 argues that gay marriage bans are unequal and unjust. S2 emphasizes universal equality and desires to be treated just as heterosexual people who do not reproduce are in terms of the ability to marry.

I didn't bring up religon in my argument . Jake did . So please don't specualte anything until you knwo what we're talking about . All laws are based upon morals . So it is based upon the morals of the country whcih happen to be predominantly Christian . England was one of many countries . There is no new family structure that didn't exist before this country . My definition of negative effect is that the puposes for which something is created is hindered or compromises . By changing standards there is a harm to it's integrity . Intregrity is compromised when it isn't stable . Soemthing that changes all teh time loses that integrity like John Kerry on his views . Things must remain consistent to be integral . This argument has a flaw . That when there is guaranteed religous freedomw then we dont ' have equal rights . Everyone has equal rights in terms of believing . However behavior is regualted by the government . Therefore we can do anyting in the name of religion until it violates behavior that is acceptable by society .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Fine , so what if the government said people are free to ' believe ' in God , but any sign of them putting their belief into practice , such as going to church or even just praying in private was illegal ? Would that be acceptable ? After all it is just regulating behaviourA , not belief ? Your comparisons are ludicrous . All of these situations involve non-consensual acts either through lack of knowledge or involvement of minors . You cannot compare that to consensual acts between adults . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That probably wouldn't be acceptable to most people but it would be legal and equal . They don't allow religious practices of polygamy , animal or human sacrifices , body mutilation , and many other religious practices . So then we should allow prostitution , polygamy , human trafficking , drug trafficking , gambling , drug distribution , and all other consensual acts .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But they obviously wouldn't be equal , because a significant proportion of the population would be restricted from worshipping how they want in a for that hurts nobody . These elements mostly have links to crime over and above the act itself , that justifies restrictions . Homosexuality doesn't . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The poeple would be equal . The religions would not . Look at our country . Almost all Christian beleifs are legal and no other non-Christians Churches have almost all their legal beleifs . That's it ? Crime ? That's it . The criminal link ? So if they criminalized homosexuality then it would be okay to ban gay marriage . Homosexuality has links to crime too . Sodomy is a crime . Define harm becaue homosexuality is harmful according to many .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>This is not equality . You are using the letter of the law to twist the purpose of the law , and even then doing it using very shaky logic . Equality is about general concepts , not specifics . It is equality to say ' everyone is has the same right to worship who they want ' , it is not equality to say ' everyone has the same right to worship who we tell them to ' . That is equality within an unequal system , which cannot be counted . Can you re-phrase , I don't follow . No . As I said , those have strong links to criminal activity irrespective of the act itself being a crime . For example drug use has noted links to theft , the same just cannot be said for homosexuality . No it isn't . And even if it was , that has nothing to do with homosexuality anyway . Physical or psychological injury or damage . Homosexuality is therefore in no way harmful . And I have serous doubts about the ' many ' who say it is . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Equality is treating every person the same . However it does not mean treating every person's behavior the same . It does not mean treat every organization the same either . Everyone has the same rights . NOt every religous practice , ideology , or behavior get the same treatment . Teh people determine what is in the public's interest to protect and ban . It basically only the Christian practices that are completely legal . Islamic polgamy and other religons don't have their practices recognized as often as christianity . Homosexuality has strong links to sodomy . Also prostitution is legal in Nevada so shoudl all states be forced to allow taht behavior ? Insome states adults cann have sex wiht 14 - 16 yr olds in some cases . Should other states recognize that too ? Most serial killers of men and young boys were homosexuals . Sodomy is a crime do you wnat me to post it ? gynocologist , Gi specialists , and colon specialist have all stated the effects homosexual related activites .

S1 is against gay marriage but adamantly states his objection is not based on religion but because there are laws prohibiting the practice.

S1 advises he would still support the law as there are already laws banning certain religious practices such as polygamy.  He advises that even though such a thing would most likely not happen, he would still support it because it would be fair and equal toward all.  S1 contends that if this were the case, crime rate would increase due to the banning of religious freedom, in a sense.

I will make one point here . Heterosexual marriage is one of the most universal of all human institutions , found in almost all cultures ever existing . With a precedent like that , the question isn't , " Why Mr. Galton are you opposed to gay marriage ? " The question is how do you justify revolutionizing that ancient institution ? To me , heterosexual marriage is the Parthenon : ancient , beautiful , crumbling some of late , but it would be a tragedy to knock it down , clear it out , and put in a new building . You prove to me why that new building is so gotdamn necessary .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It is circular to say marriage has simply always been heterosexual , end of debate . No one is talking about knocking down marriage . Gay families want to enter into it , because they want their families strengthened and protected as heterosexual families have been strenghtened and protected . Gay families want into the institution because they want to be a positive influence on it , to support it and to shore it up , not because they desire to harm it . They are fighting to get into it , as some heterosexuals can't wait to get out of it . I can't see if it would make such a dramatic change just because the couple are the same sex . Also marriage in the U.S. and Canada falls under common-law . This is a " living law " meant to evolve with society , with much room for interpretation by judges . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You're gonna have to explain your circularity argument for us slow folks . And you're gonna have to back up your statement that gays as a group are really in their hearts conservatives , with a love of traditional institutions like marriage . I strongly suspect that you have some homosexuals who want the right to marriage for romantic reasons , some who want it for economic / legal privilege reasons , but also very many who want it so as to affirm that homosexuality is just as good as heterosexuality . It's the idea of we're just as good as you are , so we must be able to have everything you can have . For many , I suspect it is not a desire to adopt a more conservative lifestyle , but to make a point , and move the culture toward greater acceptance . This is a risky gamble to shove this down peoples ' throats as it may cause a backlash instead of greater legitimization of the lifestyle . Oh and you've got to be kidding me that gay marriage doesn't revolutionize marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Takes us back to where we started , assumes it absolutely must be and cannot be different or change . Sure , there are many who want acceptance from society , parents , friends , and that is a big reason why they marry , for gays or straights . If gays want their marriages to compete with heterosexual marriages , to prove gay marriages can be more successful , wouldn't that be good for the institution ? The old fashioned backlash argument is not a reason to not do something , and frankly is a little tired and worn-out in 2004 . Gays are just as good as you are . Is there a problem with gays believing and acting like they are just as good ? We don't have the strong sense of different gender roles we once had , so why is it such a revolutionary change ? I can't see that it has revolutionized the societies where it is in effect . It could have represented the next step in a very gradual continuation of acceptance that had been going on for a long time . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I am not arguing that heterosexual marriage must be as it has been or cannot be different . I am arguing that that revolutionizing such an important , ancient institution requires some heavy justification . People who have no respect for the past may not find my point compelling ; people who look to the past with deep respect and see in it old wisdom will find it compelling . I for one do not want to revolutionize an ancient institution I have great respect for , in order so the gay community can prove something . Tired argument ?! My god , how long have we been debating gay marriage ? Only four or five years ago in grad school , we were discussing how difficult it would be to see more and more rights to be extended to cohabiting gays couples , and we talked a little bit about gay civil unions . Marriage wasn't even on the damn table ! Homosexuality is an eccentricity ; in my mind it is not equal in value to heterosexuality . This is not an issue of how gays believe and act ; it is an issue of whether we are going to enshrine homosexual marriage as we do with heterosexual marriage . Gender , sexuality , and family organization are absolutely fundamental aspects of society -- always have been , always will be .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes , the hetero-only definition of marriage has been around a long time . However , simply because something is traditional does not make it just . Well that's how you see it because of your contempt for the gay community . You see it as " them " trying to step out of their lower place , or prove they are not lower than you and equal in value . Your last comment I've dealt with in this post , demonstrates that very well . Yes , the backlash threat is tired and boring . No one is listening anymore . Well , I remember people talking about marriage for gays and lesbians and their rights for much longer . Well , that says it all about where you are coming from . You believe homosexuals are human beings of lesser value . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I believe homosexual behavior is an eccentricity and not equal in value to heterosexuality . I was not referring to the value of persons ; I think homosexuals have as much intrinsic value as anyone else . I have contempt for no one . Your attempt to paint people who disagree with you as haters is unfair and a cheap debate tactic .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Homosexuals are persons who have homosexual behaviour . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>We are all sophisticated enough to separate behavior from person . I don't have to tell you that homosexuals are MUCH more than whom they prefer to sleep with .<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Yes , there is also homosexual orientation , which is part of the person's homosexual identity , and part of the person's homosexuality . The orientation leads to the behaviour .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>185<br>S1 and S2 are discussing the topic of gay marriage rights.  S1 states he is not exactly opposed to gay marriage but would like someone to give valid reasoning behind restructuring the basis of marriage since it's been the same since the beginning of time, comparing it to the Parthenon.  S2 feels it is circular to classify marriage as simply heterosexual.  He believes no one is attempting to take away the idea of marriage, just asking for homosexual couples to be included in the fray.  S1 disagrees with S2's statements that at the root, most homosexuals fighting for marriage rights are doing so on a conservative note.  He feels instead that the reasons are a "we are entitled to what you have" mentality.  S2 disagrees stating that while many do want acceptance from society, most want marriage for the basic reasons of marriage.  He also feels S1's arguments support the notion that laws should stay absolute and cannot be changed or altered.  S1 disagrees with this statement advising he simply wants the reasons supported.<br><b> key:   </b>1-7185_117_110__122_126_134_148_150_151_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>The court upheld equal protections . You accuse the court of illegitimate " judicial activism " for upholding such protections . Obviosly so far as you are concerned , if equal protections are upheld for gay Americans , it's illegitimate . Obviously not in the states that prohibit it . Can't you read the laws ? Indeed , the state and federal laws on the issue are specifically directed against gay people . It is woefully disingenuous of you to pretend otherwise . Another case of malicious disingenuity . Not even you can take it seriously with a straight face that these laws don't exist because gay people insist on equal rights , and homophobes want to deny them . If you don't know what equality means , by all means invest in a dictionary . Then you haven't much understanding of it . It applies to this case , and there are a large number of court decisions that agree with this understanding , this being just the latest . The straw men are all in your posts .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why can't you answer my question ? I simply said that it is illegitimate to say the constitution means one thing when it never has . I certainly can and there is nothing saying they can't within the restrictions by the law . Perhaps you don't . Let's look at marriage as an example . Marriage restrictions based on age , sex , species , number of , capacity , and perhaps a few other things . If you want " equal protection " the way you define it then all of these restrictions ( short of capacity ) would have to be removed . Is this what you mean by equal protection ? There seems to be more that disagree with you but that is beside the point . The only way you get to equal protection meaning what you want it to mean is if you evolve the constitution to a new meaning . If you can prove to me how gay marriage was part of the original meaning of the term " equal protection " then I'd be very much impressed . nice response Can you show me where I made a strawman ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Oh dear . I suppose I am extremely stupid in thinking that when a constitution says equal protections under the law , it means equal protections under the law . Evidently , it means : " Except gays " .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Can you show a document that suggests the original meaning of " equal protection " means equality for gays but not for other groups ? If you like I can explain the original understanding of the 14th amendment and how it wouldn't apply to gays unless they were denied marriage as defined today for being gay . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Can you show us a document that shows equality applies to groups other than gays ? Where does the Constitution say , " Except gays " ? Do you seriously imagine gay people want to marry the opposite sex ? Do you seriously think it is not an obstacle to their pursuit of life , liberty and happiness to prevent them from marrying the partners they love ? After all , you folk take your right to marry the consenting adults you love for granted , but for some pig-headed reason , you think it's OK to deny gay Americans the same rights you have . And you think that's constitutional ? Steve , that's bigotry .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are borderline breaking the rules of the forum . That aside , did you want me to explain the meaning of equal protection or not ? If it makes you feel better I wouldn't think it was denial of equal protection if marriage was denied as two men or two women marrying each other . No , they can't marry each other . Not sure how that is protection but if it is then consider gays protected too . I'm not saying you should think the way I do but at least I am trying to answer your questions and respond to your points . All you seem to be doing is ignoring my posts and insulting me . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>yawn . But since that is the denial of equal rights , obviously you would be wrong to think that . Nope . A very disingenuous argument . Gay partnerships are NOT protected the same way as straight ones -- in many places , they are illegal . That would be obvious even to a blind man , but not to someone deliberately denying the facts . I am pointing out that your opinions are wrong . As to why you make the erroneous arguments you do , i can only surmise .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No because in that case everyone is still allowed to marry under what marriage means . so is a daughter and father relationship which was the topic at hand ... Why are they wrong ? Why can't you explain why denial of some things that aren't equal is ok and doesn't violate equal protection but with gay marriage it does ?

S1 is in favor of gay marriage while S2 is against it.  S2 feels if allowances are altered to allow gay marriage, then the other restrictions would need removed as well.  He also feels doing so would reduce moral judgment.  S1 disagrees advising the general consensus is that all people are entitled to equal rights except when they include gays.  S2 argues there is no document defining equal rights making S1's argument invalid.  S1 defends his original argument by saying the Constitution as it is defined right now prevents homosexuals from their rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  He also feels that supporting the rules remaining the same amounts to bigotry.  S2 argues this by stating his feelings that if laws were altered to allow gay marriage, they would also need to be altered to allow things such as incest marriages, challenging S1 to offer information to support why gay marriage laws should be passed; however, a ban remain on other such unions.</p><br><br><b>worker_id </b>A2B2U8VNS9DK94<br>HITid:</b>  3PUV2Q8SV446XDZBTR4ID9QXAPCDBU<br> <b>Status:</b>Approved<br><b> key:   </b>1-9391_147_145_1_157_162_165_170_187_191_196_197_13 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>And rimming some dude's hairy bung is soooo appealing by comparison ?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What DVDs have you been watching , JP ?

In a similar dig, S1 suggests that S2 is a closet homosexual because he purports not to know about the gay community's frequent use of highway rest stops as places to hook up.  S1 believes it is an exercise of moral character to use the political process to prevent marriage from becoming bastardized.  S2 argues that recognition of loving committed gay marriage would not be bastardizing the institution of marriage.  The two feel they have similar understandings of references to Ted Haggard and Sartre and use the term gloryhole with a meaning that is not entirely clear from this dialog.<br><b> key:   </b>1-2280_102_99__104_113_117_118_120_121_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Although Jim and MrWrite's debate has devolved into an unfortunate battle of screw you's , the comparison of the arguments against interacial marriage and those against gay marriage has some merit . At least that's what this article suggests : Opponents of gay marriage use many of the same arguments as foes of interracial relationships did before Loving v . Virginia outlawed state bans on interracial marriage in 1967 , said law professor Kim Forde-Mazrui at a talk sponsored by the Center for the Study of Race and Law and Lambda Law Alliance Sept . 30 . http://www.law.virginia.edu/home2002...fall/forde.htm<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This is not relevant to my argument at all . I have mentioned nothing about religious beliefs or bible-thumping protests against homosexuality . I did not bring interacial marriage into the discussion because it does not apply . I'm not against interacial marriage as long as there's a man and a woman involved . I did not bring the silly argument about water fountains into the discussion . Separate-but-equal does apply in the sense that records of legally recognized couples would separate married couples from same-sex couples but would not justify any inequalities regarding their rights and privileges . Hospital visitation , inheritance and other things could be afforded both . I'm wondering if those who insist on same-sex couples being called " married " are not acting somewhat from self-imposed shame ... like you want to hide the fact that you are gay . My argument has thusfar been limited to the requirement to redefine several other words if we redefine " marriage " . It has nothing to do with homophobia which , by the way , I do not suffer from . I have some friends that are gay and they know how I feel about the word " marriage " . We remain friends . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I accept your argument at face value , although I will say that I believe that the majority of people who argue against gay marriage do so for religious or homophobe reasons . ( Again , I'm not saying you fall into these categories . ) Words get redefined all the time , and some of them are just as important as the word ' marriage ' . For example , the Iraq War is not technically a war -- congress never declared war . And this isn't just a semantic detail , either . Declaring war used to mean that congress committed , the president committed , and all the citizens made sacrifices for the cause . Now we initiate military operations , never declare war in order to allow political wiggle room , cut everyone's taxes , tell them to go shopping , and call it a war anyway . Now that's redefining a word . Substituting a Jack for a Jill on a marriage license seems pretty minor in comparison to me .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The invasion of Iraq was a resumption of warfare that ended in a cease fire . It was not technically a new war requiring all the congressional steps . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not to derail this thread -- we can talk about this more in the Politics section -- but the last time the US Congress declared war was for WWII . So the conflict in Iraq is not in fact a resumption of a prior declared war .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're technically correct . However , the Gulf War was approved by Congress whether it was a declared war or not . The Iraq War was a continuation of the same conflict after a cease fire . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I understand the Bush administration has made this argument , but I don't think it has a whole lot of merit . It was a different presidential administration and the reasons for the conflict were different -- to repel the invasion of Kuwait . Not to mention that the same logical argument could be used to begin a fresh invasion of Vietnam or Korea .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I think not . Those conflicts ended in something other than a cease fire .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>178<br>S1 cites an article by a law professor which notes that opponents of gay marriage use many of the same arguments that were used by opponents of interracial marriage.  S2 claims she supports interracial marriage, provided it is heterosexual, and notes that she has not made inapplicable separate but equal arguments suggested by the analogy.   She purports to have gay friends and to be sympathetic to gay rights and civil unions but opposes gay marriage on the grounds that it does not meet her understanding of the word marriage.  S1 points out that she is using form over substance, and that the meaning or definition of marriage can change over time, noting that the public universally accepts and refers to the Irag War, despite the fact that the U.S. never declared war against Iraq, or Viet Nam or Korea either.  He suggests accepting an undeclared war as a war does less violence to the meaning of the term war than substituting a Jack for a Jill on a marriage license does to the term marriage.<br><b> key:   </b>1-5811_33_29__35_38_40_41_43_2 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Don't you think that in 1909 it was probably viewed mostly from a moral standpoint ? I don't think they saw it the same way they would see black people . They didn't even realize that ' homosexuality ' was any sort of innate thing . It was entirely behavioral to them . I tend to agree with the court , even given what you've said . I doubt for 1909 it was about prejudice and bigotry -- they genuinely felt it was wrong . The concept of gay marriage was completely foreign and unknown in 1909 . It wasn't even something they conceived of . I think the court is saying that they couldn't have been prejudiced against something they didn't even know of or conceive of .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Hogwash . It was once entirely moral to believe certain races were inferior , and that women had fewer rights than men . Treating the races and women as equal was not something even thought of by many . It was prejudice against gays then , and it still is today . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>This is not really true . It's a popular misconstruing of morality and history by proponents of modern ' rights ' movements , but it's not true . There's little historical backing to the idea that people believed oppressing black people was a right thing to do , as in , doing good . There were times they used an argument where religion was wrongly used to justify their behavior , but that's a different matter . If you firmly believe otherwise , I'd challenge you to show where people thought oppressing blacks was an example if doing good . The same goes for misogyny . Furthermore , it's beside the point anyway . We're talking about homosexuality . In 1909 , the only thing they really understood about the issue at hand was that some people engaged in sexual relations with people of their own gender . There were no articles about " homosexuality " as a trait , and certainly none about genetic causes . It was understood entirely from a behavioral standpoint , and therefore a moral standpoint . So it's not hogwash at all -- they really did view gay sex as immoral . If you don't think so , then you have a very poor grasp on history in this case .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This kind of morality is based on nothing but ignorance ( which you admit ) and prejudice . What kind of a basis is that for a so-called moral code ? So what if it involves behaviour ? Gay people have sex , develop relationships , and bond , just like everyone else , but in a way that reflects their gay sexuality . This does not mean people could not be prejudiced about the way gay people live . People were , and are so prejudiced . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>A better reverse analogy would have been to say " So then conversly I have the right to advocate that heterosexual relations are morally wrong " . Not heterosexuality , since it's not homosexuality ( as it's a state of being ) that religious people have a problem with . Heck , they often don't even recognize it . With that caveat , yes you are certainly free to advocate whatever you want to be morally wrong . ( And unlike the way some in your movement do , I won't call you a " bigot " for doing so ! ) It may have been based on " ignorance " , but I reject the notion it was based on prejudice ( and therefore I tend to agree with the 6 - 0 view of the justices here ) . The 1909 society had too little understanding of gay people to be prejudiced over in the first place . Remember , homosexuality was not understood as a state of being at that time . The term itself had not been around long and was not known to most people . And even to those it was known to , it was not known as a state of being . And there certainly was no social identity among gay people as a group -- how could prejudice have existed if there was nothing ( from their perspective ) to be prejudiced toward ?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Right . Provided gays don't live gay , but live straight , gays can be as gay as they want . As long as gays don't outwardly show what makes them different from straights , gays can be as gay as they want . It's bs . Also some may not recognize the existence of gay people or their gay lives , but that is putting one's head in the sand . Nonsense . People would widely and hatefully use the term " sodomite " to refer to gays . Before that the term was " molly " . Clearly there was an identity they were prejudiced towards . They were rounding up gays in areas they were known to attend , and putting them in prison . Read up on the trial of Oscar Wilde . Gays may have been forced underground , to a greater extent , but that does not mean they were not thought of . Gays were just not thought of in a nice way . Gays were purposely kept out of everything in society , when society didn't really think of gays as human too . That isn't prejudice ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Because they didn't approve of sodomy ! Do you not agree they didn't understand the concept of homosexuality ??? There was no social identity . When they were put on trial , it wasn't because they were gay ( which they had no concept of ) , it was because they had gay relations which society viewed as wrong ! No , here's where you don't get it -- it's not that " gays " ( there was no concept of that ) were purposely kept out of of everything , it's that people who had sodomy relationships were kept out of everything , because sodomy was viewed as wrong . They really did think it was wrong ! You are so determined to portray everything that has anything to do with gay relations possibly being wrong as prejudice and bigotry that you are close-minded about it .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>187<br>S1 and S2 are discussing attitudes toward homosexuality in 1909 as a result of an apparently recent 6-0 opinion of justices of a court which suggest to S1 that the justices agreed that in 1909 attitudes against homosexuality did not reflect prejudice or bigotry, but rather a more inherent moral aversion as a result of homosexuality having been less understood at the time.  S1 is of the opinion that these days it is generally accepted that being homosexual is a state of being, likely attributable to genetics, as opposed to aberrant behavior.  In 1909, he argues, the acts of homosexual sex or sodomy was what was persecuted and prosecuted, because the state of being an intrinsic homosexual was not studied or understood at the time. S2 is less forgiving and suggests homosexuality was well known in the Victorian era, citing the well publicized trials of Oscar Wilde, and that anti-gay attitudes has always been bigotry. S1 believes that in the past 'they' really did think that homosexuality was wrong, but that today 'we' know better.<br><br><b>worker_id </b>A2B2U8VNS9DK94<br>HITid:</b>  3Z3R5YC0P3N3RJ7OKJQT13Z4S9SFTX<br> <b>Status:</b>Approved<br><b> key:   </b>1-10073_119_44__120_124_127_129_130_131_132_133_134_6 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>I really wish that you would read my posts before commenting .

Please try to answer my question as to why my family is less deserving of government benefits than a heterosexual headed household . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Depends on your circumstances . They may be more deserving of government benefits than some heterosexual households . Do you need to marry your partner to recieve these benefits ? Are you more deserving than a single parent that deliberately has a clutch of children then moans because of lack of government support ?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>With full civil marriage equality , a whole host of benefits are brought about to strengthen my family such as survivors benefits for social security as just one example . Another example would be my husband , given that marriage equality were a reality , would automatically gain guardianship of our children were anything to happen to me . These of course are only a couple of the more than a thousand benefits marriage brings about . Certainly , you may argue that contracts drawn by a paid attorney or myself could reap these same benefits , but I do not understand what legitimate reason my family must jump through these hoops when heterosexual headed households are not required , asked or even expected to do the same . Two parents , two children , participating and supporting equally with our governments requirements as any other family , however receiving no reciprocation from the government to strengthen and protect my famly as It does heterosexual headed families . And no , I am certainly not more deserving than anyone else . We do not nor have not ever asked for a handout of any kind anymore than saying that a heterosexual headed household is asking for a handout when the parents are married . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>As you pointed out , it is only heterosexual couples that get to marry and reap the benefits from it . In a modern secular society there is no reason not to extend marriage to other forms of relationships . However just extending marriage to gay couples is not enough , it must be extended to all permutations of sexual relationships and society must look at sexual relationships that are otherwise banned . I cannot see why marriage should be granted to you but an incestuous relationship be illegal . Making homosexual sex legal is a far cry to making gay relationships officially equal to hetero ones . You are no ' better ' than two half brothers having a sexual relationship or a mother and son ..o r indeed a polygamous gay relationship ... it all deviates from the present definition of marriage . If you get it , everyone should get it .<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Would you agree that each form of proposed marriage arrangements would need to be argued on their own merits separately ? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Yes bit it should be considered in one package . I dont see why gays should have their relationships officialised ( is that a word ? ) and pull up the ladder so other types of relationships cannot follow . Before gay marriage is allowed then all types of sexual relationships should be considered . Lets face it , it would be far harder for people to accept a complete revolution in what we consider to be an appropriate relationship to become an official family than to just allow gays to do it ... using the very arguments that gays have to justify them officially marrying we can justify most other type of marriage . So to prohibit other forms of marriage would be tantamount to discrimination<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>185<br>S1 argues that allowing gay marriage would set a precedent that would be used to allow marriage for other forms of traditionally socially unacceptable intimate or sexual relationships, such as incest between half brothers or a mother and son, and/or polygamy.  S2 is in a 15 year male homosexual relationship and is anticipating twin children that are biologically related to him.  He challenges S1 to explain why he and his family should not be entitled to the many benefits associated with marriage, such as social security surviver status.  S1 provides a putative explanation by noting that his children are outsourced, meaning that one of the parents of the children is not part of the family intended to receive the benefits of marriage.  S1 also notes that others do not qualify, and likens S2 to a single mother who has many children and then complains about not enough help from the government.  S1 repeatedly compares gay relationships to other types of relationships which he considers to be devious in order to justify excluding gays from marriage rights.<br><b> key:   </b>1-3089_96_94__97_99_103_105_108_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>As I already stated Kerry expected to carry Ohio and got smashed there ........

First , to assume that the majority of people in Ohio were either silent about their views on same-sex marriage or on their choice for president is utter nonsense . They were absolutely as loud-mouthed about it as anyone else . Your implications that there is some " silent majority " imply a misunderstanding of the political battlefield , and I hope I have been able to clear it up . Next , although Bush won by a larger margin than Bill Clinton ( who you term " slick Willie " for no other reason than to anger and insult his supporters , I assume ? ) , this does not mean that Clinton did not win by a larger percentage . Remember that population increases over time , and there was a slightly higher voter turnout in this election due to its controversy . Even though Bush by a large number of voters compared to previous elections , he won by a marginal percentage due to the fact that the population of the US has increased . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Actually the population growth has nothing to do with the margin of victory ... I am talking about the votes President Bush won by and " Slick Willie " did not even get a 50 percent majority in either the 1992 and the 1996 election ......... He was very lucky that Perot ran in 1992 otherwise Bush would have defeated him ....... I am sure you have heard the term silent majority before ......... These are the people that when they vote make all the polls that the left wing media put out like the presidents approval rating is down or how bad the economy is or how bad the war in Iraq is going .......... If you think that morals and the gay marriage issue had no bearing in the president winning Ohio then you are living in a state of denial my friend ........<br><b> S2:2-  </b>In 2000 , Gore had 48.4% of the popular vote , while Bush had 47.9% . That gives Bush a negative . 5% in popular vote . In 2004 , Bush had 51% of the popular vote while Kerry had 48.1% . That gives Bush a victory by 2.9% of the popular vote . In comparison , Clinton in 1992 had 43% of the vote while Bush Sr. had 37.4% of the vote , which gives Clinton a win by 5.6% . In 1996 , Dole had 40.7% of the vote while Clinton had 49.2% of the vote , which gives Clinton the win by 8.5% . Clinton clearly had far greater victories than Bush ever did , the difference was that there was a competent third candidate running in both of Clinton's wins . http://mediamatters.org/items/200411150007 I have heard the term silent majority in the past , but it cannot refer to a majority which was not silent . The majority in Ohio ( and all of those other 11 states ) was in fact very , very vocal . Every poll was accurate . The term " silent majority " is not appropriate . I have no doubt that majority's desire to oppress the minority did play some factor in Bush's win in Ohio , but statistics suggest that it was a very small part . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Just for your information getting a majority of the vote means over 50 percent ........ Why was Kerry so sure he was going to win Ohio ? It is becasue the silent majority stood up big time ...........<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I did not say that this is not what the majority means . I was addressing the implications of your post , which is that Bush was more supported than Clinton . That is untrue . And why was Bush so sure he was going to win Michigan ? Actually Bush wasn't so sure he was going to win Michigan , and Kerry wasn't so sure he was going to win Ohio . Asking why Kerry was so sure he was going to win Ohio assumes the false premise that Kerry was so sure he was going to win it . In fact , he was not . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>President Bush did not win Michigan in 2000 and it would have been and upset if he won it 2004 but in every state that he lost in 2000 he picked up a bigger percent of the vote in 2004 ........

S2 doesn't believe there is a silent conservative majority and offers statistics to suggest that President Clinton was better supported by the electorate than President George W. Bush.

All the protesting in the world wouldn't have brought it about if the will of the people were not changing to make it happen . At the end of the day , any legislative movement needs the will of the people to be successful . It may not need a full majority in some cases , but it needs enough people on board . That's why legislation requires not only voting ( by legislature ) , but elected officials to do so as well . There was a process our country went through on those issues as whether or not they were legitimate in terms of the law -- it involved a national debate , protests , etc. Sometimes this process results in our country ( the people ) granting civil rights legislation , and sometimes it doesn't ( depending on whether it is deemed warranted ) . The process ( which will undoubtedly take years ) is going on right now in regards to gays . Time will tell what the result will be . Any form of legislation is a voting matter . That's the way our system works .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why is it that whenever this comes up you insist on conflating " the people voting on a law " with " the legislature voting on a law " or " the people electing politicians " ? Why can't you simply discuss the topic at hand ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>In what way do you feel it is not the issue at hand ? Matthew asked about voting on his civil rights and this is all part of the voting process .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>In exactly the way I just said . He asked about people voting on laws , not legislators voting on laws . Again , why can't you answer that question ; why do you feel that it's necessary to move the topic around ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Fair enough ; but regardless , the point still stands -- people voting on laws is indeed allowed under our system . ( Ballot initiatives . ) It is all part of the process I mentioned to Matthew of society determining its standards . If you have a beef with the people being able to work toward determining our society's standards ( through voting on such issues ) , then if I were you I'd take it up with the govt .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Or we could take it up here , like Matthew did , and discuss it . Or at least try to , and hope someone doesn't derail the conversation into irrelevant issues like how the legislature works . I will echo the point that several have made here . The idea of allowing the masses to determine civil rights is stupid and wrong . If a group's civil rights need protecting , then they need protecting from the very masses that are doing the voting . Ballot measures may be a legal process , but that doesn't prevent them from being stupid and wrong , now does it ? That's the point that's trying to be made here . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well , that's up to you . If you don't want to derail it , you don't have to . It seems to me that what is really happening in society with these ballot initiatives and other parts of the process is determining whether or not it is a civil right in the first place to give legal marriage to whatever group arrangement is in question . ( In this case , gays couples . ) That process has to take place ; it is just not feasible in our society to give marriage equality to any group of any arrangement that comes along demanding it until we determine for certain that it needs to be done . If society determines that same-sex arrangements of two people should suffice to redefine marriage for it to be included , then so be it . But that process has to be there in some form , realistically . If you are going to draw the line in terms of what can be voted on a ballot initiative or not , what authority determines that ? How are you going to determine where that line is drawn ? And you can't just arbitrarily say " when civil rights are being infringed " because that doesn't carry any legal weight -- it's opinion . Just saying it's " stupid " and " wrong " may be your point being made , but it's a point that doesn't offer any solutions .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You really are a piece of work . All you're saying here is that if society wants to be bigoted it should be allowed to be . Very libertarian of you , but I believe that if the power of the government can be used to fight evil and prejudice , it should . If wrong is happening , and the government can stop it , it should . You will of course claim that the government can't do anything , but history has proven that position wrong . The government has taken stands against biggotry before , and while it hasn't eradicated it , it has improved things . Gee , now I'm supposed to offer solutions before you even get what the point is ? I'm I allowed to use both hands while I type ?

S2 is of the opinion that society and government failure to recognize gay marriage and provide it equal protection is a civil rights violation being carried out against a minority group, implicitly suggesting that it should be protected under the Constitution by the Courts.  S1 on the other hand believes the issue is one that needs to spend time in the public awareness and consideration and be realized over time in the results of various political processes such as election results, initiatives in State legislatures and ballot initiatives.  S2 complains that this is obfuscation and an attempt by S1 to avoid the rights violation issue.  S2 disagrees and notes that just calling something a violation or stupid or wrong doesn't advance the process, and defies S1 to draw appropriate lines on where to draw the line, such as with regard to protection of other less acceptable group intimate relationships.

There are dozens of such precedents for not acknowledging licenses issued in other states . The 10th Amendment says that those rights not specifically given to the Feds belong to the State or individuals .

As for people changing , not only is that dubious anyway but not really proof of anything , there are alcoholics who recover and don't drink and that is definitely genetically influenced . You clearly have no real idea about the state of genetic research or how it works , we are nowhere near finding the purpose of everything . There doesn't appear to be one gene , but there is probably a combination that lead to a greater chance of being gay . @ Rev , Power of Attorney would be fine , but giving that there is already favouritism shown to some people , why should that favouritism be arteficailly restricted .

I don't think you know how genetics works in this instance . Or do you think that the method of upbringing they have is purely responisble ? I don't really see any real problem with polygamy itself , but it would have to be watched a little more carefully perhaps as the cultures that practise polygamy tend to be less focused on equality between sexs . As long as you make sure that the marriages are still volentary for both partners and that any person is fully able to leave if they want to then I can't really see the problem .

Never , I suppose . sigh <br><b>S1:2-  </b>How do you know he wouldn't support one if it were up for a vote ? I wonder how long it will be before folks like you stop claiming things that aren't happening ? I don't draw such conclusions . Sorry . . . accidentally misworded that . No " game " intended at all .

I've agreed with the gay rights stance on gay adoption . I've agreed that gays shouldn't have to face job and housing discrimination . I've agreed on numerous things . Those aren't instances of disagreement , but of agreement . Maybe I just haven't often found your comments agreeable .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes , I know . You may remember that I pointed out your opposition to the amendment to another poster just the other day . It's precisely the discrepancy between your stated beliefs and your constant arguments in opposition to them that lead people to believe that you do not , in fact , support gay rights . There are other possibilities , of course . Personally , I've latched onto the idea that you're paid to be here .

Can you describe the hand gestures that went with that ?<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>190<br>S1 is pointing out that by changing the definition of marriage in a proposed amendment it will affect traditional marriages. S1 quotes Colson and is attempting to make sure that Colson is not misrepresented. That Colson's belief is that the "traditional" household is the best scenario and does the best job in regards to keeping their children out of prison. He asserts that Colson feels the same regarding single parent households as well. That they are not "bad" but traditional households have the most success. S1 agrees with some of Colson's points but also agrees with many gay rights issues regarding discrimination, harassment, and adoption. S1 also points out that S2 seems to attack posters personally rather than the topics at hand. 
S2 feels that S1 continually draws conclusions about gay marriage from single parent household statistics. S2 also feels that S1 may be compensated financially for participation in the forum due to the discrepancy of S1 opposing the amendment and his stated beliefs but constantly bringing up arguments which are in opposition to those beliefs.<br><b> key:   </b>1-5672_6_5__7_13_15_16_17_20_2 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Actually , I think it's probably the most compelling argument I've read for the amendment . The be fair , I don't think the author is claiming there is a direct link between gay marriage and crime . He seems to be talking about overall effect on society and traditional family . But I'm still against the amendment ; amending the constitution over something like this is just not the right thing to do .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>" compelling argument " ? So do you believe the basis of what he's claiming ? And are you ready to debate it ? Because there is no " overall effect on society and traditional family " from gay marriage . The " traditional family " has been having its OWN problems , and has been in decline in these countries LONG BEFORE gay marriage ever was legalized . It's like a guy jumping out of an airplane , and he starts falling to the ground . Three seconds later gay marriage is legalized , and conservatives want to blame the fact that he's falling on gay marriage ... It makes no sense . There is no causality here ... Do straight people say , " Hey ! Gay marriage is legal . I don't want to get married now . " Do straight people say , " Hey ! Gay marriage is legal . I want to get a divorce now . " The " most compelling argument " lacks any semblance of sense . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes it does , because what is happening here is that ' family ' and ' marriage ' are being redefined . It is being broadened . People like Colson believe that marriage and family fits a certain criteria for it to truly be a marriage . That criteria IS traditional marriage , and if that changes that in Colson's eyes traditional marriage IS affected . I don't see how you can say that adopting gay marriage has no effect on that . I've heard Colson speak , BTW ; he speaks all over the country . I agree with some of what he's said and some I don't . He would say the same thing about kids raised in single parent homes ; but it's not that he's saying single parent homes are bad ; he's saying that homes with a mother and father are the best scenario . I think that's what he's saying here too . He's basically saying that by his observations of prisons , that traditional families do best in terms of raising children and them staying out of prison . Whether he's right or not is another matter , but I think it's important to at least represent the man's statements correctly here .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>LOL ! I don't see how you can say that it DOES have an effect on that . Tell me , for starters , WHAT effect it will happen . Will Colson get a divorce if gay marriage is legalized ? Will Colson wish he had never gotten married if gay marriage is legalized ? THEY are claiming SPECIFIC effects . NEGATIVE effects . Effects that should be PROVEN for them to be claimed ... HOW can they claim those SPECIFIC DETRIMENTAL effects from gay marriage onto OTHER PEOPLE's marriages ??? Where's the proof ? 1 ) Studies DO back-up the issue of " single vs dual parent house-holds " . And that is common sense . Two heads are better than one . Twice the capability to care . 2 ) Studies REFUTE the claims that dual heterosexual parents are better than dual gay parents . They aren't . Gay parents are just as good . The gender of the parents are irrelevant . The sexual orientation of the parents is irrelevant . Where did I misrepresent something Jyoshu ? He's claiming a SPECIFIC DETRIMENTAL EFFECT on families due to gay marriage . THAT is what I'm talking about . THAT is what I want proven , if he's going to claim it . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Easy . . . marriage in the defined sense will be changed . It will be more broadened . Where did he claim that ? All I see is that he feels that traditional families are better in terms of kids from them staying out of prison . It seemed to me you were representing this as someone ' blaming ' gay marriage for crime . If that's not what you meant , then fair enough .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Is that ALL the effect you are claiming then ? Are you then contradicting the previous article's claim that it will have a negative effect on heterosexual marriages ? Did you read the article Jyoshu ? Do you even know what we're talking about ? Again , did you READ the article Jyoshu ? Because if not , then why did you claim : " Actually , I think it's probably the most compelling argument I've read for the amendment . " For Jyoshu's edification : If you don't comprehend that is PRECISELY what the author IS doing , then I don't know what to tell you . It's there in black and white ! <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I never said I was compelled , or convinced by the article . I said it was probably the most compelling that I've seen . I see nothing in that quote blaming gay marriage for crime , directy OR even indirectly . You are making an inference --o ne that may or may NOT be intended . I would think if Colson's point was to lay blame for crime he would have simply said so . He didn't . Colson is simply opposing thge amendment because he believes that traditional families are best in terms of avoiding crime . I don't really agree either -- I think there are too many variables for that to automatically be the case .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Oh . I see . So if somebody said " Christianity causes cancer " , that would be a compelling argument for people to not be Christians . Right ? Give me a freakin ' break Jyoshu . READ the article . It's talking about gay marriage and the effects of it on society . It makes claims that : 1 ) Gay marriage will cause detriment to straight marriages . 2 ) Detriment to straight marriages , e.g. single parent families , yield greater instances of criminals . It's all right there . In plain English . I am making no " inference " . This IS what the author is saying . Then explain to me his next paragraph where he links LEGALIZATION of gay marriage to a decrease in " traditional families " . Can't you put two and two together ? And Colson is not " opposing " the amendment . He's SUPPORTING it . From the article : " This is just one reason that I am so passionately in favor of the Marriage Protection Amendment ... " Can't you even get THAT right ? Or are you so lost in obfuscation that you've confused yourself ?<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>210<br>S1 states that the author is not drawing a link between gay marriage and crime but to the overall effect on family and community. S1 is against the proposed amendment and does not believe that the constitution should be changed for this but feels the author has a compelling argument.That Colson is not saying gay marriage is responsible for increased crime.   S1 is saying that Colson is right when he says that broadening the defintion of marriage will impact "traditonal" marriage.

S2 feels this argument has no merit. That traditional marriage is not effected just because gay marriage is legal. One has no impact on the other. Straight marriage has been in decline for years long before gay marriage was legalized.  For Colson to state that traditional marriage will deteriorate is preposterous. S2 states that a household with two parents will obviously do better in raising their children because there is twice the capability to care for the child, but the sex of those two parents is irrelevant. S2 also states that Colson is saying that gay marriage yields more criminals because Colson links gay marriage to a decrease in traditional families, and decreases in traditional marriages result in more criminals.<br><b> key:   </b>1-10585_36_34__39_52_54_64_65_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Bert and Ernie are not gay !!

You want two male characters to be homosexual and take out the homosexual sex element just when it suits you . But two men could live together and be extremely close without being homosexual .. the homosexual element comes in at the genital fondling stage . You know it but cry ' dirty minds ' when this is stated . Pathetic and Miss piggy and kermit are interspecies but not portrayed as sexually active but gays like you want us to believe bert and ernie are .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No . You can portray some of the straight human characters as being married , without it being anything close to an adult sex film . In this case , some are just saying they would like two charcters who are both male to be married . Straight or gay can discuss the fact of marriage , without getting into sex act details or even touching the topic of sex acts .

One does not need to actually show or discuss the sexual acts of people when describing their sexuality ... you are the one that is stupidly suggesting this .

I didn't bring up religon in my argument . Jake did . So please don't specualte anything until you knwo what we're talking about . All laws are based upon morals . So it is based upon the morals of the country whcih happen to be predominantly Christian . England was one of many countries . There is no new family structure that didn't exist before this country . My definition of negative effect is that the puposes for which something is created is hindered or compromises . By changing standards there is a harm to it's integrity . Intregrity is compromised when it isn't stable . Soemthing that changes all teh time loses that integrity like John Kerry on his views . Things must remain consistent to be integral . This argument has a flaw . That when there is guaranteed religous freedomw then we dont ' have equal rights . Everyone has equal rights in terms of believing . However behavior is regualted by the government . Therefore we can do anyting in the name of religion until it violates behavior that is acceptable by society .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Fine , so what if the government said people are free to ' believe ' in God , but any sign of them putting their belief into practice , such as going to church or even just praying in private was illegal ? Would that be acceptable ? After all it is just regulating behaviourA , not belief ? Your comparisons are ludicrous . All of these situations involve non-consensual acts either through lack of knowledge or involvement of minors . You cannot compare that to consensual acts between adults . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That probably wouldn't be acceptable to most people but it would be legal and equal . They don't allow religious practices of polygamy , animal or human sacrifices , body mutilation , and many other religious practices . So then we should allow prostitution , polygamy , human trafficking , drug trafficking , gambling , drug distribution , and all other consensual acts .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But they obviously wouldn't be equal , because a significant proportion of the population would be restricted from worshipping how they want in a for that hurts nobody . These elements mostly have links to crime over and above the act itself , that justifies restrictions . Homosexuality doesn't . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The poeple would be equal . The religions would not . Look at our country . Almost all Christian beleifs are legal and no other non-Christians Churches have almost all their legal beleifs . That's it ? Crime ? That's it . The criminal link ? So if they criminalized homosexuality then it would be okay to ban gay marriage . Homosexuality has links to crime too . Sodomy is a crime . Define harm becaue homosexuality is harmful according to many .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>This is not equality . You are using the letter of the law to twist the purpose of the law , and even then doing it using very shaky logic . Equality is about general concepts , not specifics . It is equality to say ' everyone is has the same right to worship who they want ' , it is not equality to say ' everyone has the same right to worship who we tell them to ' . That is equality within an unequal system , which cannot be counted . Can you re-phrase , I don't follow . No . As I said , those have strong links to criminal activity irrespective of the act itself being a crime . For example drug use has noted links to theft , the same just cannot be said for homosexuality . No it isn't . And even if it was , that has nothing to do with homosexuality anyway . Physical or psychological injury or damage . Homosexuality is therefore in no way harmful . And I have serous doubts about the ' many ' who say it is . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Equality is treating every person the same . However it does not mean treating every person's behavior the same . It does not mean treat every organization the same either . Everyone has the same rights . NOt every religous practice , ideology , or behavior get the same treatment . Teh people determine what is in the public's interest to protect and ban . It basically only the Christian practices that are completely legal . Islamic polgamy and other religons don't have their practices recognized as often as christianity . Homosexuality has strong links to sodomy . Also prostitution is legal in Nevada so shoudl all states be forced to allow taht behavior ? Insome states adults cann have sex wiht 14 - 16 yr olds in some cases . Should other states recognize that too ? Most serial killers of men and young boys were homosexuals . Sodomy is a crime do you wnat me to post it ? gynocologist , Gi specialists , and colon specialist have all stated the effects homosexual related activites . Also there is a higher risk of disease transmission among homosexual men so much so they are not allowed to donate blood for 5 yrs from their last activity .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>180<br>S1: All laws are based on morals - Christian morals, as the U.S. was founded as a Christian country. By changing family standards by allowing gay marriage, the integrity of heterosexual marriage and family structure is no longer stable.  Prostitution, polygamy, human trafficking, gambling and drug distribution are all "consensual acts" as gay relations claim to be; should these be legalized too? Homosexuality is linked to crime, and many consider homosexuality to be harmful. Equality means treating everyone the same, but not treating every behavior the same. The people will determine what is in the public's best interest to protect and ban.

S2: What if belief in God was legally allowed, but worshiping in churches or even praying in private was illegal? A parallel to gay marriage - gay relations between two consenting adults is fine, but gay marriage is not. Acts like prostitution and drug trafficking are not equal exchanges, and are linked to crime; homosexuality is not. Equality means worshiping whomever you want, not what the majority believes is correct.<br><b> key:   </b>1-1281_132_130_1_134_135_136_138_139_140_141_142_12 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>I only have limited time to debate , so I have to pick my battles , so I'll pass on this one . I will make one point here . Heterosexual marriage is one of the most universal of all human institutions , found in almost all cultures ever existing . With a precedent like that , the question isn't , " Why Mr. Galton are you opposed to gay marriage ? " The question is how do you justify revolutionizing that ancient institution ? To me , heterosexual marriage is the Parthenon : ancient , beautiful , crumbling some of late , but it would be a tragedy to knock it down , clear it out , and put in a new building . You prove to me why that new building is so gotdamn necessary .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It is circular to say marriage has simply always been heterosexual , end of debate . No one is talking about knocking down marriage . Gay families want to enter into it , because they want their families strengthened and protected as heterosexual families have been strenghtened and protected . Gay families want into the institution because they want to be a positive influence on it , to support it and to shore it up , not because they desire to harm it . They are fighting to get into it , as some heterosexuals can't wait to get out of it . I can't see if it would make such a dramatic change just because the couple are the same sex . Also marriage in the U.S. and Canada falls under common-law . This is a " living law " meant to evolve with society , with much room for interpretation by judges . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You're gonna have to explain your circularity argument for us slow folks . And you're gonna have to back up your statement that gays as a group are really in their hearts conservatives , with a love of traditional institutions like marriage . I strongly suspect that you have some homosexuals who want the right to marriage for romantic reasons , some who want it for economic / legal privilege reasons , but also very many who want it so as to affirm that homosexuality is just as good as heterosexuality . It's the idea of we're just as good as you are , so we must be able to have everything you can have . For many , I suspect it is not a desire to adopt a more conservative lifestyle , but to make a point , and move the culture toward greater acceptance . This is a risky gamble to shove this down peoples ' throats as it may cause a backlash instead of greater legitimization of the lifestyle . Oh and you've got to be kidding me that gay marriage doesn't revolutionize marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Takes us back to where we started , assumes it absolutely must be and cannot be different or change . Sure , there are many who want acceptance from society , parents , friends , and that is a big reason why they marry , for gays or straights . If gays want their marriages to compete with heterosexual marriages , to prove gay marriages can be more successful , wouldn't that be good for the institution ? The old fashioned backlash argument is not a reason to not do something , and frankly is a little tired and worn-out in 2004 . Gays are just as good as you are . Is there a problem with gays believing and acting like they are just as good ? We don't have the strong sense of different gender roles we once had , so why is it such a revolutionary change ? I can't see that it has revolutionized the societies where it is in effect . It could have represented the next step in a very gradual continuation of acceptance that had been going on for a long time . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I am not arguing that heterosexual marriage must be as it has been or cannot be different . I am arguing that that revolutionizing such an important , ancient institution requires some heavy justification . People who have no respect for the past may not find my point compelling ; people who look to the past with deep respect and see in it old wisdom will find it compelling . I for one do not want to revolutionize an ancient institution I have great respect for , in order so the gay community can prove something . Tired argument ?! My god , how long have we been debating gay marriage ? Only four or five years ago in grad school , we were discussing how difficult it would be to see more and more rights to be extended to cohabiting gays couples , and we talked a little bit about gay civil unions . Marriage wasn't even on the damn table ! Homosexuality is an eccentricity ; in my mind it is not equal in value to heterosexuality . This is not an issue of how gays believe and act ; it is an issue of whether we are going to enshrine homosexual marriage as we do with heterosexual marriage . Gender , sexuality , and family organization are absolutely fundamental aspects of society -- always have been , always will be .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes , the hetero-only definition of marriage has been around a long time . However , simply because something is traditional does not make it just . Well that's how you see it because of your contempt for the gay community . You see it as " them " trying to step out of their lower place , or prove they are not lower than you and equal in value . Your last comment I've dealt with in this post , demonstrates that very well . Yes , the backlash threat is tired and boring . No one is listening anymore . Well , I remember people talking about marriage for gays and lesbians and their rights for much longer . Well , that says it all about where you are coming from . You believe homosexuals are human beings of lesser value . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I believe homosexual behavior is an eccentricity and not equal in value to heterosexuality . I was not referring to the value of persons ; I think homosexuals have as much intrinsic value as anyone else . I have contempt for no one . Your attempt to paint people who disagree with you as haters is unfair and a cheap debate tactic .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Homosexuals are persons who have homosexual behaviour . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>We are all sophisticated enough to separate behavior from person . I don't have to tell you that homosexuals are MUCH more than whom they prefer to sleep with .<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Yes , there is also homosexual orientation , which is part of the person's homosexual identity , and part of the person's homosexuality . The orientation leads to the behaviour .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>178<br>S1: Heterosexual marriage has existed in all cultures for a very long time. How can one justify revolutionizing an ancient institution? Some homosexuals want to marry for love or legal status, but many of them want to do it to prove that they are just as good as heterosexuals. Homosexuals want what heterosexuals have, and want to make the mainstream accept gay culture. Gay marriage is not a good enough justification for revolutionizing the institution of marriage. Homosexuality is an anomaly among man, is not equal with heterosexuality, and does not deserve marriage.
 
S2: Gays want to marry so that their families can have the strength and protection that the institution of marriage provides. They have no interest in harming the tradition of heterosexual marriage. Gays want to marry as badly as heterosexuals want not to be married. Living laws are meant to evolve with society. Homosexuals are just as good as heterosexuals. Other societies have legal gay marriage and no revolutions have occurred.

Indeed , the state and federal laws on the issue are specifically directed against gay people . It is woefully disingenuous of you to pretend otherwise . Another case of malicious disingenuity . Not even you can take it seriously with a straight face that these laws don't exist because gay people insist on equal rights , and homophobes want to deny them .

Marriage restrictions based on age , sex , species , number of , capacity , and perhaps a few other things .

There seems to be more that disagree with you but that is beside the point . The only way you get to equal protection meaning what you want it to mean is if you evolve the constitution to a new meaning .

After all , you folk take your right to marry the consenting adults you love for granted , but for some pig-headed reason , you think it's OK to deny gay Americans the same rights you have . And you think that's constitutional ? Steve , that's bigotry .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are borderline breaking the rules of the forum . That aside , did you want me to explain the meaning of equal protection or not ? If it makes you feel better I wouldn't think it was denial of equal protection if marriage was denied as two men or two women marrying each other . No , they can't marry each other . Not sure how that is protection but if it is then consider gays protected too . I'm not saying you should think the way I do but at least I am trying to answer your questions and respond to your points . All you seem to be doing is ignoring my posts and insulting me . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>yawn . But since that is the denial of equal rights , obviously you would be wrong to think that . Nope . A very disingenuous argument . Gay partnerships are NOT protected the same way as straight ones -- in many places , they are illegal . That would be obvious even to a blind man , but not to someone deliberately denying the facts . I am pointing out that your opinions are wrong . As to why you make the erroneous arguments you do , i can only surmise .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No because in that case everyone is still allowed to marry under what marriage means . so is a daughter and father relationship which was the topic at hand ... Why are they wrong ? Why can't you explain why denial of some things that aren't equal is ok and doesn't violate equal protection but with gay marriage it does ? It is this question that makes or breaks your entire argument .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>158<br>S1: The court upholds equal protections, but not for gays in federal and state laws. Equal protection under the law is for all. There is no evidence in the constitution that equal protection does not extend to homosexuals. For gays, not being able to marry is an obstacle to their pursuit of life, liberty and happiness. Gay partnerships are not protected in the same way that heterosexual marriages are. Denying gay marriage means denying an equal right. 

S2: Marriage is restricted by age, sex, species, number, capacity etc. If equal protection for gay marriage is desired, than these restrictions would have to be removed. The constitution would have to be changed. Gay marriage is not a part of the term "equal protection" in the constitution. The original understanding of the 14th amendment does not apply to gays unless they are denied marriage (as it is defined today) for being gay.</p><br><br><b>worker_id </b>A2FIK49SEYHD0C<br>HITid:</b>  3PUV2Q8SV446XDZBTR4ID9QXAPCDBU<br> <b>Status:</b>Rejected<br><b> key:   </b>1-9391_147_145_1_157_162_165_170_187_191_196_197_13 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>And rimming some dude's hairy bung is soooo appealing by comparison ?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What DVDs have you been watching , JP ?

At least that's what this article suggests : Opponents of gay marriage use many of the same arguments as foes of interracial relationships did before Loving v . Virginia outlawed state bans on interracial marriage in 1967 , said law professor Kim Forde-Mazrui at a talk sponsored by the Center for the Study of Race and Law and Lambda Law Alliance Sept . 30 . http://www.law.virginia.edu/home2002...fall/forde.htm<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This is not relevant to my argument at all . I have mentioned nothing about religious beliefs or bible-thumping protests against homosexuality . I did not bring interacial marriage into the discussion because it does not apply . I'm not against interacial marriage as long as there's a man and a woman involved . I did not bring the silly argument about water fountains into the discussion . Separate-but-equal does apply in the sense that records of legally recognized couples would separate married couples from same-sex couples but would not justify any inequalities regarding their rights and privileges . Hospital visitation , inheritance and other things could be afforded both . I'm wondering if those who insist on same-sex couples being called " married " are not acting somewhat from self-imposed shame ... like you want to hide the fact that you are gay . My argument has thusfar been limited to the requirement to redefine several other words if we redefine " marriage " . It has nothing to do with homophobia which , by the way , I do not suffer from . I have some friends that are gay and they know how I feel about the word " marriage " . We remain friends . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I accept your argument at face value , although I will say that I believe that the majority of people who argue against gay marriage do so for religious or homophobe reasons . ( Again , I'm not saying you fall into these categories . ) Words get redefined all the time , and some of them are just as important as the word ' marriage ' . For example , the Iraq War is not technically a war -- congress never declared war . And this isn't just a semantic detail , either . Declaring war used to mean that congress committed , the president committed , and all the citizens made sacrifices for the cause . Now we initiate military operations , never declare war in order to allow political wiggle room , cut everyone's taxes , tell them to go shopping , and call it a war anyway . Now that's redefining a word . Substituting a Jack for a Jill on a marriage license seems pretty minor in comparison to me .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The invasion of Iraq was a resumption of warfare that ended in a cease fire . It was not technically a new war requiring all the congressional steps . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not to derail this thread -- we can talk about this more in the Politics section -- but the last time the US Congress declared war was for WWII . So the conflict in Iraq is not in fact a resumption of a prior declared war .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're technically correct . However , the Gulf War was approved by Congress whether it was a declared war or not . The Iraq War was a continuation of the same conflict after a cease fire . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I understand the Bush administration has made this argument , but I don't think it has a whole lot of merit . It was a different presidential administration and the reasons for the conflict were different -- to repel the invasion of Kuwait . Not to mention that the same logical argument could be used to begin a fresh invasion of Vietnam or Korea .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I think not . Those conflicts ended in something other than a cease fire .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>191<br>S1 Links fight for gay marriage to earlier fight for interracial marriage legality.

I don't think they saw it the same way they would see black people . They didn't even realize that ' homosexuality ' was any sort of innate thing . It was entirely behavioral to them . I tend to agree with the court , even given what you've said . I doubt for 1909 it was about prejudice and bigotry -- they genuinely felt it was wrong . The concept of gay marriage was completely foreign and unknown in 1909 . It wasn't even something they conceived of . I think the court is saying that they couldn't have been prejudiced against something they didn't even know of or conceive of .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Hogwash . It was once entirely moral to believe certain races were inferior , and that women had fewer rights than men . Treating the races and women as equal was not something even thought of by many . It was prejudice against gays then , and it still is today . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>This is not really true . It's a popular misconstruing of morality and history by proponents of modern ' rights ' movements , but it's not true . There's little historical backing to the idea that people believed oppressing black people was a right thing to do , as in , doing good . There were times they used an argument where religion was wrongly used to justify their behavior , but that's a different matter . If you firmly believe otherwise , I'd challenge you to show where people thought oppressing blacks was an example if doing good . The same goes for misogyny . Furthermore , it's beside the point anyway . We're talking about homosexuality . In 1909 , the only thing they really understood about the issue at hand was that some people engaged in sexual relations with people of their own gender . There were no articles about " homosexuality " as a trait , and certainly none about genetic causes . It was understood entirely from a behavioral standpoint , and therefore a moral standpoint . So it's not hogwash at all -- they really did view gay sex as immoral . If you don't think so , then you have a very poor grasp on history in this case .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This kind of morality is based on nothing but ignorance ( which you admit ) and prejudice . What kind of a basis is that for a so-called moral code ? So what if it involves behaviour ? Gay people have sex , develop relationships , and bond , just like everyone else , but in a way that reflects their gay sexuality . This does not mean people could not be prejudiced about the way gay people live . People were , and are so prejudiced . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>A better reverse analogy would have been to say " So then conversly I have the right to advocate that heterosexual relations are morally wrong " . Not heterosexuality , since it's not homosexuality ( as it's a state of being ) that religious people have a problem with . Heck , they often don't even recognize it . With that caveat , yes you are certainly free to advocate whatever you want to be morally wrong . ( And unlike the way some in your movement do , I won't call you a " bigot " for doing so ! ) It may have been based on " ignorance " , but I reject the notion it was based on prejudice ( and therefore I tend to agree with the 6 - 0 view of the justices here ) . The 1909 society had too little understanding of gay people to be prejudiced over in the first place . Remember , homosexuality was not understood as a state of being at that time . The term itself had not been around long and was not known to most people . And even to those it was known to , it was not known as a state of being . And there certainly was no social identity among gay people as a group -- how could prejudice have existed if there was nothing ( from their perspective ) to be prejudiced toward ?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Right . Provided gays don't live gay , but live straight , gays can be as gay as they want . As long as gays don't outwardly show what makes them different from straights , gays can be as gay as they want . It's bs . Also some may not recognize the existence of gay people or their gay lives , but that is putting one's head in the sand . Nonsense . People would widely and hatefully use the term " sodomite " to refer to gays . Before that the term was " molly " . Clearly there was an identity they were prejudiced towards . They were rounding up gays in areas they were known to attend , and putting them in prison . Read up on the trial of Oscar Wilde . Gays may have been forced underground , to a greater extent , but that does not mean they were not thought of . Gays were just not thought of in a nice way . Gays were purposely kept out of everything in society , when society didn't really think of gays as human too . That isn't prejudice ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Because they didn't approve of sodomy ! Do you not agree they didn't understand the concept of homosexuality ??? There was no social identity . When they were put on trial , it wasn't because they were gay ( which they had no concept of ) , it was because they had gay relations which society viewed as wrong ! No , here's where you don't get it -- it's not that " gays " ( there was no concept of that ) were purposely kept out of of everything , it's that people who had sodomy relationships were kept out of everything , because sodomy was viewed as wrong . They really did think it was wrong ! You are so determined to portray everything that has anything to do with gay relations possibly being wrong as prejudice and bigotry that you are close-minded about it .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>180<br>S1 Claims that gay marriage wasn't opposed as such in 1909 because it was thought of as a behavioral issue and the idea of marriage wasn't even linked to homosexuality. S2 Claims it was and is prejudice and references earlier rules on legal rights of minorities and women. S1 Claims linking views on homosexuality, race rights and misogyny in 1909 invalid because there was no discussion in the literature of the time about being gay as genetic, instead it was behavioral and thought immoral. S2 Claims that gays do the same as straights in regards to relationships and sex and so opposition is prejudice not morality. S1 Claims that in 1909 being gay wasn't thought of as a way of being so it couldn't be prejudice to oppose it.

Now , THERE'S some revisionist history . It was a Republican Congress that first balanced the budget after gaining control of the HR for the first time in 40 years .

You want to impose your personal and religious morality on everyone else , by giving those who don't share your beliefs , fewer rights .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The manipulation came when gays married in Mass attempted to use the " Full Faith and Credit Clause as a means to force the acceptance of gay marriage on te rest of the contry . The Full Faith and Credit Clause was never intended , nor does it apply to marriage laws . The FFaCC holds for court judgements , but not licenses . It's no different that having a driver's license in MI at age 16 , but not being allowed to drive in NY until you're 18 , even if you hold a valid MI driver's license . There are dozens of such precedents for not acknowledging licenses issued in other states . The 10th Amendment says that those rights not specifically given to the Feds belong to the State or individuals . In many states , the people have decided whether or not gay marriage should be allowed and have exercised their 10th Amendment right to self-govern .

I haven't been argued that homosexuality is right according to religious beleifs , but more often that your religious beleifs should have nothing to do with my life . Acceptance of homosexuality effecting plate tectonics ? Time to come back to the real world , even if it is true , why should you worship a being that is quite happy to destroy homes and kill people for becoming more tolerant but is quite happy with the famine and AIDS situation and doesn't get involved with politics ? The constitution is not magic , it has been changed because enough people wanted it done , if the majority wants to ignore or change a part of the consititution it will do .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>First opff Jake started this rel ; igious topic . Reread the posts I'm only refuting his assertions . I did not say homosexuality is the cause of anything religious only citing support against Jake's comments . Don't ever try to assume you know God's mentality . Most parents love their children but they raise them according to how they feel is best . According tro what they know . Why are some parents motivator and others discipliners ? That's my popint if the majority want it they will do it . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And I refute your refutations . You implied that the Earthquakes were not a natural thing and dinviinly caused Even if there is a god , any ' loving parent ' that kills some of its children to make a point , when they are fully capable of just changing the issue anyway is hardly deserving of worship . As for people changing , not only is that dubious anyway but not really proof of anything , there are alcoholics who recover and don't drink and that is definitely genetically influenced . You clearly have no real idea about the state of genetic research or how it works , we are nowhere near finding the purpose of everything . There doesn't appear to be one gene , but there is probably a combination that lead to a greater chance of being gay . @ Rev , Power of Attorney would be fine , but giving that there is already favouritism shown to some people , why should that favouritism be arteficailly restricted . In the interest of fairness it seems a lot easy to recognise a few more people in an existing group that abolishing it . Also not everyone shares your view on the purpose and role of a government<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No you refute your inferences No I didn't Who said God killed them ? For someoen that claims there is no God it's amazing how you're the expert now on the nature of God . i agree there is a disposition but that doesn't mean that they are genetically confined as the alcoholic isn't . So why draw the line at homosexuals ? Why not polygamists ? Why do homosexuals deserve the right and polygamists don't ? What merits do homosexuality bring that polygamy doesn't ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So that little peice of geological trivia was just that , and had nothing to do with this debate or any points whatsoever ? Perhaps some people are capable of thinking from another's point of view , if God is a loving parent I can't see how you can justify the view that anything lethal can be used as a punishment . I don't think you know how genetics works in this instance . Or do you think that the method of upbringing they have is purely responisble ? I don't really see any real problem with polygamy itself , but it would have to be watched a little more carefully perhaps as the cultures that practise polygamy tend to be less focused on equality between sexs . As long as you make sure that the marriages are still volentary for both partners and that any person is fully able to leave if they want to then I can't really see the problem . However it is a lot more complicated if you are looking from the benefits point of view with respect to inheritance and other aspects ( child support and suchlike ) but these are realitively minor points that would just have to be worked out if this type of marriage was to be recognised<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>156<br>S1 claims that abortions and unwed couples have nothing to do with wars and earthquakes frequencies.

I didn't bring up religon in my argument . Jake did . So please don't specualte anything until you knwo what we're talking about . All laws are based upon morals . So it is based upon the morals of the country whcih happen to be predominantly Christian . England was one of many countries . There is no new family structure that didn't exist before this country . My definition of negative effect is that the puposes for which something is created is hindered or compromises . By changing standards there is a harm to it's integrity . Intregrity is compromised when it isn't stable . Soemthing that changes all teh time loses that integrity like John Kerry on his views . Things must remain consistent to be integral . This argument has a flaw . That when there is guaranteed religous freedomw then we dont ' have equal rights . Everyone has equal rights in terms of believing . However behavior is regualted by the government . Therefore we can do anyting in the name of religion until it violates behavior that is acceptable by society .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Fine , so what if the government said people are free to ' believe ' in God , but any sign of them putting their belief into practice , such as going to church or even just praying in private was illegal ? Would that be acceptable ? After all it is just regulating behaviourA , not belief ? Your comparisons are ludicrous . All of these situations involve non-consensual acts either through lack of knowledge or involvement of minors . You cannot compare that to consensual acts between adults . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That probably wouldn't be acceptable to most people but it would be legal and equal . They don't allow religious practices of polygamy , animal or human sacrifices , body mutilation , and many other religious practices . So then we should allow prostitution , polygamy , human trafficking , drug trafficking , gambling , drug distribution , and all other consensual acts .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But they obviously wouldn't be equal , because a significant proportion of the population would be restricted from worshipping how they want in a for that hurts nobody . These elements mostly have links to crime over and above the act itself , that justifies restrictions . Homosexuality doesn't . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The poeple would be equal . The religions would not . Look at our country . Almost all Christian beleifs are legal and no other non-Christians Churches have almost all their legal beleifs . That's it ? Crime ? That's it . The criminal link ? So if they criminalized homosexuality then it would be okay to ban gay marriage . Homosexuality has links to crime too . Sodomy is a crime . Define harm becaue homosexuality is harmful according to many .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>This is not equality . You are using the letter of the law to twist the purpose of the law , and even then doing it using very shaky logic . Equality is about general concepts , not specifics . It is equality to say ' everyone is has the same right to worship who they want ' , it is not equality to say ' everyone has the same right to worship who we tell them to ' . That is equality within an unequal system , which cannot be counted . Can you re-phrase , I don't follow . No . As I said , those have strong links to criminal activity irrespective of the act itself being a crime . For example drug use has noted links to theft , the same just cannot be said for homosexuality . No it isn't . And even if it was , that has nothing to do with homosexuality anyway . Physical or psychological injury or damage . Homosexuality is therefore in no way harmful . And I have serous doubts about the ' many ' who say it is . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Equality is treating every person the same . However it does not mean treating every person's behavior the same . It does not mean treat every organization the same either . Everyone has the same rights . NOt every religous practice , ideology , or behavior get the same treatment . Teh people determine what is in the public's interest to protect and ban . It basically only the Christian practices that are completely legal . Islamic polgamy and other religons don't have their practices recognized as often as christianity . Homosexuality has strong links to sodomy . Also prostitution is legal in Nevada so shoudl all states be forced to allow taht behavior ? Insome states adults cann have sex wiht 14 - 16 yr olds in some cases . Should other states recognize that too ? Most serial killers of men and young boys were homosexuals . Sodomy is a crime do you wnat me to post it ? gynocologist , Gi specialists , and colon specialist have all stated the effects homosexual related activites .

I will make one point here . Heterosexual marriage is one of the most universal of all human institutions , found in almost all cultures ever existing . With a precedent like that , the question isn't , " Why Mr. Galton are you opposed to gay marriage ? " The question is how do you justify revolutionizing that ancient institution ? To me , heterosexual marriage is the Parthenon : ancient , beautiful , crumbling some of late , but it would be a tragedy to knock it down , clear it out , and put in a new building . You prove to me why that new building is so gotdamn necessary .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It is circular to say marriage has simply always been heterosexual , end of debate . No one is talking about knocking down marriage . Gay families want to enter into it , because they want their families strengthened and protected as heterosexual families have been strenghtened and protected . Gay families want into the institution because they want to be a positive influence on it , to support it and to shore it up , not because they desire to harm it . They are fighting to get into it , as some heterosexuals can't wait to get out of it . I can't see if it would make such a dramatic change just because the couple are the same sex . Also marriage in the U.S. and Canada falls under common-law . This is a " living law " meant to evolve with society , with much room for interpretation by judges . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You're gonna have to explain your circularity argument for us slow folks . And you're gonna have to back up your statement that gays as a group are really in their hearts conservatives , with a love of traditional institutions like marriage . I strongly suspect that you have some homosexuals who want the right to marriage for romantic reasons , some who want it for economic / legal privilege reasons , but also very many who want it so as to affirm that homosexuality is just as good as heterosexuality . It's the idea of we're just as good as you are , so we must be able to have everything you can have . For many , I suspect it is not a desire to adopt a more conservative lifestyle , but to make a point , and move the culture toward greater acceptance . This is a risky gamble to shove this down peoples ' throats as it may cause a backlash instead of greater legitimization of the lifestyle . Oh and you've got to be kidding me that gay marriage doesn't revolutionize marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Takes us back to where we started , assumes it absolutely must be and cannot be different or change . Sure , there are many who want acceptance from society , parents , friends , and that is a big reason why they marry , for gays or straights . If gays want their marriages to compete with heterosexual marriages , to prove gay marriages can be more successful , wouldn't that be good for the institution ? The old fashioned backlash argument is not a reason to not do something , and frankly is a little tired and worn-out in 2004 . Gays are just as good as you are . Is there a problem with gays believing and acting like they are just as good ? We don't have the strong sense of different gender roles we once had , so why is it such a revolutionary change ? I can't see that it has revolutionized the societies where it is in effect . It could have represented the next step in a very gradual continuation of acceptance that had been going on for a long time . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I am not arguing that heterosexual marriage must be as it has been or cannot be different . I am arguing that that revolutionizing such an important , ancient institution requires some heavy justification . People who have no respect for the past may not find my point compelling ; people who look to the past with deep respect and see in it old wisdom will find it compelling . I for one do not want to revolutionize an ancient institution I have great respect for , in order so the gay community can prove something . Tired argument ?! My god , how long have we been debating gay marriage ? Only four or five years ago in grad school , we were discussing how difficult it would be to see more and more rights to be extended to cohabiting gays couples , and we talked a little bit about gay civil unions . Marriage wasn't even on the damn table ! Homosexuality is an eccentricity ; in my mind it is not equal in value to heterosexuality . This is not an issue of how gays believe and act ; it is an issue of whether we are going to enshrine homosexual marriage as we do with heterosexual marriage . Gender , sexuality , and family organization are absolutely fundamental aspects of society -- always have been , always will be .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes , the hetero-only definition of marriage has been around a long time . However , simply because something is traditional does not make it just . Well that's how you see it because of your contempt for the gay community . You see it as " them " trying to step out of their lower place , or prove they are not lower than you and equal in value . Your last comment I've dealt with in this post , demonstrates that very well . Yes , the backlash threat is tired and boring . No one is listening anymore . Well , I remember people talking about marriage for gays and lesbians and their rights for much longer . Well , that says it all about where you are coming from . You believe homosexuals are human beings of lesser value . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I believe homosexual behavior is an eccentricity and not equal in value to heterosexuality . I was not referring to the value of persons ; I think homosexuals have as much intrinsic value as anyone else . I have contempt for no one . Your attempt to paint people who disagree with you as haters is unfair and a cheap debate tactic .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Homosexuals are persons who have homosexual behaviour . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>We are all sophisticated enough to separate behavior from person . I don't have to tell you that homosexuals are MUCH more than whom they prefer to sleep with .<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Yes , there is also homosexual orientation , which is part of the person's homosexual identity , and part of the person's homosexuality . The orientation leads to the behaviour .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>189<br>S1 Compares heterosexual marriage Parthenon, asks why it should be torn down.

Indeed , the state and federal laws on the issue are specifically directed against gay people . It is woefully disingenuous of you to pretend otherwise . Another case of malicious disingenuity . Not even you can take it seriously with a straight face that these laws don't exist because gay people insist on equal rights , and homophobes want to deny them .

I certainly can and there is nothing saying they can't within the restrictions by the law . Perhaps you don't . Let's look at marriage as an example . Marriage restrictions based on age , sex , species , number of , capacity , and perhaps a few other things . If you want " equal protection " the way you define it then all of these restrictions ( short of capacity ) would have to be removed . Is this what you mean by equal protection ? There seems to be more that disagree with you but that is beside the point . The only way you get to equal protection meaning what you want it to mean is if you evolve the constitution to a new meaning .

Do you have any empathy ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>In answer to your first question as it stands , No , it happens all the time . If society had set up the institution of marriage as a gay one since OG was in his cave then I would certainly try and lobby otherwise if I disagreed . If the lobbying failed and the rest of Society said we keep things the way we want them however sorry they may feel , then I would clearly have to abide by that , although lobbying would continue . However castigating people because of their beliefs or stating they shouldn't have them , must be wrong . Otherwise I could claim that you are not entitled to your beliefs which clearly you are<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That is not what I asked you . Do you really lack any empathy ? I didn't ask you what you would do I asked you how you would feel . Let's try again How would you feel if the world was the other way around ?

For the record I do not believe I have the right to tell anyone who they should be allowed to marry but many of those that are anti same sex marriage think that they have a right to tell people who they should be allowed to marry .

Second yes I would probably feel sad if I wasn't allowed to marry the person I was with BUT I would be with the person I love in any event . Thirdly , as marriage is looked on as a public institution then Society as a whole is entitled to lay down the rules relating to it just as Society lays down the rules and laws by which we live .

So if I use your belief on another topic , say slavery , you then would conclude that slavery was neither cruel nore injust 1 since it was a legal and traditional activity practiced since OG was in the cave 2 slaves should not think it was cruel and unjust because they had no legal rights and standing and thus was not cruel and unjust since they were slaves .

We can only advance in civilisation ( I hope ) but lobbying publicity etc can help people's awareness in bring matters before their eyes to decide on .

Love and reproduction are implied . The legal meaning of marriage is , in most States , a contract between two people who are not under the age of consent , of different genders , of the same species , not closely related and who are not already married . Homosexuals are not a part of the traditional or cultural meaning of marriage . In order to be included , the meaning of marriage would have to change . The catch-22 is that homosexual couples want to be included in the current meaning of marriage , but what gives marriage meaning specifically excludes homosexual couples .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That's your definition . It is certainly not my definition . You don't speak for all of society . I personally define marriage as a union of two people who love one another and wish to make a commitment to one another . If marriage is about reproduction , why does nobody bat an eye when a 65 year old woman marries a 68 year old man ? If you believe marriage is " formalization of a mating pair " , and " reproduction is implied " , doesn't this cheapen the institution of marriage in your eyes ? Obviously , they are not getting married to start a family ... perhaps love is what is important ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Mating pairs exist with or without marriage , and have no legal connection with marriage ( since , legally , it doesn't matter if the two people even like one another , or ever intend on consumating said marriage ) . The only connection between a mating couple and marriage is the connection made on a cultural level . So , logically , the cultural meaning of marriage would be the purpose of a mating couple . While ' purpose ' can mean different things , in this context I daresay most would refer to the evolutionary purpose of a mating couple : reproduction . Love is implied because love brings the couple together for that purpose . While legally a 27 yr old marrying a 70 yr old sugar daddy is not a problem , culturally speaking this marriage is not as meaningful as one that is in-line with the evolutionary purpose I outlined above . You can point to exceptions all you want , but all it does is outline the difference between the legal meaning and the cultural meaning of marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Who gave you the power to decide what is culturally meaningful ? And more importantly , should we legally define marriage based on your perception of " cultural meaning " ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No , you should legally define it any damn way you can get away with . The cultural definition comes from observation .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But who get's to decide that legal definition ... that's the point . In this specific case in point , the anti crowd wishes to limit the rights of others simply based on personally held beliefs ... when no harm is presented to any party involved . In a case such as this , I feel strongly that without a specific vector of harm , we must as a civilized society rule in favor of providing equal rights rather than limit rights of a minority . I think these 4 pages thus far make clear that cultural definition is based on subjective obeservation and personal opinion formed via that observation . Clearly , I and many others here do not share your cultural definition . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>In America the people generally vote on issues , or elect representatives to enact laws . That's how you change the legal definitions . This isn't about equality , snakespit . The title of this thread shows that :P In all seriousness , though , it really isn't about equality . I don't think you have a rational basis upon which to dispute that observation . It is an indisputible fact that the cultural view that has dominated this country ( as evidenced by the definition of marriage ) generally follows evolutionarily sound logic : monogamous pair bonding outside of close familial ties . Inclusion of homosexuals would obviously change that .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>186<br>S1 States that the current definition of marriage specifically excludes homosexuals because the current definition is "two people that are not underage, or opposite genders, same species, not closely related and not already married" and that gays want to be married under current definition. Believes that ability to reproduce is implied in definition. S2 Claims S1's definition isn't only possible, refers to lack of reproductive abilities of an elderly person and a younger person marrying. S1 Refers to differences between cultural definitions of marriage and mating pairs or legal definitions of marriage. S2 Ask who agve S1 right to define cultural meanings. S1 Claims that cultural meaning comes from observation and that legal definition can be decided any way. S2 Asks who gets to make that legal definition. Claims that those that oppose gay marriage are opposing something that harms no one and are trying to limit other's actions. S1 States that in America people vote on laws or those that make them and that is who gets to determine legality of different marriage concepts.<br><b> key:   </b>1-10349_72_70__75_82_83_84_85_86_87_88_89_90_94_95_99_4 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>I'm speaking of everyone who lives in the society ... it's implicit that we agree to live by the laws of that society :P A social contract , if you will .

If the meaning were solely based upon religion then it would be an arbitrary custom . But it's based upon biology , which isn't an arbitrary difference .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>As long as 70 year olds are allowed to marry then you have lost that arguement . What is the difference between a couple of 70 year olds and a gay couple ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>A heterosexual bond's ultimate causation is to facilitate reproduction . Pointing out a particular couple who does not reproduce would not change that fact :P Marriage is a formalization of that bond . Rofl , you would still have a problem with that , don't lie . After all , OMG THEY HAVE BENEFITS YOU DON'T GET OMG . And that's unconstitutional isn't it , Matthew S. At least according to your flawed reasoning .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I want equality . The lack of is what I find unconstitutional and unjust . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Surely , and in your little scenario married people still have benefits that you don't get . So it's a lie that you'd ' be ok with that ' since you've been pretty loudly outspoken about that very point . That if anyone has benefits you don't get then it must be unconstitutional .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I have had this idea for years . http://www.4forums.com/political/gay...man-woman.html <br><b>S1:4-  </b>lol , so what ? You've also been braying about how if some people have benefits that you don't have access to ( and in your scenario it would be much less possible for you to get those benefits ) then it must be unconstitutional . So either you're a hypocrite or you don't actually pay attention to what you say .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I actually have a marriage license . The same license that everyone gets from the state of Iowa , yet my license is not recognized by either the federal government or the state of Michigan , how is that not unconstitutional ? Why are those the only two options ? I want equality and I don't care how it comes about . If my rules where applied to marriage , yes it would suck , but I would then be treated equally to those heteros , who currently do not breed , can not breed , or choose not to breed , yet can get a marriage license at the drop of a hat and have it recognized . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Because the Constitution does not require them to :P It has been long established that States have authority over marriage definitions . Because , gasp , they get marriage benefits while you do not ! Are you saying it's equal for some people to get marriage benefits but single people do not ?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>What is it about the same piece of paper you do not understand ? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>The reason you have that paper is the same reason other States don't have to honor it . That reason is : States decide for themselves what constitutes a marriage . I'm still interested in the fact that you're ok with some people getting marriage benefits and others not getting them .<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Once again the state of Iowa issues one piece of paper to everyone . What part of that do you not understand ? The other states and the federal government must recognize all or none . If marriage is to be about breeders and breeding children , and my rules are adopted by the state then yes I am alright . If my rules were adopted then almost no one would get married , and those who get married have to breed if they don't they are no longer married . They have to have 3 witnesses to their act of breeding , along with a video of the event stored in the public records of the county were they live . <br><b>S1:7-  </b>I understand every part of that . Nothing makes States recognize all or none , Matthew S. In fact , it's been true since the ratification that States establish their own marriage laws ... and anyone in the State is subject to those marriage laws . It doesn't matter what other States say about your marriage because you're not in those States . No you aren't because some people would have marriage benefits but you will not . You've been very vocal that if anyone gets marriage benefits when you do not then it must be unconstitutional . Are you now saying that it's perfectly Constitutional for only some people to get marriage benefits ? And you're wrong , of course . People would get married . Besides ' having witnesses ' ( which is for the signing of the contract not the execution , duh ) , a lifelong relationship with children is the ideal marriage . It's what people hope to have .<br><b> S2:7-  </b>And why would gay people be any different ? What we have is you saying to me that I can't get married because you have some belief against it . I wish I could say to you , you can't go to that place or do that thing because I have a belief against you doing so . <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Saying heterosexuals are the same as homosexuals is political fiction . At some point you'll have to realize that biological differences exist and sometimes that has ramifications for how you're treated . It's a bit like being left-handed ; the world is sort of built around people being rightys . Sorry . You're sitting there demanding the world be changed to suit leftys as if it is your due , while at the same time casually denying that anything was made for rightys in the first place .

So do you believe the basis of what he's claiming ? And are you ready to debate it ? Because there is no " overall effect on society and traditional family " from gay marriage . The " traditional family " has been having its OWN problems , and has been in decline in these countries LONG BEFORE gay marriage ever was legalized . It's like a guy jumping out of an airplane , and he starts falling to the ground . Three seconds later gay marriage is legalized , and conservatives want to blame the fact that he's falling on gay marriage ... It makes no sense . There is no causality here ... Do straight people say , " Hey ! Gay marriage is legal . I don't want to get married now . " Do straight people say , " Hey ! Gay marriage is legal . I want to get a divorce now .

Will Colson wish he had never gotten married if gay marriage is legalized ? THEY are claiming SPECIFIC effects . NEGATIVE effects . Effects that should be PROVEN for them to be claimed ... HOW can they claim those SPECIFIC DETRIMENTAL effects from gay marriage onto OTHER PEOPLE's marriages ??? Where's the proof ? 1 ) Studies DO back-up the issue of " single vs dual parent house-holds " . And that is common sense . Two heads are better than one . Twice the capability to care . 2 ) Studies REFUTE the claims that dual heterosexual parents are better than dual gay parents . They aren't . Gay parents are just as good . The gender of the parents are irrelevant . The sexual orientation of the parents is irrelevant . Where did I misrepresent something Jyoshu ?

THAT is what I want proven , if he's going to claim it . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Easy . . . marriage in the defined sense will be changed . It will be more broadened . Where did he claim that ?

If that's not what you meant , then fair enough .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Is that ALL the effect you are claiming then ? Are you then contradicting the previous article's claim that it will have a negative effect on heterosexual marriages ? Did you read the article Jyoshu ? Do you even know what we're talking about ?

I see nothing in that quote blaming gay marriage for crime , directy OR even indirectly . You are making an inference --o ne that may or may NOT be intended . I would think if Colson's point was to lay blame for crime he would have simply said so . He didn't . Colson is simply opposing thge amendment because he believes that traditional families are best in terms of avoiding crime . I don't really agree either -- I think there are too many variables for that to automatically be the case .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Oh . I see . So if somebody said " Christianity causes cancer " , that would be a compelling argument for people to not be Christians . Right ? Give me a freakin ' break Jyoshu . READ the article .

It makes claims that : 1 ) Gay marriage will cause detriment to straight marriages . 2 ) Detriment to straight marriages , e.g. single parent families , yield greater instances of criminals . It's all right there . In plain English . I am making no " inference " . This IS what the author is saying . Then explain to me his next paragraph where he links LEGALIZATION of gay marriage to a decrease in " traditional families " . Can't you put two and two together ? And Colson is not " opposing " the amendment . He's SUPPORTING it . From the article : " This is just one reason that I am so passionately in favor of the Marriage Protection Amendment ...

I didn't bring up religon in my argument . Jake did . So please don't specualte anything until you knwo what we're talking about . All laws are based upon morals . So it is based upon the morals of the country whcih happen to be predominantly Christian . England was one of many countries . There is no new family structure that didn't exist before this country . My definition of negative effect is that the puposes for which something is created is hindered or compromises . By changing standards there is a harm to it's integrity . Intregrity is compromised when it isn't stable . Soemthing that changes all teh time loses that integrity like John Kerry on his views . Things must remain consistent to be integral . This argument has a flaw . That when there is guaranteed religous freedomw then we dont ' have equal rights . Everyone has equal rights in terms of believing . However behavior is regualted by the government . Therefore we can do anyting in the name of religion until it violates behavior that is acceptable by society .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Fine , so what if the government said people are free to ' believe ' in God , but any sign of them putting their belief into practice , such as going to church or even just praying in private was illegal ? Would that be acceptable ? After all it is just regulating behaviourA , not belief ? Your comparisons are ludicrous . All of these situations involve non-consensual acts either through lack of knowledge or involvement of minors . You cannot compare that to consensual acts between adults . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That probably wouldn't be acceptable to most people but it would be legal and equal . They don't allow religious practices of polygamy , animal or human sacrifices , body mutilation , and many other religious practices . So then we should allow prostitution , polygamy , human trafficking , drug trafficking , gambling , drug distribution , and all other consensual acts .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But they obviously wouldn't be equal , because a significant proportion of the population would be restricted from worshipping how they want in a for that hurts nobody . These elements mostly have links to crime over and above the act itself , that justifies restrictions . Homosexuality doesn't . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The poeple would be equal . The religions would not . Look at our country . Almost all Christian beleifs are legal and no other non-Christians Churches have almost all their legal beleifs . That's it ? Crime ? That's it . The criminal link ? So if they criminalized homosexuality then it would be okay to ban gay marriage . Homosexuality has links to crime too . Sodomy is a crime . Define harm becaue homosexuality is harmful according to many .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>This is not equality . You are using the letter of the law to twist the purpose of the law , and even then doing it using very shaky logic . Equality is about general concepts , not specifics . It is equality to say ' everyone is has the same right to worship who they want ' , it is not equality to say ' everyone has the same right to worship who we tell them to ' . That is equality within an unequal system , which cannot be counted . Can you re-phrase , I don't follow . No . As I said , those have strong links to criminal activity irrespective of the act itself being a crime . For example drug use has noted links to theft , the same just cannot be said for homosexuality . No it isn't . And even if it was , that has nothing to do with homosexuality anyway . Physical or psychological injury or damage . Homosexuality is therefore in no way harmful . And I have serous doubts about the ' many ' who say it is . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Equality is treating every person the same . However it does not mean treating every person's behavior the same . It does not mean treat every organization the same either . Everyone has the same rights . NOt every religous practice , ideology , or behavior get the same treatment . Teh people determine what is in the public's interest to protect and ban . It basically only the Christian practices that are completely legal . Islamic polgamy and other religons don't have their practices recognized as often as christianity . Homosexuality has strong links to sodomy .

S1 believes that the structure that has been put in place because of morally based laws should not be compromised, because such compromise is detrimental to the integrity of the law. S1 believes that giving homosexuals the right to marry and be treated equally in the eyes of the law means the country is compromising the integrity of it's moral foundation. S2 argues that since citizens are given the right to religious freedom in this country, then homosexuals should be allowed to marry, since both behaviors are an individual expressing their own personal belief system. S1 points out that, though citizens do have the right to worship, there are certain acts pertaining to religion that are not acceptable in this country. S1 believes persons as individuals should all be treated equally, but that the actions of people should not be., and that consensual acts between homosexuals should not be accepted by society.

I will make one point here . Heterosexual marriage is one of the most universal of all human institutions , found in almost all cultures ever existing . With a precedent like that , the question isn't , " Why Mr. Galton are you opposed to gay marriage ? " The question is how do you justify revolutionizing that ancient institution ? To me , heterosexual marriage is the Parthenon : ancient , beautiful , crumbling some of late , but it would be a tragedy to knock it down , clear it out , and put in a new building . You prove to me why that new building is so gotdamn necessary .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It is circular to say marriage has simply always been heterosexual , end of debate . No one is talking about knocking down marriage . Gay families want to enter into it , because they want their families strengthened and protected as heterosexual families have been strenghtened and protected . Gay families want into the institution because they want to be a positive influence on it , to support it and to shore it up , not because they desire to harm it . They are fighting to get into it , as some heterosexuals can't wait to get out of it . I can't see if it would make such a dramatic change just because the couple are the same sex . Also marriage in the U.S. and Canada falls under common-law . This is a " living law " meant to evolve with society , with much room for interpretation by judges . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You're gonna have to explain your circularity argument for us slow folks . And you're gonna have to back up your statement that gays as a group are really in their hearts conservatives , with a love of traditional institutions like marriage . I strongly suspect that you have some homosexuals who want the right to marriage for romantic reasons , some who want it for economic / legal privilege reasons , but also very many who want it so as to affirm that homosexuality is just as good as heterosexuality . It's the idea of we're just as good as you are , so we must be able to have everything you can have . For many , I suspect it is not a desire to adopt a more conservative lifestyle , but to make a point , and move the culture toward greater acceptance . This is a risky gamble to shove this down peoples ' throats as it may cause a backlash instead of greater legitimization of the lifestyle . Oh and you've got to be kidding me that gay marriage doesn't revolutionize marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Takes us back to where we started , assumes it absolutely must be and cannot be different or change . Sure , there are many who want acceptance from society , parents , friends , and that is a big reason why they marry , for gays or straights . If gays want their marriages to compete with heterosexual marriages , to prove gay marriages can be more successful , wouldn't that be good for the institution ? The old fashioned backlash argument is not a reason to not do something , and frankly is a little tired and worn-out in 2004 . Gays are just as good as you are . Is there a problem with gays believing and acting like they are just as good ? We don't have the strong sense of different gender roles we once had , so why is it such a revolutionary change ? I can't see that it has revolutionized the societies where it is in effect . It could have represented the next step in a very gradual continuation of acceptance that had been going on for a long time . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I am not arguing that heterosexual marriage must be as it has been or cannot be different . I am arguing that that revolutionizing such an important , ancient institution requires some heavy justification . People who have no respect for the past may not find my point compelling ; people who look to the past with deep respect and see in it old wisdom will find it compelling . I for one do not want to revolutionize an ancient institution I have great respect for , in order so the gay community can prove something . Tired argument ?! My god , how long have we been debating gay marriage ? Only four or five years ago in grad school , we were discussing how difficult it would be to see more and more rights to be extended to cohabiting gays couples , and we talked a little bit about gay civil unions . Marriage wasn't even on the damn table ! Homosexuality is an eccentricity ; in my mind it is not equal in value to heterosexuality . This is not an issue of how gays believe and act ; it is an issue of whether we are going to enshrine homosexual marriage as we do with heterosexual marriage . Gender , sexuality , and family organization are absolutely fundamental aspects of society -- always have been , always will be .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes , the hetero-only definition of marriage has been around a long time . However , simply because something is traditional does not make it just . Well that's how you see it because of your contempt for the gay community . You see it as " them " trying to step out of their lower place , or prove they are not lower than you and equal in value . Your last comment I've dealt with in this post , demonstrates that very well . Yes , the backlash threat is tired and boring . No one is listening anymore . Well , I remember people talking about marriage for gays and lesbians and their rights for much longer . Well , that says it all about where you are coming from . You believe homosexuals are human beings of lesser value . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I believe homosexual behavior is an eccentricity and not equal in value to heterosexuality . I was not referring to the value of persons ; I think homosexuals have as much intrinsic value as anyone else . I have contempt for no one . Your attempt to paint people who disagree with you as haters is unfair and a cheap debate tactic .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Homosexuals are persons who have homosexual behaviour . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>We are all sophisticated enough to separate behavior from person . I don't have to tell you that homosexuals are MUCH more than whom they prefer to sleep with .<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Yes , there is also homosexual orientation , which is part of the person's homosexual identity , and part of the person's homosexuality . The orientation leads to the behaviour .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>0<br><br><b> key:   </b>1-7185_117_110__122_126_134_148_150_151_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>The court upheld equal protections . You accuse the court of illegitimate " judicial activism " for upholding such protections . Obviosly so far as you are concerned , if equal protections are upheld for gay Americans , it's illegitimate . Obviously not in the states that prohibit it . Can't you read the laws ? Indeed , the state and federal laws on the issue are specifically directed against gay people . It is woefully disingenuous of you to pretend otherwise . Another case of malicious disingenuity . Not even you can take it seriously with a straight face that these laws don't exist because gay people insist on equal rights , and homophobes want to deny them . If you don't know what equality means , by all means invest in a dictionary . Then you haven't much understanding of it . It applies to this case , and there are a large number of court decisions that agree with this understanding , this being just the latest . The straw men are all in your posts .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why can't you answer my question ? I simply said that it is illegitimate to say the constitution means one thing when it never has . I certainly can and there is nothing saying they can't within the restrictions by the law . Perhaps you don't . Let's look at marriage as an example . Marriage restrictions based on age , sex , species , number of , capacity , and perhaps a few other things . If you want " equal protection " the way you define it then all of these restrictions ( short of capacity ) would have to be removed . Is this what you mean by equal protection ? There seems to be more that disagree with you but that is beside the point . The only way you get to equal protection meaning what you want it to mean is if you evolve the constitution to a new meaning . If you can prove to me how gay marriage was part of the original meaning of the term " equal protection " then I'd be very much impressed . nice response Can you show me where I made a strawman ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Oh dear . I suppose I am extremely stupid in thinking that when a constitution says equal protections under the law , it means equal protections under the law . Evidently , it means : " Except gays " .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Can you show a document that suggests the original meaning of " equal protection " means equality for gays but not for other groups ? If you like I can explain the original understanding of the 14th amendment and how it wouldn't apply to gays unless they were denied marriage as defined today for being gay . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Can you show us a document that shows equality applies to groups other than gays ? Where does the Constitution say , " Except gays " ? Do you seriously imagine gay people want to marry the opposite sex ? Do you seriously think it is not an obstacle to their pursuit of life , liberty and happiness to prevent them from marrying the partners they love ? After all , you folk take your right to marry the consenting adults you love for granted , but for some pig-headed reason , you think it's OK to deny gay Americans the same rights you have . And you think that's constitutional ? Steve , that's bigotry .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are borderline breaking the rules of the forum . That aside , did you want me to explain the meaning of equal protection or not ? If it makes you feel better I wouldn't think it was denial of equal protection if marriage was denied as two men or two women marrying each other . No , they can't marry each other . Not sure how that is protection but if it is then consider gays protected too . I'm not saying you should think the way I do but at least I am trying to answer your questions and respond to your points . All you seem to be doing is ignoring my posts and insulting me . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>yawn . But since that is the denial of equal rights , obviously you would be wrong to think that . Nope . A very disingenuous argument . Gay partnerships are NOT protected the same way as straight ones -- in many places , they are illegal . That would be obvious even to a blind man , but not to someone deliberately denying the facts . I am pointing out that your opinions are wrong . As to why you make the erroneous arguments you do , i can only surmise .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No because in that case everyone is still allowed to marry under what marriage means . so is a daughter and father relationship which was the topic at hand ... Why are they wrong ? Why can't you explain why denial of some things that aren't equal is ok and doesn't violate equal protection but with gay marriage it does ?

If you don't follow the rules you don't qualify for the benefits . The fact that thereare rules does not mean anyone is barred from the custom .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And those rules used to include race as a qualifier for marriage . Neither blacks nor whites were allowed to marry outside of their race . Rights were applied equally based upon the confines of this criteria . If whom you wanted to marry fell outside of this criteria you were not allowed to wed . This is the same principal you are using to show equal rights amongst hetero and homo sexual people . The only difference is that as it stands now race has been removed from the criteria as it was viewed to be inappropriate and discriminatory . The gay marriage proponents are now advocating that gender be removed from the same criteria as it is also inappropriate and discriminatory . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Except they were demonstratably unequal . A black person could not marry those that a white person could marry , and white people were barred from marriage to those that black people were not barred from . Currently , there is no barrier that homosexual people have that heterosexual people do not share . The two situations are dissimilar . As long as there are any rules , this will be true .

This is the same argument that you are using to prove that there is no inequality between hetrosexuals and homosexuals . Yes , there is . A heterosexual couple can get married . A homosexual couple cannot . Your objection is a semantic one . Admittedly , no one has the right to marriage . But again I will reiterate . That is not the issue . The issue is homosexual couples cannot get married while heterosexual couples can . In so doing the government recognizes the heterosexual couple as significant members of the same family and award that couple benefits which include the ability to visit one another in a hospital , the ability to make impotortant life decisions if one of the members should become incompasitated , the ability to cover one another under their insurance , the ability to file taxes jointly , the ability to purchase property together and survivorship rights of said property , inheritance rights , and many others . These priveleges are being denied to homosexual couples . Not people , couples . They are being denied the above privelges not because the don't deserve them but because some people don't like the idea of them having sex . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not the criteria . The effect . Except that neither the qualifying criteria nor the effect is unequal between heterosexual and homosexual individuals . True , but couples do not have rights , individuals do . Agreed . I think it's more complicated than that , but that is essentially so . Heterosexual relationships are perceived as somehow more valid or as having a purpose that homosexual relationships lack . This is true ( if " purpose " is the right word ) on an evolutionary level , so the view has some validity . Of course , that should have no automatic policy implications but it would explain some of the resistance to the idea .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Agreed . Rights may not be the correct word . But there are benefits that heterosexual couples can obtain and homosexual couples cannot . Agreed . The bolded part of your post is the basis of gay marriage proponents . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The problem is that acquiring these marriage benefits depends on how people view that type of relationship . The biological or evolutionary " purpose " might not have automatic policy implications but they are made real by the people who vote on the issue .

He doubts whether S2 has ever had a lasting relationship, and states that he has been faithfully married for 31 years. He feels that there is a large amount of deviant activities taking place throughout the gay community, citing glory holes in highway restrooms (of which he says that any gay man will talk about if asked)  and a restroom on the I-75 highway being closed down due to gay encounters happening there.
   S2 feels that the sanctity of marriage has been denied to loving and committed couples due to americans paranoia over homosexuality, and that those who vote away the rights of others lack moral character. He doubts how S1 (as an outspoken,  straight and conservative man) would have came by his information, and states that S1 must hang out with a very sexually liberal gay crowd. He states his own confusion as to why S1 has any interest in the private lives of homosexuals and further questions whether S1's wife is aware of the interest.<br><b> key:   </b>1-2280_102_99__104_113_117_118_120_121_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Although Jim and MrWrite's debate has devolved into an unfortunate battle of screw you's , the comparison of the arguments against interacial marriage and those against gay marriage has some merit . At least that's what this article suggests : Opponents of gay marriage use many of the same arguments as foes of interracial relationships did before Loving v . Virginia outlawed state bans on interracial marriage in 1967 , said law professor Kim Forde-Mazrui at a talk sponsored by the Center for the Study of Race and Law and Lambda Law Alliance Sept . 30 . http://www.law.virginia.edu/home2002...fall/forde.htm<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This is not relevant to my argument at all . I have mentioned nothing about religious beliefs or bible-thumping protests against homosexuality . I did not bring interacial marriage into the discussion because it does not apply . I'm not against interacial marriage as long as there's a man and a woman involved . I did not bring the silly argument about water fountains into the discussion . Separate-but-equal does apply in the sense that records of legally recognized couples would separate married couples from same-sex couples but would not justify any inequalities regarding their rights and privileges . Hospital visitation , inheritance and other things could be afforded both . I'm wondering if those who insist on same-sex couples being called " married " are not acting somewhat from self-imposed shame ... like you want to hide the fact that you are gay . My argument has thusfar been limited to the requirement to redefine several other words if we redefine " marriage " . It has nothing to do with homophobia which , by the way , I do not suffer from . I have some friends that are gay and they know how I feel about the word " marriage " . We remain friends . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I accept your argument at face value , although I will say that I believe that the majority of people who argue against gay marriage do so for religious or homophobe reasons . ( Again , I'm not saying you fall into these categories . ) Words get redefined all the time , and some of them are just as important as the word ' marriage ' . For example , the Iraq War is not technically a war -- congress never declared war . And this isn't just a semantic detail , either . Declaring war used to mean that congress committed , the president committed , and all the citizens made sacrifices for the cause . Now we initiate military operations , never declare war in order to allow political wiggle room , cut everyone's taxes , tell them to go shopping , and call it a war anyway . Now that's redefining a word . Substituting a Jack for a Jill on a marriage license seems pretty minor in comparison to me .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The invasion of Iraq was a resumption of warfare that ended in a cease fire . It was not technically a new war requiring all the congressional steps . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not to derail this thread -- we can talk about this more in the Politics section -- but the last time the US Congress declared war was for WWII . So the conflict in Iraq is not in fact a resumption of a prior declared war .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're technically correct . However , the Gulf War was approved by Congress whether it was a declared war or not . The Iraq War was a continuation of the same conflict after a cease fire . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I understand the Bush administration has made this argument , but I don't think it has a whole lot of merit . It was a different presidential administration and the reasons for the conflict were different -- to repel the invasion of Kuwait . Not to mention that the same logical argument could be used to begin a fresh invasion of Vietnam or Korea .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I think not . Those conflicts ended in something other than a cease fire .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>229<br>S1 feels that Jim and MrWrite's argument has become a battle of insults, and that this is unfortunate, but that the comparison between the argument against gay marriage and that against interracial marriage is not baseless. He cites that opponents of gay marriage use many of the same arguments that were used to oppose interracial marriage, before that was outlawed. He believes that most opponents of gay marriage do so for religious or homophobic reasons. He argues that words get redefined on an ongoing basis, citing the word war being modified to suit political purposes. He does not believe that the justifications for the current war in Iraq have much merit, and that the same argument could be made for reentering Vietnam or Korea.
   S2 doesn't feel that interracial marriage and homosexual marriage have anything to do with each other. He feels that separate-but-equal would apply to the records of gay couples but wouldn't justify any restrictions of there rights or privileges as a couple. He preemptively denies being homophobic, citing his having gay friends who know what his views on the word marriage are. He does not feel that the Iraq War is technically a new war requiring all of the congressional steps, rather that it was merely a continuation of the Gulf War, or that the same arguments could be applied  to those other conflicts.<br><b> key:   </b>1-5811_33_29__35_38_40_41_43_2 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Don't you think that in 1909 it was probably viewed mostly from a moral standpoint ? I don't think they saw it the same way they would see black people . They didn't even realize that ' homosexuality ' was any sort of innate thing . It was entirely behavioral to them . I tend to agree with the court , even given what you've said . I doubt for 1909 it was about prejudice and bigotry -- they genuinely felt it was wrong . The concept of gay marriage was completely foreign and unknown in 1909 . It wasn't even something they conceived of . I think the court is saying that they couldn't have been prejudiced against something they didn't even know of or conceive of .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Hogwash . It was once entirely moral to believe certain races were inferior , and that women had fewer rights than men . Treating the races and women as equal was not something even thought of by many . It was prejudice against gays then , and it still is today . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>This is not really true . It's a popular misconstruing of morality and history by proponents of modern ' rights ' movements , but it's not true . There's little historical backing to the idea that people believed oppressing black people was a right thing to do , as in , doing good . There were times they used an argument where religion was wrongly used to justify their behavior , but that's a different matter . If you firmly believe otherwise , I'd challenge you to show where people thought oppressing blacks was an example if doing good . The same goes for misogyny . Furthermore , it's beside the point anyway . We're talking about homosexuality . In 1909 , the only thing they really understood about the issue at hand was that some people engaged in sexual relations with people of their own gender . There were no articles about " homosexuality " as a trait , and certainly none about genetic causes . It was understood entirely from a behavioral standpoint , and therefore a moral standpoint . So it's not hogwash at all -- they really did view gay sex as immoral . If you don't think so , then you have a very poor grasp on history in this case .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This kind of morality is based on nothing but ignorance ( which you admit ) and prejudice . What kind of a basis is that for a so-called moral code ? So what if it involves behaviour ? Gay people have sex , develop relationships , and bond , just like everyone else , but in a way that reflects their gay sexuality . This does not mean people could not be prejudiced about the way gay people live . People were , and are so prejudiced . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>A better reverse analogy would have been to say " So then conversly I have the right to advocate that heterosexual relations are morally wrong " . Not heterosexuality , since it's not homosexuality ( as it's a state of being ) that religious people have a problem with . Heck , they often don't even recognize it . With that caveat , yes you are certainly free to advocate whatever you want to be morally wrong . ( And unlike the way some in your movement do , I won't call you a " bigot " for doing so ! ) It may have been based on " ignorance " , but I reject the notion it was based on prejudice ( and therefore I tend to agree with the 6 - 0 view of the justices here ) . The 1909 society had too little understanding of gay people to be prejudiced over in the first place . Remember , homosexuality was not understood as a state of being at that time . The term itself had not been around long and was not known to most people . And even to those it was known to , it was not known as a state of being . And there certainly was no social identity among gay people as a group -- how could prejudice have existed if there was nothing ( from their perspective ) to be prejudiced toward ?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Right . Provided gays don't live gay , but live straight , gays can be as gay as they want . As long as gays don't outwardly show what makes them different from straights , gays can be as gay as they want . It's bs . Also some may not recognize the existence of gay people or their gay lives , but that is putting one's head in the sand . Nonsense . People would widely and hatefully use the term " sodomite " to refer to gays . Before that the term was " molly " . Clearly there was an identity they were prejudiced towards . They were rounding up gays in areas they were known to attend , and putting them in prison . Read up on the trial of Oscar Wilde . Gays may have been forced underground , to a greater extent , but that does not mean they were not thought of . Gays were just not thought of in a nice way . Gays were purposely kept out of everything in society , when society didn't really think of gays as human too . That isn't prejudice ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Because they didn't approve of sodomy ! Do you not agree they didn't understand the concept of homosexuality ??? There was no social identity . When they were put on trial , it wasn't because they were gay ( which they had no concept of ) , it was because they had gay relations which society viewed as wrong ! No , here's where you don't get it -- it's not that " gays " ( there was no concept of that ) were purposely kept out of of everything , it's that people who had sodomy relationships were kept out of everything , because sodomy was viewed as wrong . They really did think it was wrong ! You are so determined to portray everything that has anything to do with gay relations possibly being wrong as prejudice and bigotry that you are close-minded about it .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>184<br>S1 believes that society in 1909 were being prejudiced in their intolerance for gay's, rather that they didn't have any concept of homosexuality, and that they were merely treating gays as if they were committing morally wrong acts, by their own free will not by any sort of genetical predisposition. He does not believe that people of the time thought that oppression of blacks or women was doing good, but that there were occasionally  religious arguments made to support those behaviors.
   S2 feels that this argument is hogwash. He makes no distinction between prejudice against behavior and that against states of being. He feels that basing a moral code on ignorance and prejudice are not intelligent. He cites that men from a certain time did not even think that women or other races should be viewed as being equal. He finds the idea that, as long as gays lead straight lives they are accepted, to be personally offensive. He points to the terms "sodomite" and "molly" as proof that people had an identity that they felt hatred towards.<br><br><b>worker_id </b>A306K1MOYERWOU<br>HITid:</b>  3Z3R5YC0P3N3RJ7OKJQT13Z4S9SFTX<br> <b>Status:</b>Approved<br><b> key:   </b>1-10073_119_44__120_124_127_129_130_131_132_133_134_6 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>I really wish that you would read my posts before commenting .

Certainly , you may argue that contracts drawn by a paid attorney or myself could reap these same benefits , but I do not understand what legitimate reason my family must jump through these hoops when heterosexual headed households are not required , asked or even expected to do the same .

In a modern secular society there is no reason not to extend marriage to other forms of relationships . However just extending marriage to gay couples is not enough , it must be extended to all permutations of sexual relationships and society must look at sexual relationships that are otherwise banned . I cannot see why marriage should be granted to you but an incestuous relationship be illegal . Making homosexual sex legal is a far cry to making gay relationships officially equal to hetero ones . You are no ' better ' than two half brothers having a sexual relationship or a mother and son ..o r indeed a polygamous gay relationship ... it all deviates from the present definition of marriage .

I dont see why gays should have their relationships officialised ( is that a word ? ) and pull up the ladder so other types of relationships cannot follow . Before gay marriage is allowed then all types of sexual relationships should be considered . Lets face it , it would be far harder for people to accept a complete revolution in what we consider to be an appropriate relationship to become an official family than to just allow gays to do it ... using the very arguments that gays have to justify them officially marrying we can justify most other type of marriage .

He does not feel that gay marriage should be prohibited, rather that it is simply different than a normal heterosexual marriage, and to recognize this difference is not discrimination. He feels that if gay relationships were to be allowed then not extending the same benefits to all forms of relationships between consenting adults would then be discriminatory.

   S2 makes the case that he has been with his partner for 15 years, and will be having his own biological children soon.

Next , although Bush won by a larger margin than Bill Clinton ( who you term " slick Willie " for no other reason than to anger and insult his supporters , I assume ? ) , this does not mean that Clinton did not win by a larger percentage .

All the protesting in the world wouldn't have brought it about if the will of the people were not changing to make it happen . At the end of the day , any legislative movement needs the will of the people to be successful . It may not need a full majority in some cases , but it needs enough people on board . That's why legislation requires not only voting ( by legislature ) , but elected officials to do so as well . There was a process our country went through on those issues as whether or not they were legitimate in terms of the law -- it involved a national debate , protests , etc. Sometimes this process results in our country ( the people ) granting civil rights legislation , and sometimes it doesn't ( depending on whether it is deemed warranted ) . The process ( which will undoubtedly take years ) is going on right now in regards to gays . Time will tell what the result will be . Any form of legislation is a voting matter . That's the way our system works .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why is it that whenever this comes up you insist on conflating " the people voting on a law " with " the legislature voting on a law " or " the people electing politicians " ?

Again , why can't you answer that question ; why do you feel that it's necessary to move the topic around ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Fair enough ; but regardless , the point still stands -- people voting on laws is indeed allowed under our system . ( Ballot initiatives . ) It is all part of the process I mentioned to Matthew of society determining its standards . If you have a beef with the people being able to work toward determining our society's standards ( through voting on such issues ) , then if I were you I'd take it up with the govt .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Or we could take it up here , like Matthew did , and discuss it . Or at least try to , and hope someone doesn't derail the conversation into irrelevant issues like how the legislature works . I will echo the point that several have made here . The idea of allowing the masses to determine civil rights is stupid and wrong . If a group's civil rights need protecting , then they need protecting from the very masses that are doing the voting . Ballot measures may be a legal process , but that doesn't prevent them from being stupid and wrong , now does it ? That's the point that's trying to be made here . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well , that's up to you . If you don't want to derail it , you don't have to . It seems to me that what is really happening in society with these ballot initiatives and other parts of the process is determining whether or not it is a civil right in the first place to give legal marriage to whatever group arrangement is in question . ( In this case , gays couples . ) That process has to take place ; it is just not feasible in our society to give marriage equality to any group of any arrangement that comes along demanding it until we determine for certain that it needs to be done . If society determines that same-sex arrangements of two people should suffice to redefine marriage for it to be included , then so be it . But that process has to be there in some form , realistically . If you are going to draw the line in terms of what can be voted on a ballot initiative or not , what authority determines that ? How are you going to determine where that line is drawn ? And you can't just arbitrarily say " when civil rights are being infringed " because that doesn't carry any legal weight -- it's opinion . Just saying it's " stupid " and " wrong " may be your point being made , but it's a point that doesn't offer any solutions .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You really are a piece of work .

You will of course claim that the government can't do anything , but history has proven that position wrong . The government has taken stands against biggotry before , and while it hasn't eradicated it , it has improved things .

If you want to change those rules and requirements then by all means lobby to do so . You are entitled to do so . Equally people who do not wish to change the rules and regulations are entitled to lobby to keep the status quo . You only BELIEVE gays have the right to marriage . Other people BELIEVE they do not . Ask for a vote on it and abide by the majority decision .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Isn't cruel and unjust to decide that someone else should not have what you enjoy ? How would you feel if the world was the other way around . How would you feel if the world were gay and you as a heterosexual were being told you couldn't marry the person you loved because it was against someone elses , that you didn't know or have never met , religious beliefs or that they have some sort of ikk factor ? Can you not put youself in the place of gay people and ask yourself how would I feel ? Do you have any empathy ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>In answer to your first question as it stands , No , it happens all the time . If society had set up the institution of marriage as a gay one since OG was in his cave then I would certainly try and lobby otherwise if I disagreed . If the lobbying failed and the rest of Society said we keep things the way we want them however sorry they may feel , then I would clearly have to abide by that , although lobbying would continue . However castigating people because of their beliefs or stating they shouldn't have them , must be wrong . Otherwise I could claim that you are not entitled to your beliefs which clearly you are<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That is not what I asked you . Do you really lack any empathy ? I didn't ask you what you would do I asked you how you would feel . Let's try again How would you feel if the world was the other way around ? How would you feel if the world were gay and you as a heterosexual were being told you couldn't marry the person you loved because it was against someone elses , that you didn't know or have never met , religious beliefs or that they have some sort of ikk factor ? Can you not put youself in the place of gay people and ask yourself how would I feel ? Do you have any empathy ? For the record I do not believe I have the right to tell anyone who they should be allowed to marry but many of those that are anti same sex marriage think that they have a right to tell people who they should be allowed to marry . Just because something happens all the time does not mean it is not cruel and unjust . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>First of all it is not against " someone else's beliefs " in that incredibly simplistic way . It is against the beliefs of society since the year dot , religious beliefs or ' ikk ' factor whatever that is are irrelevant even if they contribute to some people's attitudes . Second yes I would probably feel sad if I wasn't allowed to marry the person I was with BUT I would be with the person I love in any event . Thirdly , as marriage is looked on as a public institution then Society as a whole is entitled to lay down the rules relating to it just as Society lays down the rules and laws by which we live . Cruelty and injustice occur when you are stopped from doing something you are entitled to do . Gay marriage at present is not something you are entitled to it would seem . Have to say in the UK we have made some steps towards that .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I really think you can not put yourself in someone elses place . So you believe that " Cruelty and injustice occur when you are stopped from doing something you are entitled to do . " ? Is this correct ? So if I use your belief on another topic , say slavery , you then would conclude that slavery was neither cruel nore injust 1 since it was a legal and traditional activity practiced since OG was in the cave 2 slaves should not think it was cruel and unjust because they had no legal rights and standing and thus was not cruel and unjust since they were slaves . My point is just because something is the law or not the law does not make it any less cruel or unjust when viewed from a certain perspective . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Firstly I am not even going to put slavery on the same level as gay marriage . I frankly do not believe that the alleged suffering gays not being allowed to marry comes in any way close to the suffering of slaves . Secondly you are of course perfectly correct about cruelty and injustice ( neither or certainly the first one do I think apply to gay marriage ) and the way forward was to lobby etc as Wilberforce did to abolish slave trade . We can only advance in civilisation ( I hope ) but lobbying publicity etc can help people's awareness in bring matters before their eyes to decide on . There will always be minorities of dissenters ( strange world if none ) but in the last analysis Society determines how it is run . You talk about the tyranny of the majority but of course the reverse can also be true .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I am not comparing the two . I am using your own beliefs and statements and appling them to slavery .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>195<br>S1 maintains that the current definition of marriage, being a public institution that has remained unchanged since cave man days, is neither cruel, nor unjust. S1 says that if the gay marriage laws of society are not to your liking than you should lobby for change, put the decision to a vote, and abide by the decision. S1 states that cruelty and injustice occur when you are stopped from doing something that you are not allowed to do, and further denies that the alleged suffering of gays is comparable to that of the slaves. 
    S2 believes that the ban on gay marriage is cruel and unjust, he likens the injustice of gay marriage to that of the slave trade. S2 believes that suffering and injustice should not be allowed, even if the institution that allows it has always been the law of the land. S2 states that it is not the suffering of one group to that of the other that was compared, but that S1's beliefs were being applied to the slave trade, particularly that it was the law at the time, where today it is illegal.<br><b> key:   </b>1-10349_9_5__17_40_43_50_52_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>The cultural meaning of marriage is a formalization of a mating pair , who , in turn , create and support a family unit . Love and reproduction are implied . The legal meaning of marriage is , in most States , a contract between two people who are not under the age of consent , of different genders , of the same species , not closely related and who are not already married . Homosexuals are not a part of the traditional or cultural meaning of marriage . In order to be included , the meaning of marriage would have to change . The catch-22 is that homosexual couples want to be included in the current meaning of marriage , but what gives marriage meaning specifically excludes homosexual couples .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That's your definition . It is certainly not my definition . You don't speak for all of society . I personally define marriage as a union of two people who love one another and wish to make a commitment to one another . If marriage is about reproduction , why does nobody bat an eye when a 65 year old woman marries a 68 year old man ? If you believe marriage is " formalization of a mating pair " , and " reproduction is implied " , doesn't this cheapen the institution of marriage in your eyes ? Obviously , they are not getting married to start a family ... perhaps love is what is important ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Mating pairs exist with or without marriage , and have no legal connection with marriage ( since , legally , it doesn't matter if the two people even like one another , or ever intend on consumating said marriage ) . The only connection between a mating couple and marriage is the connection made on a cultural level . So , logically , the cultural meaning of marriage would be the purpose of a mating couple . While ' purpose ' can mean different things , in this context I daresay most would refer to the evolutionary purpose of a mating couple : reproduction . Love is implied because love brings the couple together for that purpose . While legally a 27 yr old marrying a 70 yr old sugar daddy is not a problem , culturally speaking this marriage is not as meaningful as one that is in-line with the evolutionary purpose I outlined above . You can point to exceptions all you want , but all it does is outline the difference between the legal meaning and the cultural meaning of marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Who gave you the power to decide what is culturally meaningful ? And more importantly , should we legally define marriage based on your perception of " cultural meaning " ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No , you should legally define it any damn way you can get away with . The cultural definition comes from observation .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But who get's to decide that legal definition ... that's the point . In this specific case in point , the anti crowd wishes to limit the rights of others simply based on personally held beliefs ... when no harm is presented to any party involved . In a case such as this , I feel strongly that without a specific vector of harm , we must as a civilized society rule in favor of providing equal rights rather than limit rights of a minority . I think these 4 pages thus far make clear that cultural definition is based on subjective obeservation and personal opinion formed via that observation . Clearly , I and many others here do not share your cultural definition . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>In America the people generally vote on issues , or elect representatives to enact laws . That's how you change the legal definitions . This isn't about equality , snakespit . The title of this thread shows that :P In all seriousness , though , it really isn't about equality . I don't think you have a rational basis upon which to dispute that observation . It is an indisputible fact that the cultural view that has dominated this country ( as evidenced by the definition of marriage ) generally follows evolutionarily sound logic : monogamous pair bonding outside of close familial ties . Inclusion of homosexuals would obviously change that .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>186<br>S1 states that the legal definition of marriage is a contract between a man and a woman, who are not related, with no regard to love, or the intention of reproduction. S1 maintains, from the basis of observation, that the cultural definition of marriage is a formalization of a mating pair, love and the intension to reproduce being implied. Saying that homosexual couples are not a part of either definition, and that being included in the current definition is a catch-22, as homosexuality is not in sync with evolution. S1 further states that the only connection between, mating couples and marriage, are cultural.
    S2 defines marriage as a commitment between two people who love one another. Using a hypothetical marriage between a 65 year old woman and a 68 year old man as an example, argues that reproduction has no bearing on the definition of marriage, and that without a harm involved, equality of rights is what is important. S2 believes that personal opinions are subjective and should not be used as the basis to limit the rights of the minority.<br><b> key:   </b>1-10349_72_70__75_82_83_84_85_86_87_88_89_90_94_95_99_4 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>I'm speaking of everyone who lives in the society ... it's implicit that we agree to live by the laws of that society :P A social contract , if you will .

If the meaning were solely based upon religion then it would be an arbitrary custom . But it's based upon biology , which isn't an arbitrary difference .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>As long as 70 year olds are allowed to marry then you have lost that arguement . What is the difference between a couple of 70 year olds and a gay couple ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>A heterosexual bond's ultimate causation is to facilitate reproduction . Pointing out a particular couple who does not reproduce would not change that fact :P Marriage is a formalization of that bond . Rofl , you would still have a problem with that , don't lie . After all , OMG THEY HAVE BENEFITS YOU DON'T GET OMG . And that's unconstitutional isn't it , Matthew S. At least according to your flawed reasoning .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I want equality . The lack of is what I find unconstitutional and unjust . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Surely , and in your little scenario married people still have benefits that you don't get . So it's a lie that you'd ' be ok with that ' since you've been pretty loudly outspoken about that very point . That if anyone has benefits you don't get then it must be unconstitutional .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I have had this idea for years . http://www.4forums.com/political/gay...man-woman.html <br><b>S1:4-  </b>lol , so what ? You've also been braying about how if some people have benefits that you don't have access to ( and in your scenario it would be much less possible for you to get those benefits ) then it must be unconstitutional . So either you're a hypocrite or you don't actually pay attention to what you say .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I actually have a marriage license . The same license that everyone gets from the state of Iowa , yet my license is not recognized by either the federal government or the state of Michigan , how is that not unconstitutional ? Why are those the only two options ? I want equality and I don't care how it comes about . If my rules where applied to marriage , yes it would suck , but I would then be treated equally to those heteros , who currently do not breed , can not breed , or choose not to breed , yet can get a marriage license at the drop of a hat and have it recognized . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Because the Constitution does not require them to :P It has been long established that States have authority over marriage definitions . Because , gasp , they get marriage benefits while you do not ! Are you saying it's equal for some people to get marriage benefits but single people do not ?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>What is it about the same piece of paper you do not understand ? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>The reason you have that paper is the same reason other States don't have to honor it . That reason is : States decide for themselves what constitutes a marriage . I'm still interested in the fact that you're ok with some people getting marriage benefits and others not getting them .<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Once again the state of Iowa issues one piece of paper to everyone . What part of that do you not understand ? The other states and the federal government must recognize all or none . If marriage is to be about breeders and breeding children , and my rules are adopted by the state then yes I am alright . If my rules were adopted then almost no one would get married , and those who get married have to breed if they don't they are no longer married . They have to have 3 witnesses to their act of breeding , along with a video of the event stored in the public records of the county were they live . <br><b>S1:7-  </b>I understand every part of that . Nothing makes States recognize all or none , Matthew S. In fact , it's been true since the ratification that States establish their own marriage laws ... and anyone in the State is subject to those marriage laws . It doesn't matter what other States say about your marriage because you're not in those States . No you aren't because some people would have marriage benefits but you will not . You've been very vocal that if anyone gets marriage benefits when you do not then it must be unconstitutional . Are you now saying that it's perfectly Constitutional for only some people to get marriage benefits ? And you're wrong , of course . People would get married . Besides ' having witnesses ' ( which is for the signing of the contract not the execution , duh ) , a lifelong relationship with children is the ideal marriage . It's what people hope to have .<br><b> S2:7-  </b>And why would gay people be any different ? What we have is you saying to me that I can't get married because you have some belief against it . I wish I could say to you , you can't go to that place or do that thing because I have a belief against you doing so . <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Saying heterosexuals are the same as homosexuals is political fiction . At some point you'll have to realize that biological differences exist and sometimes that has ramifications for how you're treated .

You're sitting there demanding the world be changed to suit leftys as if it is your due , while at the same time casually denying that anything was made for rightys in the first place . It's insulting , ignorant and arrogant . I'd oppose you for those reasons alone :P You can . You really can . All you need is for a lot of people to agree with you .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>180<br>S1 believes that marriage, in it's conception, was made for biological reasons, that marriage exists to allow children to be born more easily. Although this should, in no way force people to have children, or their being capable of having children in the first place make a difference. S1 says that heterosexuals and homosexualsare fundamentally different, and that that difference is why they are treated differently. S1 compares the institution of marriage to the world being built to accommodate right handed people, and is insulted that the world should be forced to be changed for lefties, not believing they have that right. 
    S2 feels that, the federal government and other states, not recognizing his marriage license, is unconstitutional, as Iowa issues the same license for both hetero- and homosexual couples. He feels that there is no difference between a gay couple getting married, and a 70 year old straight couple getting married.

  S2 feels that Colson has done very well for being a felon, but that he should stop drawing conclusions about gay parenthood based on observations of single parenthood. He thinks S1 does not actually support gay rights, but is purposely misrepresenting himself, and points to times that he said one thing and then voiced opposition to that same thing.

He feels that the broadening of what constitutes the definition of marriage would somehow weaken traditional marriage. This, he says, would lead to more crime.
  S2 feels that the problems with traditional marriage in this country began long before gay marriage began to be legalized. He makes an analogy of a man jumping out of a plane before gay marriage, and gay marriage being blamed. He does not feel that gay marriage has any effect on traditional marriage at all, and that society is not harmed by the inclusion of gay marriage.

But two men could live together and be extremely close without being homosexual .. the homosexual element comes in at the genital fondling stage . You know it but cry ' dirty minds ' when this is stated . Pathetic and Miss piggy and kermit are interspecies but not portrayed as sexually active but gays like you want us to believe bert and ernie are .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No . You can portray some of the straight human characters as being married , without it being anything close to an adult sex film . In this case , some are just saying they would like two charcters who are both male to be married . Straight or gay can discuss the fact of marriage , without getting into sex act details or even touching the topic of sex acts . I believe that , and if you don't when it comes to gays , it is indeed you who has the dirty mind where the topic at hand is concerned . Who else has mentioned sex acts ? No one . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Well once we you have same sex marriages then you may have straight men marrying . There may be advantages in this for some straight men . However it seems that the people who wish to see Ernie and Bert get married are men who have sex with each other . You and other gays want Bert and Ernie to be seen as gay men ie men who are sexually attracted to other men . You are all the more sickenly dishonest by pretending otherwise . One does not need to actually show or discuss the sexual acts of people when describing their sexuality ... you are the one that is stupidly suggesting this . However the fact remains that people do have sex and gays have a deviant form of it . There is no evidence that Bert and Ernie have deviant sex but you want them to be described as such but under the guise of ' married ' .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Straight men can already get married to women , so what the hell would be the point of marrying a man if it's not your orientation and you can have everything in marriage anyway ?! No , not necessarily . It can be celibate gay men or straight people who support gay inclusion and think this is the correct way to accomplish it . You can de-emphasize the sexual part , because you are dealing with children , the same way you do from different sex marriages . Nope . You stupidly said it when you suggested Bert and Ernie playing with their genitals . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So you are saying only gays can have same sex marriages ? Why ? Two men could have a sexless marriage . maybe even have girlfriends . Would you discriminate against this lifestyle ? But they would still want to have sex with other men though wouldnt they ? You want Bert and Ernie to WANT to have sex with other men ie homosexual . Wht cant they just be friends ? Straight De emphasise the fact that the people who want them to be married are homosexuals more Straight Thats what homosexuals do isnt it ?<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>219<br>S1 believes that Bert and Ernie are just two men who are really good friends and happen to live together. He feels that the homosexual deviants want to see Bert and Ernie as gay and is sickened by the hypocrisy of them saying that they don't feel that way. He feels that Kermit and Miss Piggy are not portrayed as being sexually active but that calling Bert and Ernie gay would automatically mean that they were. He also feels that if gay marriage were to be legalized then there would be some straight men who would find it to their advantage to get married to other men for the benefits.
   S2 refutes that he wants Bert and Ernie to be gay, and that he had never said anything like that, and that S1 should look at the false fallacy paradox that was mentioned earlier. He feels that S1 has a dirty mind for saying that that was what he had thought, pointing that it was S1 who brought up sexual topics in the first place. He refutes that he wanted anything to do with a sexual relationship on a kids program, just that there could be married couples on Sesame Street, straight or gay there wouldn't have to be any mention of sexual situations.</p><br><br><b>worker_id </b>A2TMWYLZY40I9<br>HITid:</b>  3KTCJ4SCVG18O9NW4NAWQN0IXREM13<br> <b>Status:</b>Approved<br><b> key:   </b>1-10951_14_13__15_16_18_20_21_22_23_24_30_31_32_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>In the end you godless heathens will be in Hell and we'll be on the other side of the great divide looking down on your endless misery , just like in the story of the Rich Man and Lazarus .

He argues that if S2 believes the Gospels are fiction, then it should be simple to provide evidence against the resurrection, but that this evidence is not available because the Bible is true. He further claims that President Obama is a spiritual imbecile for supporting same-sex marriage and attempting to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and that anyone who supports him is also a spiritual imbecile. 
S2 accuses S1 of having poor rhetoric because he does not provide any evidence and resorts to using insults and threats and shifting the topic. He also attacks S1 for referencing Fox News as a source of information. He also points out that S1 claims he is going to Heaven because of his belief, but then cites several Bible verses suggesting that you must do more than just believe.<br><b> key:   </b>1-9391_518_516__520_523_526_531_539_8 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>I'm saying that the limit to opposite sexes is one limit among others . If you don't follow the rules you don't qualify for the benefits . The fact that thereare rules does not mean anyone is barred from the custom .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And those rules used to include race as a qualifier for marriage . Neither blacks nor whites were allowed to marry outside of their race . Rights were applied equally based upon the confines of this criteria . If whom you wanted to marry fell outside of this criteria you were not allowed to wed . This is the same principal you are using to show equal rights amongst hetero and homo sexual people . The only difference is that as it stands now race has been removed from the criteria as it was viewed to be inappropriate and discriminatory . The gay marriage proponents are now advocating that gender be removed from the same criteria as it is also inappropriate and discriminatory . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Except they were demonstratably unequal . A black person could not marry those that a white person could marry , and white people were barred from marriage to those that black people were not barred from . Currently , there is no barrier that homosexual people have that heterosexual people do not share . The two situations are dissimilar . As long as there are any rules , this will be true . No-one may marry someone already married , an animal , a minor , or a sibling . There is nothing wrong with trying to change the status quo , but you don't have a right to the changes you want . They are just changes you want .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Yes , the qualifying criteria for marriage at the time was unequal which is why race was removed from criteria . But anyone who wanted to get married had to meet this criteria which was applied to everyone . This is the same argument that you are using to prove that there is no inequality between hetrosexuals and homosexuals . Yes , there is . A heterosexual couple can get married . A homosexual couple cannot . Your objection is a semantic one . Admittedly , no one has the right to marriage . But again I will reiterate . That is not the issue . The issue is homosexual couples cannot get married while heterosexual couples can . In so doing the government recognizes the heterosexual couple as significant members of the same family and award that couple benefits which include the ability to visit one another in a hospital , the ability to make impotortant life decisions if one of the members should become incompasitated , the ability to cover one another under their insurance , the ability to file taxes jointly , the ability to purchase property together and survivorship rights of said property , inheritance rights , and many others . These priveleges are being denied to homosexual couples . Not people , couples . They are being denied the above privelges not because the don't deserve them but because some people don't like the idea of them having sex . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not the criteria . The effect . Except that neither the qualifying criteria nor the effect is unequal between heterosexual and homosexual individuals . True , but couples do not have rights , individuals do . Agreed . I think it's more complicated than that , but that is essentially so . Heterosexual relationships are perceived as somehow more valid or as having a purpose that homosexual relationships lack . This is true ( if " purpose " is the right word ) on an evolutionary level , so the view has some validity . Of course , that should have no automatic policy implications but it would explain some of the resistance to the idea .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Agreed . Rights may not be the correct word . But there are benefits that heterosexual couples can obtain and homosexual couples cannot . Agreed . The bolded part of your post is the basis of gay marriage proponents . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The problem is that acquiring these marriage benefits depends on how people view that type of relationship . The biological or evolutionary " purpose " might not have automatic policy implications but they are made real by the people who vote on the issue .

He claims that this is different from the previous rule limiting marriage to intraracial couples. He further argues that heterosexual relationships are more valid at the evolutionary level because they have a reproductive purpose. 
S2 argues that gender should be removed as a criteria for marriage in the same way that race was because it is inappropriate and discriminatory. He claims that it is unfair for heterosexuals to be eligible for the benefits of marriage such as the ability to make important medical decisions, to cover each other under their insurance, to file taxes jointly, to purchase property together, to visit each other in the hospital, or to be a legal heir, when those same privileges are denied to homosexuals.<br><b> key:   </b>1-9391_370_363_1_371_372_373_374_376_377_378_384_385_389_390_391_392_394_395_11 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Its nothing like racial segregation ....<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It's everything like racial segregation and every kind of segregation throughout the course of history .

The Democrats certainly did a better job fiscally , keeping the books ballanced , when they were in power .

There are dozens of such precedents for not acknowledging licenses issued in other states . The 10th Amendment says that those rights not specifically given to the Feds belong to the State or individuals .

Perhaps some people are capable of thinking from another's point of view , if God is a loving parent I can't see how you can justify the view that anything lethal can be used as a punishment . I don't think you know how genetics works in this instance . Or do you think that the method of upbringing they have is purely responisble ? I don't really see any real problem with polygamy itself , but it would have to be watched a little more carefully perhaps as the cultures that practise polygamy tend to be less focused on equality between sexs . As long as you make sure that the marriages are still volentary for both partners and that any person is fully able to leave if they want to then I can't really see the problem . However it is a lot more complicated if you are looking from the benefits point of view with respect to inheritance and other aspects ( child support and suchlike ) but these are realitively minor points that would just have to be worked out if this type of marriage was to be recognised<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>179<br>S1 claims that the Biblical prophecy that there will be wars and earthquakes in the future is not valid proof, that it is merely a recognition that people and nature continue to behave in the same way as time progresses.

I didn't bring up religon in my argument . Jake did . So please don't specualte anything until you knwo what we're talking about . All laws are based upon morals . So it is based upon the morals of the country whcih happen to be predominantly Christian . England was one of many countries . There is no new family structure that didn't exist before this country . My definition of negative effect is that the puposes for which something is created is hindered or compromises . By changing standards there is a harm to it's integrity . Intregrity is compromised when it isn't stable . Soemthing that changes all teh time loses that integrity like John Kerry on his views . Things must remain consistent to be integral . This argument has a flaw . That when there is guaranteed religous freedomw then we dont ' have equal rights . Everyone has equal rights in terms of believing . However behavior is regualted by the government . Therefore we can do anyting in the name of religion until it violates behavior that is acceptable by society .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Fine , so what if the government said people are free to ' believe ' in God , but any sign of them putting their belief into practice , such as going to church or even just praying in private was illegal ? Would that be acceptable ? After all it is just regulating behaviourA , not belief ? Your comparisons are ludicrous . All of these situations involve non-consensual acts either through lack of knowledge or involvement of minors . You cannot compare that to consensual acts between adults . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That probably wouldn't be acceptable to most people but it would be legal and equal . They don't allow religious practices of polygamy , animal or human sacrifices , body mutilation , and many other religious practices . So then we should allow prostitution , polygamy , human trafficking , drug trafficking , gambling , drug distribution , and all other consensual acts .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But they obviously wouldn't be equal , because a significant proportion of the population would be restricted from worshipping how they want in a for that hurts nobody . These elements mostly have links to crime over and above the act itself , that justifies restrictions . Homosexuality doesn't . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The poeple would be equal . The religions would not . Look at our country . Almost all Christian beleifs are legal and no other non-Christians Churches have almost all their legal beleifs . That's it ? Crime ? That's it . The criminal link ? So if they criminalized homosexuality then it would be okay to ban gay marriage . Homosexuality has links to crime too . Sodomy is a crime . Define harm becaue homosexuality is harmful according to many .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>This is not equality . You are using the letter of the law to twist the purpose of the law , and even then doing it using very shaky logic . Equality is about general concepts , not specifics . It is equality to say ' everyone is has the same right to worship who they want ' , it is not equality to say ' everyone has the same right to worship who we tell them to ' . That is equality within an unequal system , which cannot be counted . Can you re-phrase , I don't follow . No . As I said , those have strong links to criminal activity irrespective of the act itself being a crime . For example drug use has noted links to theft , the same just cannot be said for homosexuality . No it isn't . And even if it was , that has nothing to do with homosexuality anyway . Physical or psychological injury or damage . Homosexuality is therefore in no way harmful . And I have serous doubts about the ' many ' who say it is . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Equality is treating every person the same . However it does not mean treating every person's behavior the same . It does not mean treat every organization the same either . Everyone has the same rights . NOt every religous practice , ideology , or behavior get the same treatment . Teh people determine what is in the public's interest to protect and ban . It basically only the Christian practices that are completely legal . Islamic polgamy and other religons don't have their practices recognized as often as christianity . Homosexuality has strong links to sodomy . Also prostitution is legal in Nevada so shoudl all states be forced to allow taht behavior ? Insome states adults cann have sex wiht 14 - 16 yr olds in some cases . Should other states recognize that too ? Most serial killers of men and young boys were homosexuals . Sodomy is a crime do you wnat me to post it ? gynocologist , Gi specialists , and colon specialist have all stated the effects homosexual related activites . Also there is a higher risk of disease transmission among homosexual men so much so they are not allowed to donate blood for 5 yrs from their last activity .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>178<br>S1 claims that laws are based on morals and because the United States is a predominantly Christian nation, the laws are going to be biased toward Christian beliefs.

He brings up the issue of equality, claiming that different religions are not actually equal even though the law says they should all be treated equally because although each of the religions has the same rights, they are still not all treated equally.
S2 rejects S1's differentiation between the right to believe and the right to behave and says it is inappropriate to compare homosexuality to non-consensual behaviors.

I will make one point here . Heterosexual marriage is one of the most universal of all human institutions , found in almost all cultures ever existing . With a precedent like that , the question isn't , " Why Mr. Galton are you opposed to gay marriage ? " The question is how do you justify revolutionizing that ancient institution ? To me , heterosexual marriage is the Parthenon : ancient , beautiful , crumbling some of late , but it would be a tragedy to knock it down , clear it out , and put in a new building . You prove to me why that new building is so gotdamn necessary .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It is circular to say marriage has simply always been heterosexual , end of debate . No one is talking about knocking down marriage . Gay families want to enter into it , because they want their families strengthened and protected as heterosexual families have been strenghtened and protected . Gay families want into the institution because they want to be a positive influence on it , to support it and to shore it up , not because they desire to harm it . They are fighting to get into it , as some heterosexuals can't wait to get out of it . I can't see if it would make such a dramatic change just because the couple are the same sex . Also marriage in the U.S. and Canada falls under common-law . This is a " living law " meant to evolve with society , with much room for interpretation by judges . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You're gonna have to explain your circularity argument for us slow folks . And you're gonna have to back up your statement that gays as a group are really in their hearts conservatives , with a love of traditional institutions like marriage . I strongly suspect that you have some homosexuals who want the right to marriage for romantic reasons , some who want it for economic / legal privilege reasons , but also very many who want it so as to affirm that homosexuality is just as good as heterosexuality . It's the idea of we're just as good as you are , so we must be able to have everything you can have . For many , I suspect it is not a desire to adopt a more conservative lifestyle , but to make a point , and move the culture toward greater acceptance . This is a risky gamble to shove this down peoples ' throats as it may cause a backlash instead of greater legitimization of the lifestyle . Oh and you've got to be kidding me that gay marriage doesn't revolutionize marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Takes us back to where we started , assumes it absolutely must be and cannot be different or change . Sure , there are many who want acceptance from society , parents , friends , and that is a big reason why they marry , for gays or straights . If gays want their marriages to compete with heterosexual marriages , to prove gay marriages can be more successful , wouldn't that be good for the institution ? The old fashioned backlash argument is not a reason to not do something , and frankly is a little tired and worn-out in 2004 . Gays are just as good as you are . Is there a problem with gays believing and acting like they are just as good ? We don't have the strong sense of different gender roles we once had , so why is it such a revolutionary change ? I can't see that it has revolutionized the societies where it is in effect . It could have represented the next step in a very gradual continuation of acceptance that had been going on for a long time . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I am not arguing that heterosexual marriage must be as it has been or cannot be different . I am arguing that that revolutionizing such an important , ancient institution requires some heavy justification . People who have no respect for the past may not find my point compelling ; people who look to the past with deep respect and see in it old wisdom will find it compelling . I for one do not want to revolutionize an ancient institution I have great respect for , in order so the gay community can prove something . Tired argument ?! My god , how long have we been debating gay marriage ? Only four or five years ago in grad school , we were discussing how difficult it would be to see more and more rights to be extended to cohabiting gays couples , and we talked a little bit about gay civil unions . Marriage wasn't even on the damn table ! Homosexuality is an eccentricity ; in my mind it is not equal in value to heterosexuality . This is not an issue of how gays believe and act ; it is an issue of whether we are going to enshrine homosexual marriage as we do with heterosexual marriage . Gender , sexuality , and family organization are absolutely fundamental aspects of society -- always have been , always will be .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes , the hetero-only definition of marriage has been around a long time . However , simply because something is traditional does not make it just . Well that's how you see it because of your contempt for the gay community . You see it as " them " trying to step out of their lower place , or prove they are not lower than you and equal in value . Your last comment I've dealt with in this post , demonstrates that very well . Yes , the backlash threat is tired and boring . No one is listening anymore . Well , I remember people talking about marriage for gays and lesbians and their rights for much longer . Well , that says it all about where you are coming from . You believe homosexuals are human beings of lesser value . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I believe homosexual behavior is an eccentricity and not equal in value to heterosexuality . I was not referring to the value of persons ; I think homosexuals have as much intrinsic value as anyone else . I have contempt for no one . Your attempt to paint people who disagree with you as haters is unfair and a cheap debate tactic .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Homosexuals are persons who have homosexual behaviour . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>We are all sophisticated enough to separate behavior from person . I don't have to tell you that homosexuals are MUCH more than whom they prefer to sleep with .<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Yes , there is also homosexual orientation , which is part of the person's homosexual identity , and part of the person's homosexuality . The orientation leads to the behaviour .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>178<br>S1 claims that traditional, heterosexual marriage is a universal human institution existing in almost every culture across the Earth and compares traditional marriage to the Parthenon as an example of an ancient structure that is damaged but deserves to be preserved. He claims that some homosexual unions would occur simply to demonstrate that homosexuality is equal to heterosexuality and that it is acceptable. He argues that it is not totally unacceptable to revise the definition of marriage, but that there would need to be a very good reason to do so, and that homosexuality is simply an eccentricity that is not equal in value to heterosexuality. 

S2 argues that claiming that marriage has always been heterosexual is circular logic. He asserts that legalizing homosexual marriage wouldn't damage heterosexual marriages, but it would allow homosexual couples to receive the rights and protections currently afforded only to heterosexual couples.  He argues that just because something is traditional does not guarantee that it is right.

Indeed , the state and federal laws on the issue are specifically directed against gay people . It is woefully disingenuous of you to pretend otherwise . Another case of malicious disingenuity . Not even you can take it seriously with a straight face that these laws don't exist because gay people insist on equal rights , and homophobes want to deny them .

I certainly can and there is nothing saying they can't within the restrictions by the law . Perhaps you don't . Let's look at marriage as an example . Marriage restrictions based on age , sex , species , number of , capacity , and perhaps a few other things . If you want " equal protection " the way you define it then all of these restrictions ( short of capacity ) would have to be removed . Is this what you mean by equal protection ? There seems to be more that disagree with you but that is beside the point . The only way you get to equal protection meaning what you want it to mean is if you evolve the constitution to a new meaning .

He says that heterosexuals take the right to marry the person you love for granted and should extend the same right to people in homosexual relationships. 
S2 reasserts his claim that it is illegitimate to misinterpret the original constitutional meaning of equal protection. He claims that true equality would require relaxing the marriage restrictions based on age and species, for example, which he suggests would be inappropriate. He claims that homosexuals are not being denied the right to marry because they are gay, but rather because the genders of the two people involved to not fit the criteria for marriage.

Certainly , you may argue that contracts drawn by a paid attorney or myself could reap these same benefits , but I do not understand what legitimate reason my family must jump through these hoops when heterosexual headed households are not required , asked or even expected to do the same . Two parents , two children , participating and supporting equally with our governments requirements as any other family , however receiving no reciprocation from the government to strengthen and protect my famly as It does heterosexual headed families .

Lets face it , it would be far harder for people to accept a complete revolution in what we consider to be an appropriate relationship to become an official family than to just allow gays to do it ... using the very arguments that gays have to justify them officially marrying we can justify most other type of marriage .

First , to assume that the majority of people in Ohio were either silent about their views on same-sex marriage or on their choice for president is utter nonsense .

Your implications that there is some " silent majority " imply a misunderstanding of the political battlefield , and I hope I have been able to clear it up . Next , although Bush won by a larger margin than Bill Clinton ( who you term " slick Willie " for no other reason than to anger and insult his supporters , I assume ? ) , this does not mean that Clinton did not win by a larger percentage .

He attributes this loss to the disapproval of homosexuality by Ohioans, as indicated by the passing of a gay marriage amendment and their support for President Bush who he claims won by a larger margin than President Clinton. S2 rejects the claim that the people of Ohio were silent about their views of same-sex marriage and claims that although President Bush won with a larger margin, President Clinton still won by a larger percentage, due to the increased population and larger voter turnout in President Bush's election. S1 claims that population is irrelevant, citing several statistics showing a low level of support for President Clinton, and also claims that the same-sex marriage issue definitely had an effect on the outcome of the Ohio election. S2 again responds with statistics showing that President Clinton won by larger percentages than President Bush. He does not deny that the same-sex marriage issue was relevant, but denies that there was a silent majority.<br><b> key:   </b>1-6646_6_5__7_10_11_12_17_20_3 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Indeed protesting made a difference , but it didn't happen until enough people came on board . All the protesting in the world wouldn't have brought it about if the will of the people were not changing to make it happen . At the end of the day , any legislative movement needs the will of the people to be successful . It may not need a full majority in some cases , but it needs enough people on board . That's why legislation requires not only voting ( by legislature ) , but elected officials to do so as well . There was a process our country went through on those issues as whether or not they were legitimate in terms of the law -- it involved a national debate , protests , etc. Sometimes this process results in our country ( the people ) granting civil rights legislation , and sometimes it doesn't ( depending on whether it is deemed warranted ) . The process ( which will undoubtedly take years ) is going on right now in regards to gays . Time will tell what the result will be . Any form of legislation is a voting matter . That's the way our system works .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why is it that whenever this comes up you insist on conflating " the people voting on a law " with " the legislature voting on a law " or " the people electing politicians " ? Why can't you simply discuss the topic at hand ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>In what way do you feel it is not the issue at hand ? Matthew asked about voting on his civil rights and this is all part of the voting process .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>In exactly the way I just said . He asked about people voting on laws , not legislators voting on laws . Again , why can't you answer that question ; why do you feel that it's necessary to move the topic around ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Fair enough ; but regardless , the point still stands -- people voting on laws is indeed allowed under our system . ( Ballot initiatives . ) It is all part of the process I mentioned to Matthew of society determining its standards . If you have a beef with the people being able to work toward determining our society's standards ( through voting on such issues ) , then if I were you I'd take it up with the govt .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Or we could take it up here , like Matthew did , and discuss it . Or at least try to , and hope someone doesn't derail the conversation into irrelevant issues like how the legislature works . I will echo the point that several have made here . The idea of allowing the masses to determine civil rights is stupid and wrong . If a group's civil rights need protecting , then they need protecting from the very masses that are doing the voting . Ballot measures may be a legal process , but that doesn't prevent them from being stupid and wrong , now does it ? That's the point that's trying to be made here . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well , that's up to you . If you don't want to derail it , you don't have to . It seems to me that what is really happening in society with these ballot initiatives and other parts of the process is determining whether or not it is a civil right in the first place to give legal marriage to whatever group arrangement is in question . ( In this case , gays couples . ) That process has to take place ; it is just not feasible in our society to give marriage equality to any group of any arrangement that comes along demanding it until we determine for certain that it needs to be done . If society determines that same-sex arrangements of two people should suffice to redefine marriage for it to be included , then so be it . But that process has to be there in some form , realistically . If you are going to draw the line in terms of what can be voted on a ballot initiative or not , what authority determines that ? How are you going to determine where that line is drawn ? And you can't just arbitrarily say " when civil rights are being infringed " because that doesn't carry any legal weight -- it's opinion . Just saying it's " stupid " and " wrong " may be your point being made , but it's a point that doesn't offer any solutions .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You really are a piece of work . All you're saying here is that if society wants to be bigoted it should be allowed to be . Very libertarian of you , but I believe that if the power of the government can be used to fight evil and prejudice , it should . If wrong is happening , and the government can stop it , it should . You will of course claim that the government can't do anything , but history has proven that position wrong . The government has taken stands against biggotry before , and while it hasn't eradicated it , it has improved things . Gee , now I'm supposed to offer solutions before you even get what the point is ? I'm I allowed to use both hands while I type ? Any other restrictions you want to add ?<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>178<br>S1 claims that any legislative movement requires the support of the people to be successful. He suggests that the legal decisions about important issues involve not just the legislature, but national debates and protests. He argues that this same process is now occurring over gay rights and that people voting on laws is how the legal system works in order to allow society to determine its own standards. He claims that there is no problem with marriage being redefined to include same-sex couples, but that this change of definition must occur through the official process. 
S2 accuses S1 of shifting off topic to the voting process and how the legislature works, claiming that the legal intricacies are irrelevant. He claims that allowing the general public to determine civil rights is wrong and that if a group needs protecting it is the government's job to do so, citing instances in the past where the government has taken a stand against bigotry. He argues that just because something is currently legal doesn't mean that it isn't wrong.<br><br><b>worker_id </b>A2TMWYLZY40I9<br>HITid:</b>  3GV1I4SEO9PJPD68AHLYL6CA5X3L6X<br> <b>Status:</b>Approved<br><b> key:   </b>1-5672_18_7__22_24_25_29_30_33_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Yes it does , because what is happening here is that ' family ' and ' marriage ' are being redefined .

Can you describe the hand gestures that went with that ?<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>180<br>S1 claims that legalizing same-sex marriage requires redefining family and marriage and that it would affect traditional marriage. He references a person named Colson who believes that same-sex households are deficient compared to heterosexual households in the same way that a single-parent household is deficient compared to a two-parent household. There is nothing inherently wrong with the deficient family systems, but they are not ideal. S1 notes that he does sometimes agree with gay rights supporters, for example, believing that the constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage is a bad idea, that homosexuals do experience violence and harassment, and that homosexuals should not be discriminated against when it comes to adoption, housing, or employment. 

S2 rejects the comparison of same-sex households to single-parent households by noting that there is not a constitutional amendment to ban single-parenthood. He claims that S1's inconsistent arguments in favor of and against same-sex marriage make it doubtful whether he actually does support gay rights, and he suggests that it is possible that S1 is being paid to post on the forum.<br><b> key:   </b>1-5672_6_5__7_13_15_16_17_20_2 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Actually , I think it's probably the most compelling argument I've read for the amendment .

So do you believe the basis of what he's claiming ? And are you ready to debate it ? Because there is no " overall effect on society and traditional family " from gay marriage . The " traditional family " has been having its OWN problems , and has been in decline in these countries LONG BEFORE gay marriage ever was legalized . It's like a guy jumping out of an airplane , and he starts falling to the ground . Three seconds later gay marriage is legalized , and conservatives want to blame the fact that he's falling on gay marriage ... It makes no sense . There is no causality here ... Do straight people say , " Hey ! Gay marriage is legal . I don't want to get married now . " Do straight people say , " Hey ! Gay marriage is legal . I want to get a divorce now . " The " most compelling argument " lacks any semblance of sense . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes it does , because what is happening here is that ' family ' and ' marriage ' are being redefined .

I don't see how you can say that it DOES have an effect on that . Tell me , for starters , WHAT effect it will happen . Will Colson get a divorce if gay marriage is legalized ? Will Colson wish he had never gotten married if gay marriage is legalized ? THEY are claiming SPECIFIC effects . NEGATIVE effects . Effects that should be PROVEN for them to be claimed ... HOW can they claim those SPECIFIC DETRIMENTAL effects from gay marriage onto OTHER PEOPLE's marriages ??? Where's the proof ? 1 ) Studies DO back-up the issue of " single vs dual parent house-holds " . And that is common sense . Two heads are better than one . Twice the capability to care . 2 ) Studies REFUTE the claims that dual heterosexual parents are better than dual gay parents . They aren't . Gay parents are just as good . The gender of the parents are irrelevant . The sexual orientation of the parents is irrelevant . Where did I misrepresent something Jyoshu ?

I would think if Colson's point was to lay blame for crime he would have simply said so . He didn't . Colson is simply opposing thge amendment because he believes that traditional families are best in terms of avoiding crime . I don't really agree either -- I think there are too many variables for that to automatically be the case .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Oh . I see . So if somebody said " Christianity causes cancer " , that would be a compelling argument for people to not be Christians . Right ? Give me a freakin ' break Jyoshu . READ the article .

It makes claims that : 1 ) Gay marriage will cause detriment to straight marriages . 2 ) Detriment to straight marriages , e.g. single parent families , yield greater instances of criminals . It's all right there . In plain English . I am making no " inference " . This IS what the author is saying . Then explain to me his next paragraph where he links LEGALIZATION of gay marriage to a decrease in " traditional families " . Can't you put two and two together ? And Colson is not " opposing " the amendment . He's SUPPORTING it . From the article : " This is just one reason that I am so passionately in favor of the Marriage Protection Amendment ...

He also claims that Colson believes that traditional families have the best outcomes in regards to criminal behavior of offspring. 

S2 rejects the claim that same-sex marriage has a negative effect on society, suggesting that traditional marriage was on the decline long before same-sex marriage was ever legalized.

He also claims that once same-sex marriage is legalized, it is possible that straight men will marry each other in order to gain some unspecified advantages.
S2 asserts that the argument currently being discussed is regarding marriage, not sexual behaviors of married couples.

If you don't follow the rules you don't qualify for the benefits . The fact that thereare rules does not mean anyone is barred from the custom .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And those rules used to include race as a qualifier for marriage . Neither blacks nor whites were allowed to marry outside of their race . Rights were applied equally based upon the confines of this criteria . If whom you wanted to marry fell outside of this criteria you were not allowed to wed . This is the same principal you are using to show equal rights amongst hetero and homo sexual people . The only difference is that as it stands now race has been removed from the criteria as it was viewed to be inappropriate and discriminatory . The gay marriage proponents are now advocating that gender be removed from the same criteria as it is also inappropriate and discriminatory . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Except they were demonstratably unequal . A black person could not marry those that a white person could marry , and white people were barred from marriage to those that black people were not barred from . Currently , there is no barrier that homosexual people have that heterosexual people do not share . The two situations are dissimilar . As long as there are any rules , this will be true . No-one may marry someone already married , an animal , a minor , or a sibling . There is nothing wrong with trying to change the status quo , but you don't have a right to the changes you want . They are just changes you want .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Yes , the qualifying criteria for marriage at the time was unequal which is why race was removed from criteria . But anyone who wanted to get married had to meet this criteria which was applied to everyone . This is the same argument that you are using to prove that there is no inequality between hetrosexuals and homosexuals . Yes , there is . A heterosexual couple can get married . A homosexual couple cannot . Your objection is a semantic one . Admittedly , no one has the right to marriage . But again I will reiterate . That is not the issue . The issue is homosexual couples cannot get married while heterosexual couples can . In so doing the government recognizes the heterosexual couple as significant members of the same family and award that couple benefits which include the ability to visit one another in a hospital , the ability to make impotortant life decisions if one of the members should become incompasitated , the ability to cover one another under their insurance , the ability to file taxes jointly , the ability to purchase property together and survivorship rights of said property , inheritance rights , and many others . These priveleges are being denied to homosexual couples . Not people , couples . They are being denied the above privelges not because the don't deserve them but because some people don't like the idea of them having sex . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not the criteria . The effect . Except that neither the qualifying criteria nor the effect is unequal between heterosexual and homosexual individuals . True , but couples do not have rights , individuals do . Agreed . I think it's more complicated than that , but that is essentially so . Heterosexual relationships are perceived as somehow more valid or as having a purpose that homosexual relationships lack . This is true ( if " purpose " is the right word ) on an evolutionary level , so the view has some validity . Of course , that should have no automatic policy implications but it would explain some of the resistance to the idea .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Agreed . Rights may not be the correct word . But there are benefits that heterosexual couples can obtain and homosexual couples cannot . Agreed . The bolded part of your post is the basis of gay marriage proponents . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The problem is that acquiring these marriage benefits depends on how people view that type of relationship .

At least that's what this article suggests : Opponents of gay marriage use many of the same arguments as foes of interracial relationships did before Loving v . Virginia outlawed state bans on interracial marriage in 1967 , said law professor Kim Forde-Mazrui at a talk sponsored by the Center for the Study of Race and Law and Lambda Law Alliance Sept . 30 . http://www.law.virginia.edu/home2002...fall/forde.htm<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This is not relevant to my argument at all . I have mentioned nothing about religious beliefs or bible-thumping protests against homosexuality . I did not bring interacial marriage into the discussion because it does not apply . I'm not against interacial marriage as long as there's a man and a woman involved . I did not bring the silly argument about water fountains into the discussion . Separate-but-equal does apply in the sense that records of legally recognized couples would separate married couples from same-sex couples but would not justify any inequalities regarding their rights and privileges . Hospital visitation , inheritance and other things could be afforded both . I'm wondering if those who insist on same-sex couples being called " married " are not acting somewhat from self-imposed shame ... like you want to hide the fact that you are gay . My argument has thusfar been limited to the requirement to redefine several other words if we redefine " marriage " . It has nothing to do with homophobia which , by the way , I do not suffer from . I have some friends that are gay and they know how I feel about the word " marriage " . We remain friends . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I accept your argument at face value , although I will say that I believe that the majority of people who argue against gay marriage do so for religious or homophobe reasons . ( Again , I'm not saying you fall into these categories . ) Words get redefined all the time , and some of them are just as important as the word ' marriage ' . For example , the Iraq War is not technically a war -- congress never declared war . And this isn't just a semantic detail , either . Declaring war used to mean that congress committed , the president committed , and all the citizens made sacrifices for the cause . Now we initiate military operations , never declare war in order to allow political wiggle room , cut everyone's taxes , tell them to go shopping , and call it a war anyway . Now that's redefining a word . Substituting a Jack for a Jill on a marriage license seems pretty minor in comparison to me .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The invasion of Iraq was a resumption of warfare that ended in a cease fire . It was not technically a new war requiring all the congressional steps . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not to derail this thread -- we can talk about this more in the Politics section -- but the last time the US Congress declared war was for WWII . So the conflict in Iraq is not in fact a resumption of a prior declared war .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're technically correct . However , the Gulf War was approved by Congress whether it was a declared war or not . The Iraq War was a continuation of the same conflict after a cease fire . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I understand the Bush administration has made this argument , but I don't think it has a whole lot of merit . It was a different presidential administration and the reasons for the conflict were different -- to repel the invasion of Kuwait . Not to mention that the same logical argument could be used to begin a fresh invasion of Vietnam or Korea .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I think not . Those conflicts ended in something other than a cease fire .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>92<br>S1 states that many of the same arguments against gay marriage today were made against interracial marriage. Many of the people who argue against it do so for religious or homophobic reasons. The definitions of words like marriage can be changed by society, just as the definition of war has changed.
S2 is not against interracial marriage as long as it's between a man and a woman. The same rights can be afforded gay couples without calling it marriage and S2 doesn't believe that marriage needs to be redefined.<br><b> key:   </b>1-5811_33_29__35_38_40_41_43_2 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Don't you think that in 1909 it was probably viewed mostly from a moral standpoint ? I don't think they saw it the same way they would see black people . They didn't even realize that ' homosexuality ' was any sort of innate thing . It was entirely behavioral to them . I tend to agree with the court , even given what you've said . I doubt for 1909 it was about prejudice and bigotry -- they genuinely felt it was wrong . The concept of gay marriage was completely foreign and unknown in 1909 . It wasn't even something they conceived of . I think the court is saying that they couldn't have been prejudiced against something they didn't even know of or conceive of .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Hogwash . It was once entirely moral to believe certain races were inferior , and that women had fewer rights than men . Treating the races and women as equal was not something even thought of by many . It was prejudice against gays then , and it still is today . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>This is not really true . It's a popular misconstruing of morality and history by proponents of modern ' rights ' movements , but it's not true . There's little historical backing to the idea that people believed oppressing black people was a right thing to do , as in , doing good . There were times they used an argument where religion was wrongly used to justify their behavior , but that's a different matter . If you firmly believe otherwise , I'd challenge you to show where people thought oppressing blacks was an example if doing good . The same goes for misogyny . Furthermore , it's beside the point anyway . We're talking about homosexuality . In 1909 , the only thing they really understood about the issue at hand was that some people engaged in sexual relations with people of their own gender . There were no articles about " homosexuality " as a trait , and certainly none about genetic causes . It was understood entirely from a behavioral standpoint , and therefore a moral standpoint . So it's not hogwash at all -- they really did view gay sex as immoral . If you don't think so , then you have a very poor grasp on history in this case .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This kind of morality is based on nothing but ignorance ( which you admit ) and prejudice . What kind of a basis is that for a so-called moral code ? So what if it involves behaviour ? Gay people have sex , develop relationships , and bond , just like everyone else , but in a way that reflects their gay sexuality . This does not mean people could not be prejudiced about the way gay people live . People were , and are so prejudiced . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>A better reverse analogy would have been to say " So then conversly I have the right to advocate that heterosexual relations are morally wrong " . Not heterosexuality , since it's not homosexuality ( as it's a state of being ) that religious people have a problem with . Heck , they often don't even recognize it . With that caveat , yes you are certainly free to advocate whatever you want to be morally wrong . ( And unlike the way some in your movement do , I won't call you a " bigot " for doing so ! ) It may have been based on " ignorance " , but I reject the notion it was based on prejudice ( and therefore I tend to agree with the 6 - 0 view of the justices here ) . The 1909 society had too little understanding of gay people to be prejudiced over in the first place . Remember , homosexuality was not understood as a state of being at that time . The term itself had not been around long and was not known to most people . And even to those it was known to , it was not known as a state of being . And there certainly was no social identity among gay people as a group -- how could prejudice have existed if there was nothing ( from their perspective ) to be prejudiced toward ?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Right . Provided gays don't live gay , but live straight , gays can be as gay as they want . As long as gays don't outwardly show what makes them different from straights , gays can be as gay as they want . It's bs . Also some may not recognize the existence of gay people or their gay lives , but that is putting one's head in the sand . Nonsense . People would widely and hatefully use the term " sodomite " to refer to gays . Before that the term was " molly " . Clearly there was an identity they were prejudiced towards . They were rounding up gays in areas they were known to attend , and putting them in prison . Read up on the trial of Oscar Wilde . Gays may have been forced underground , to a greater extent , but that does not mean they were not thought of . Gays were just not thought of in a nice way . Gays were purposely kept out of everything in society , when society didn't really think of gays as human too . That isn't prejudice ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Because they didn't approve of sodomy ! Do you not agree they didn't understand the concept of homosexuality ??? There was no social identity . When they were put on trial , it wasn't because they were gay ( which they had no concept of ) , it was because they had gay relations which society viewed as wrong ! No , here's where you don't get it -- it's not that " gays " ( there was no concept of that ) were purposely kept out of of everything , it's that people who had sodomy relationships were kept out of everything , because sodomy was viewed as wrong . They really did think it was wrong ! You are so determined to portray everything that has anything to do with gay relations possibly being wrong as prejudice and bigotry that you are close-minded about it .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>74<br>S1 doesn't believe people in the past were prejudiced against homosexuals because it was a behavior then, not an identity.

I didn't bring up religon in my argument . Jake did . So please don't specualte anything until you knwo what we're talking about . All laws are based upon morals .

My definition of negative effect is that the puposes for which something is created is hindered or compromises . By changing standards there is a harm to it's integrity . Intregrity is compromised when it isn't stable . Soemthing that changes all teh time loses that integrity like John Kerry on his views . Things must remain consistent to be integral . This argument has a flaw . That when there is guaranteed religous freedomw then we dont ' have equal rights . Everyone has equal rights in terms of believing . However behavior is regualted by the government . Therefore we can do anyting in the name of religion until it violates behavior that is acceptable by society .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Fine , so what if the government said people are free to ' believe ' in God , but any sign of them putting their belief into practice , such as going to church or even just praying in private was illegal ? Would that be acceptable ? After all it is just regulating behaviourA , not belief ? Your comparisons are ludicrous . All of these situations involve non-consensual acts either through lack of knowledge or involvement of minors . You cannot compare that to consensual acts between adults . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That probably wouldn't be acceptable to most people but it would be legal and equal . They don't allow religious practices of polygamy , animal or human sacrifices , body mutilation , and many other religious practices . So then we should allow prostitution , polygamy , human trafficking , drug trafficking , gambling , drug distribution , and all other consensual acts .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But they obviously wouldn't be equal , because a significant proportion of the population would be restricted from worshipping how they want in a for that hurts nobody . These elements mostly have links to crime over and above the act itself , that justifies restrictions . Homosexuality doesn't . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The poeple would be equal . The religions would not . Look at our country . Almost all Christian beleifs are legal and no other non-Christians Churches have almost all their legal beleifs . That's it ? Crime ? That's it . The criminal link ? So if they criminalized homosexuality then it would be okay to ban gay marriage . Homosexuality has links to crime too . Sodomy is a crime . Define harm becaue homosexuality is harmful according to many .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>This is not equality . You are using the letter of the law to twist the purpose of the law , and even then doing it using very shaky logic . Equality is about general concepts , not specifics . It is equality to say ' everyone is has the same right to worship who they want ' , it is not equality to say ' everyone has the same right to worship who we tell them to ' . That is equality within an unequal system , which cannot be counted . Can you re-phrase , I don't follow . No . As I said , those have strong links to criminal activity irrespective of the act itself being a crime . For example drug use has noted links to theft , the same just cannot be said for homosexuality . No it isn't . And even if it was , that has nothing to do with homosexuality anyway . Physical or psychological injury or damage . Homosexuality is therefore in no way harmful . And I have serous doubts about the ' many ' who say it is . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Equality is treating every person the same . However it does not mean treating every person's behavior the same . It does not mean treat every organization the same either . Everyone has the same rights . NOt every religous practice , ideology , or behavior get the same treatment . Teh people determine what is in the public's interest to protect and ban . It basically only the Christian practices that are completely legal . Islamic polgamy and other religons don't have their practices recognized as often as christianity . Homosexuality has strong links to sodomy . Also prostitution is legal in Nevada so shoudl all states be forced to allow taht behavior ? Insome states adults cann have sex wiht 14 - 16 yr olds in some cases . Should other states recognize that too ? Most serial killers of men and young boys were homosexuals . Sodomy is a crime do you wnat me to post it ? gynocologist , Gi specialists , and colon specialist have all stated the effects homosexual related activites . Also there is a higher risk of disease transmission among homosexual men so much so they are not allowed to donate blood for 5 yrs from their last activity .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>88<br>S1 contends that all laws are based on morals.

S2 states that equality wthin an inequal system is not right. Comparing non-consensual acts to homosexuality, which is consensual acts between adults, is not right either. Homosexuality is in no way harmful and not equivalent to crimes.<br><b> key:   </b>1-1281_132_130_1_134_135_136_138_139_140_141_142_12 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>I only have limited time to debate , so I have to pick my battles , so I'll pass on this one . I will make one point here . Heterosexual marriage is one of the most universal of all human institutions , found in almost all cultures ever existing . With a precedent like that , the question isn't , " Why Mr. Galton are you opposed to gay marriage ? " The question is how do you justify revolutionizing that ancient institution ? To me , heterosexual marriage is the Parthenon : ancient , beautiful , crumbling some of late , but it would be a tragedy to knock it down , clear it out , and put in a new building . You prove to me why that new building is so gotdamn necessary .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It is circular to say marriage has simply always been heterosexual , end of debate . No one is talking about knocking down marriage . Gay families want to enter into it , because they want their families strengthened and protected as heterosexual families have been strenghtened and protected . Gay families want into the institution because they want to be a positive influence on it , to support it and to shore it up , not because they desire to harm it . They are fighting to get into it , as some heterosexuals can't wait to get out of it . I can't see if it would make such a dramatic change just because the couple are the same sex . Also marriage in the U.S. and Canada falls under common-law . This is a " living law " meant to evolve with society , with much room for interpretation by judges . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You're gonna have to explain your circularity argument for us slow folks . And you're gonna have to back up your statement that gays as a group are really in their hearts conservatives , with a love of traditional institutions like marriage . I strongly suspect that you have some homosexuals who want the right to marriage for romantic reasons , some who want it for economic / legal privilege reasons , but also very many who want it so as to affirm that homosexuality is just as good as heterosexuality . It's the idea of we're just as good as you are , so we must be able to have everything you can have . For many , I suspect it is not a desire to adopt a more conservative lifestyle , but to make a point , and move the culture toward greater acceptance . This is a risky gamble to shove this down peoples ' throats as it may cause a backlash instead of greater legitimization of the lifestyle . Oh and you've got to be kidding me that gay marriage doesn't revolutionize marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Takes us back to where we started , assumes it absolutely must be and cannot be different or change . Sure , there are many who want acceptance from society , parents , friends , and that is a big reason why they marry , for gays or straights . If gays want their marriages to compete with heterosexual marriages , to prove gay marriages can be more successful , wouldn't that be good for the institution ? The old fashioned backlash argument is not a reason to not do something , and frankly is a little tired and worn-out in 2004 . Gays are just as good as you are . Is there a problem with gays believing and acting like they are just as good ? We don't have the strong sense of different gender roles we once had , so why is it such a revolutionary change ? I can't see that it has revolutionized the societies where it is in effect . It could have represented the next step in a very gradual continuation of acceptance that had been going on for a long time . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I am not arguing that heterosexual marriage must be as it has been or cannot be different . I am arguing that that revolutionizing such an important , ancient institution requires some heavy justification . People who have no respect for the past may not find my point compelling ; people who look to the past with deep respect and see in it old wisdom will find it compelling . I for one do not want to revolutionize an ancient institution I have great respect for , in order so the gay community can prove something . Tired argument ?! My god , how long have we been debating gay marriage ? Only four or five years ago in grad school , we were discussing how difficult it would be to see more and more rights to be extended to cohabiting gays couples , and we talked a little bit about gay civil unions . Marriage wasn't even on the damn table ! Homosexuality is an eccentricity ; in my mind it is not equal in value to heterosexuality . This is not an issue of how gays believe and act ; it is an issue of whether we are going to enshrine homosexual marriage as we do with heterosexual marriage . Gender , sexuality , and family organization are absolutely fundamental aspects of society -- always have been , always will be .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes , the hetero-only definition of marriage has been around a long time . However , simply because something is traditional does not make it just . Well that's how you see it because of your contempt for the gay community . You see it as " them " trying to step out of their lower place , or prove they are not lower than you and equal in value . Your last comment I've dealt with in this post , demonstrates that very well . Yes , the backlash threat is tired and boring . No one is listening anymore . Well , I remember people talking about marriage for gays and lesbians and their rights for much longer . Well , that says it all about where you are coming from . You believe homosexuals are human beings of lesser value . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I believe homosexual behavior is an eccentricity and not equal in value to heterosexuality . I was not referring to the value of persons ; I think homosexuals have as much intrinsic value as anyone else . I have contempt for no one . Your attempt to paint people who disagree with you as haters is unfair and a cheap debate tactic .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Homosexuals are persons who have homosexual behaviour . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>We are all sophisticated enough to separate behavior from person . I don't have to tell you that homosexuals are MUCH more than whom they prefer to sleep with .<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Yes , there is also homosexual orientation , which is part of the person's homosexual identity , and part of the person's homosexuality . The orientation leads to the behaviour .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>95<br>S1 believes that heterosexual marriage is an ancient institution should be preserved. Gay marriage does revolutionize marriage. Though gay people may have various motives for getting married, including legal benefits, the real reason is to normalize gay behavior. Homosexuality is an eccentric behavior, though gay people are more than just who they sleep with.
S2 states that homosexuals have an orientation that leads to their behavior. Just because marriage has always been between heterosexuals doesn't mean that tradition is always right. There's nothing wrong with homosexuals wanting equal treatment and to normalize homosexuality.<br><b> key:   </b>1-7185_117_110__122_126_134_148_150_151_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>The court upheld equal protections . You accuse the court of illegitimate " judicial activism " for upholding such protections . Obviosly so far as you are concerned , if equal protections are upheld for gay Americans , it's illegitimate . Obviously not in the states that prohibit it . Can't you read the laws ? Indeed , the state and federal laws on the issue are specifically directed against gay people . It is woefully disingenuous of you to pretend otherwise . Another case of malicious disingenuity . Not even you can take it seriously with a straight face that these laws don't exist because gay people insist on equal rights , and homophobes want to deny them . If you don't know what equality means , by all means invest in a dictionary . Then you haven't much understanding of it . It applies to this case , and there are a large number of court decisions that agree with this understanding , this being just the latest . The straw men are all in your posts .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why can't you answer my question ? I simply said that it is illegitimate to say the constitution means one thing when it never has . I certainly can and there is nothing saying they can't within the restrictions by the law . Perhaps you don't . Let's look at marriage as an example . Marriage restrictions based on age , sex , species , number of , capacity , and perhaps a few other things . If you want " equal protection " the way you define it then all of these restrictions ( short of capacity ) would have to be removed . Is this what you mean by equal protection ? There seems to be more that disagree with you but that is beside the point . The only way you get to equal protection meaning what you want it to mean is if you evolve the constitution to a new meaning . If you can prove to me how gay marriage was part of the original meaning of the term " equal protection " then I'd be very much impressed . nice response Can you show me where I made a strawman ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Oh dear . I suppose I am extremely stupid in thinking that when a constitution says equal protections under the law , it means equal protections under the law . Evidently , it means : " Except gays " .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Can you show a document that suggests the original meaning of " equal protection " means equality for gays but not for other groups ? If you like I can explain the original understanding of the 14th amendment and how it wouldn't apply to gays unless they were denied marriage as defined today for being gay . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Can you show us a document that shows equality applies to groups other than gays ? Where does the Constitution say , " Except gays " ? Do you seriously imagine gay people want to marry the opposite sex ? Do you seriously think it is not an obstacle to their pursuit of life , liberty and happiness to prevent them from marrying the partners they love ? After all , you folk take your right to marry the consenting adults you love for granted , but for some pig-headed reason , you think it's OK to deny gay Americans the same rights you have . And you think that's constitutional ? Steve , that's bigotry .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are borderline breaking the rules of the forum . That aside , did you want me to explain the meaning of equal protection or not ? If it makes you feel better I wouldn't think it was denial of equal protection if marriage was denied as two men or two women marrying each other . No , they can't marry each other . Not sure how that is protection but if it is then consider gays protected too . I'm not saying you should think the way I do but at least I am trying to answer your questions and respond to your points . All you seem to be doing is ignoring my posts and insulting me . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>yawn . But since that is the denial of equal rights , obviously you would be wrong to think that . Nope . A very disingenuous argument . Gay partnerships are NOT protected the same way as straight ones -- in many places , they are illegal . That would be obvious even to a blind man , but not to someone deliberately denying the facts . I am pointing out that your opinions are wrong . As to why you make the erroneous arguments you do , i can only surmise .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No because in that case everyone is still allowed to marry under what marriage means . so is a daughter and father relationship which was the topic at hand ... Why are they wrong ? Why can't you explain why denial of some things that aren't equal is ok and doesn't violate equal protection but with gay marriage it does ? It is this question that makes or breaks your entire argument .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>102<br>S1 states that the court has upheld equal rights. Preventing gay people from marrying those they love is a denial of their Constitutional rights. Thinking otherwise is bigotry and denying that gay partnerships are treated inequally is a denial of the facts.
S2 doesn't understand why incestous relationship wouldn't be allowed under those rights, if that's what makes some people happy. Why is gay marriage an exception? There are restrictions on marriage based on gender, age and capacity and those don't violate the law. Gay people have the right to marry, they just can't marry people of the same gender.<br><br><b>worker_id </b>A2JWVE2I8JGFPN<br>HITid:</b>  3Z3R5YC0P3N3RJ7OKJQT13Z4S9SFTX<br> <b>Status:</b>Rejected<br><b> key:   </b>1-10073_119_44__120_124_127_129_130_131_132_133_134_6 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>I really wish that you would read my posts before commenting .

Are you more deserving than a single parent that deliberately has a clutch of children then moans because of lack of government support ?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>With full civil marriage equality , a whole host of benefits are brought about to strengthen my family such as survivors benefits for social security as just one example . Another example would be my husband , given that marriage equality were a reality , would automatically gain guardianship of our children were anything to happen to me . These of course are only a couple of the more than a thousand benefits marriage brings about . Certainly , you may argue that contracts drawn by a paid attorney or myself could reap these same benefits , but I do not understand what legitimate reason my family must jump through these hoops when heterosexual headed households are not required , asked or even expected to do the same . Two parents , two children , participating and supporting equally with our governments requirements as any other family , however receiving no reciprocation from the government to strengthen and protect my famly as It does heterosexual headed families . And no , I am certainly not more deserving than anyone else . We do not nor have not ever asked for a handout of any kind anymore than saying that a heterosexual headed household is asking for a handout when the parents are married . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>As you pointed out , it is only heterosexual couples that get to marry and reap the benefits from it . In a modern secular society there is no reason not to extend marriage to other forms of relationships . However just extending marriage to gay couples is not enough , it must be extended to all permutations of sexual relationships and society must look at sexual relationships that are otherwise banned . I cannot see why marriage should be granted to you but an incestuous relationship be illegal . Making homosexual sex legal is a far cry to making gay relationships officially equal to hetero ones . You are no ' better ' than two half brothers having a sexual relationship or a mother and son ..o r indeed a polygamous gay relationship ... it all deviates from the present definition of marriage .

I dont see why gays should have their relationships officialised ( is that a word ? ) and pull up the ladder so other types of relationships cannot follow . Before gay marriage is allowed then all types of sexual relationships should be considered . Lets face it , it would be far harder for people to accept a complete revolution in what we consider to be an appropriate relationship to become an official family than to just allow gays to do it ... using the very arguments that gays have to justify them officially marrying we can justify most other type of marriage .

S2 feels that those different types of relationships are separate issues that would need to be debated separately. Marriage brings out legal benefits that would strengthen gay couples and their families, like death benefits and custody issues. Gay people should have the same benefits for their families as straight people.

First , to assume that the majority of people in Ohio were either silent about their views on same-sex marriage or on their choice for president is utter nonsense .

Your implications that there is some " silent majority " imply a misunderstanding of the political battlefield , and I hope I have been able to clear it up . Next , although Bush won by a larger margin than Bill Clinton ( who you term " slick Willie " for no other reason than to anger and insult his supporters , I assume ? ) , this does not mean that Clinton did not win by a larger percentage .

All the protesting in the world wouldn't have brought it about if the will of the people were not changing to make it happen . At the end of the day , any legislative movement needs the will of the people to be successful . It may not need a full majority in some cases , but it needs enough people on board . That's why legislation requires not only voting ( by legislature ) , but elected officials to do so as well . There was a process our country went through on those issues as whether or not they were legitimate in terms of the law -- it involved a national debate , protests , etc. Sometimes this process results in our country ( the people ) granting civil rights legislation , and sometimes it doesn't ( depending on whether it is deemed warranted ) . The process ( which will undoubtedly take years ) is going on right now in regards to gays . Time will tell what the result will be . Any form of legislation is a voting matter . That's the way our system works .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why is it that whenever this comes up you insist on conflating " the people voting on a law " with " the legislature voting on a law " or " the people electing politicians " ? Why can't you simply discuss the topic at hand ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>In what way do you feel it is not the issue at hand ? Matthew asked about voting on his civil rights and this is all part of the voting process .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>In exactly the way I just said .

Again , why can't you answer that question ; why do you feel that it's necessary to move the topic around ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Fair enough ; but regardless , the point still stands -- people voting on laws is indeed allowed under our system . ( Ballot initiatives . ) It is all part of the process I mentioned to Matthew of society determining its standards . If you have a beef with the people being able to work toward determining our society's standards ( through voting on such issues ) , then if I were you I'd take it up with the govt .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Or we could take it up here , like Matthew did , and discuss it . Or at least try to , and hope someone doesn't derail the conversation into irrelevant issues like how the legislature works . I will echo the point that several have made here . The idea of allowing the masses to determine civil rights is stupid and wrong . If a group's civil rights need protecting , then they need protecting from the very masses that are doing the voting . Ballot measures may be a legal process , but that doesn't prevent them from being stupid and wrong , now does it ? That's the point that's trying to be made here . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well , that's up to you . If you don't want to derail it , you don't have to . It seems to me that what is really happening in society with these ballot initiatives and other parts of the process is determining whether or not it is a civil right in the first place to give legal marriage to whatever group arrangement is in question . ( In this case , gays couples . ) That process has to take place ; it is just not feasible in our society to give marriage equality to any group of any arrangement that comes along demanding it until we determine for certain that it needs to be done . If society determines that same-sex arrangements of two people should suffice to redefine marriage for it to be included , then so be it . But that process has to be there in some form , realistically . If you are going to draw the line in terms of what can be voted on a ballot initiative or not , what authority determines that ? How are you going to determine where that line is drawn ? And you can't just arbitrarily say " when civil rights are being infringed " because that doesn't carry any legal weight -- it's opinion .

The government has taken stands against biggotry before , and while it hasn't eradicated it , it has improved things .

Love and reproduction are implied . The legal meaning of marriage is , in most States , a contract between two people who are not under the age of consent , of different genders , of the same species , not closely related and who are not already married . Homosexuals are not a part of the traditional or cultural meaning of marriage . In order to be included , the meaning of marriage would have to change . The catch-22 is that homosexual couples want to be included in the current meaning of marriage , but what gives marriage meaning specifically excludes homosexual couples .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That's your definition . It is certainly not my definition . You don't speak for all of society . I personally define marriage as a union of two people who love one another and wish to make a commitment to one another . If marriage is about reproduction , why does nobody bat an eye when a 65 year old woman marries a 68 year old man ? If you believe marriage is " formalization of a mating pair " , and " reproduction is implied " , doesn't this cheapen the institution of marriage in your eyes ? Obviously , they are not getting married to start a family ... perhaps love is what is important ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Mating pairs exist with or without marriage , and have no legal connection with marriage ( since , legally , it doesn't matter if the two people even like one another , or ever intend on consumating said marriage ) . The only connection between a mating couple and marriage is the connection made on a cultural level . So , logically , the cultural meaning of marriage would be the purpose of a mating couple . While ' purpose ' can mean different things , in this context I daresay most would refer to the evolutionary purpose of a mating couple : reproduction . Love is implied because love brings the couple together for that purpose . While legally a 27 yr old marrying a 70 yr old sugar daddy is not a problem , culturally speaking this marriage is not as meaningful as one that is in-line with the evolutionary purpose I outlined above . You can point to exceptions all you want , but all it does is outline the difference between the legal meaning and the cultural meaning of marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Who gave you the power to decide what is culturally meaningful ? And more importantly , should we legally define marriage based on your perception of " cultural meaning " ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No , you should legally define it any damn way you can get away with . The cultural definition comes from observation .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But who get's to decide that legal definition ... that's the point . In this specific case in point , the anti crowd wishes to limit the rights of others simply based on personally held beliefs ... when no harm is presented to any party involved . In a case such as this , I feel strongly that without a specific vector of harm , we must as a civilized society rule in favor of providing equal rights rather than limit rights of a minority . I think these 4 pages thus far make clear that cultural definition is based on subjective obeservation and personal opinion formed via that observation . Clearly , I and many others here do not share your cultural definition . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>In America the people generally vote on issues , or elect representatives to enact laws . That's how you change the legal definitions . This isn't about equality , snakespit . The title of this thread shows that :P In all seriousness , though , it really isn't about equality . I don't think you have a rational basis upon which to dispute that observation . It is an indisputible fact that the cultural view that has dominated this country ( as evidenced by the definition of marriage ) generally follows evolutionarily sound logic : monogamous pair bonding outside of close familial ties . Inclusion of homosexuals would obviously change that .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>87<br>S1 believes that procreation is the purpose of marriage. Homosexuals can't be included because it would change the meaning of marriage. The cultural definition of marriage can't be changed even if the law can be. 
S2 states that people against gay marriage want to legislate based on beliefs. Many people do no share the cultural definition of marriage as for procreation. For example, and older person married to a younger person may not have children but are still married in the eyes of the law.<br><b> key:   </b>1-10349_72_70__75_82_83_84_85_86_87_88_89_90_94_95_99_4 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>I'm speaking of everyone who lives in the society ... it's implicit that we agree to live by the laws of that society :P A social contract , if you will .

But it's based upon biology , which isn't an arbitrary difference .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>As long as 70 year olds are allowed to marry then you have lost that arguement .

You've also been braying about how if some people have benefits that you don't have access to ( and in your scenario it would be much less possible for you to get those benefits ) then it must be unconstitutional . So either you're a hypocrite or you don't actually pay attention to what you say .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I actually have a marriage license . The same license that everyone gets from the state of Iowa , yet my license is not recognized by either the federal government or the state of Michigan , how is that not unconstitutional ? Why are those the only two options ? I want equality and I don't care how it comes about . If my rules where applied to marriage , yes it would suck , but I would then be treated equally to those heteros , who currently do not breed , can not breed , or choose not to breed , yet can get a marriage license at the drop of a hat and have it recognized . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Because the Constitution does not require them to :P It has been long established that States have authority over marriage definitions .

Are you saying it's equal for some people to get marriage benefits but single people do not ?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>What is it about the same piece of paper you do not understand ? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>The reason you have that paper is the same reason other States don't have to honor it . That reason is : States decide for themselves what constitutes a marriage . I'm still interested in the fact that you're ok with some people getting marriage benefits and others not getting them .<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Once again the state of Iowa issues one piece of paper to everyone . What part of that do you not understand ? The other states and the federal government must recognize all or none . If marriage is to be about breeders and breeding children , and my rules are adopted by the state then yes I am alright . If my rules were adopted then almost no one would get married , and those who get married have to breed if they don't they are no longer married . They have to have 3 witnesses to their act of breeding , along with a video of the event stored in the public records of the county were they live . <br><b>S1:7-  </b>I understand every part of that . Nothing makes States recognize all or none , Matthew S. In fact , it's been true since the ratification that States establish their own marriage laws ... and anyone in the State is subject to those marriage laws . It doesn't matter what other States say about your marriage because you're not in those States . No you aren't because some people would have marriage benefits but you will not . You've been very vocal that if anyone gets marriage benefits when you do not then it must be unconstitutional . Are you now saying that it's perfectly Constitutional for only some people to get marriage benefits ? And you're wrong , of course . People would get married . Besides ' having witnesses ' ( which is for the signing of the contract not the execution , duh ) , a lifelong relationship with children is the ideal marriage . It's what people hope to have .<br><b> S2:7-  </b>And why would gay people be any different ? What we have is you saying to me that I can't get married because you have some belief against it . I wish I could say to you , you can't go to that place or do that thing because I have a belief against you doing so . <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Saying heterosexuals are the same as homosexuals is political fiction . At some point you'll have to realize that biological differences exist and sometimes that has ramifications for how you're treated . It's a bit like being left-handed ; the world is sort of built around people being rightys . Sorry . You're sitting there demanding the world be changed to suit leftys as if it is your due , while at the same time casually denying that anything was made for rightys in the first place .

HOW can they claim those SPECIFIC DETRIMENTAL effects from gay marriage onto OTHER PEOPLE's marriages ???

Twice the capability to care . 2 ) Studies REFUTE the claims that dual heterosexual parents are better than dual gay parents . They aren't . Gay parents are just as good .

Neither blacks nor whites were allowed to marry outside of their race . Rights were applied equally based upon the confines of this criteria . If whom you wanted to marry fell outside of this criteria you were not allowed to wed . This is the same principal you are using to show equal rights amongst hetero and homo sexual people .

A homosexual couple cannot . Your objection is a semantic one . Admittedly , no one has the right to marriage . But again I will reiterate . That is not the issue . The issue is homosexual couples cannot get married while heterosexual couples can . In so doing the government recognizes the heterosexual couple as significant members of the same family and award that couple benefits which include the ability to visit one another in a hospital , the ability to make impotortant life decisions if one of the members should become incompasitated , the ability to cover one another under their insurance , the ability to file taxes jointly , the ability to purchase property together and survivorship rights of said property , inheritance rights , and many others . These priveleges are being denied to homosexual couples . Not people , couples . They are being denied the above privelges not because the don't deserve them but because some people don't like the idea of them having sex . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not the criteria . The effect . Except that neither the qualifying criteria nor the effect is unequal between heterosexual and homosexual individuals . True , but couples do not have rights , individuals do . Agreed . I think it's more complicated than that , but that is essentially so . Heterosexual relationships are perceived as somehow more valid or as having a purpose that homosexual relationships lack . This is true ( if " purpose " is the right word ) on an evolutionary level , so the view has some validity . Of course , that should have no automatic policy implications but it would explain some of the resistance to the idea .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Agreed . Rights may not be the correct word . But there are benefits that heterosexual couples can obtain and homosexual couples cannot . Agreed . The bolded part of your post is the basis of gay marriage proponents . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The problem is that acquiring these marriage benefits depends on how people view that type of relationship . The biological or evolutionary " purpose " might not have automatic policy implications but they are made real by the people who vote on the issue .

They do not believe that homosexuals have the right to the changes they want when it comes to marriage as they argue that the rules are global and not unequal. They argue that racial inequality between African Americans and white Americans in which they cold not marry was unequal, but that the situation cannot be compared to homosexuals because they are dissimilar.
S2 believes that S1 is wrong and that the argument for equality can apply to homosexuals as well, since heterosexual couples can marry while homosexual couples cannot.

S2 believes there is a lack of moral character in those who vote away other people's rights. They use Proposition 8 as an example of this. They compare the example of illicit public sexual acts in rest stops between homosexuals to heterosexual men who also make it public that they do the same with heterosexual women in public places.

At least that's what this article suggests : Opponents of gay marriage use many of the same arguments as foes of interracial relationships did before Loving v . Virginia outlawed state bans on interracial marriage in 1967 , said law professor Kim Forde-Mazrui at a talk sponsored by the Center for the Study of Race and Law and Lambda Law Alliance Sept . 30 . http://www.law.virginia.edu/home2002...fall/forde.htm<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This is not relevant to my argument at all . I have mentioned nothing about religious beliefs or bible-thumping protests against homosexuality . I did not bring interacial marriage into the discussion because it does not apply . I'm not against interacial marriage as long as there's a man and a woman involved . I did not bring the silly argument about water fountains into the discussion . Separate-but-equal does apply in the sense that records of legally recognized couples would separate married couples from same-sex couples but would not justify any inequalities regarding their rights and privileges . Hospital visitation , inheritance and other things could be afforded both . I'm wondering if those who insist on same-sex couples being called " married " are not acting somewhat from self-imposed shame ... like you want to hide the fact that you are gay . My argument has thusfar been limited to the requirement to redefine several other words if we redefine " marriage " . It has nothing to do with homophobia which , by the way , I do not suffer from . I have some friends that are gay and they know how I feel about the word " marriage " . We remain friends . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I accept your argument at face value , although I will say that I believe that the majority of people who argue against gay marriage do so for religious or homophobe reasons . ( Again , I'm not saying you fall into these categories . ) Words get redefined all the time , and some of them are just as important as the word ' marriage ' . For example , the Iraq War is not technically a war -- congress never declared war . And this isn't just a semantic detail , either . Declaring war used to mean that congress committed , the president committed , and all the citizens made sacrifices for the cause . Now we initiate military operations , never declare war in order to allow political wiggle room , cut everyone's taxes , tell them to go shopping , and call it a war anyway . Now that's redefining a word . Substituting a Jack for a Jill on a marriage license seems pretty minor in comparison to me .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The invasion of Iraq was a resumption of warfare that ended in a cease fire . It was not technically a new war requiring all the congressional steps . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not to derail this thread -- we can talk about this more in the Politics section -- but the last time the US Congress declared war was for WWII . So the conflict in Iraq is not in fact a resumption of a prior declared war .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're technically correct . However , the Gulf War was approved by Congress whether it was a declared war or not . The Iraq War was a continuation of the same conflict after a cease fire . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I understand the Bush administration has made this argument , but I don't think it has a whole lot of merit . It was a different presidential administration and the reasons for the conflict were different -- to repel the invasion of Kuwait . Not to mention that the same logical argument could be used to begin a fresh invasion of Vietnam or Korea .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I think not . Those conflicts ended in something other than a cease fire .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>182<br>S1 believes there is some merit in the comparison of arguments against interracial marriage and those against homosexual marriage. This person points out that many opponents of homosexual marriage use many of the same arguments those who opposed interracial marriage did. They also argue that those who oppose homosexual marriage do so for both religious and homophobic reasons. This person argues that the definition of words get frequently modified in some way and uses the example of the use of the word 'War' when referring to the Iraq War when Congress gave no official declaration of War. They argue that today a lot of military operations are automatically grouped under the word 'War'.
S2 does not believe that using examples of interracial marriage protests has relevance to the argument over allowing homosexual marriage.

I don't think they saw it the same way they would see black people . They didn't even realize that ' homosexuality ' was any sort of innate thing . It was entirely behavioral to them . I tend to agree with the court , even given what you've said . I doubt for 1909 it was about prejudice and bigotry -- they genuinely felt it was wrong . The concept of gay marriage was completely foreign and unknown in 1909 . It wasn't even something they conceived of . I think the court is saying that they couldn't have been prejudiced against something they didn't even know of or conceive of .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Hogwash . It was once entirely moral to believe certain races were inferior , and that women had fewer rights than men . Treating the races and women as equal was not something even thought of by many . It was prejudice against gays then , and it still is today . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>This is not really true . It's a popular misconstruing of morality and history by proponents of modern ' rights ' movements , but it's not true . There's little historical backing to the idea that people believed oppressing black people was a right thing to do , as in , doing good . There were times they used an argument where religion was wrongly used to justify their behavior , but that's a different matter . If you firmly believe otherwise , I'd challenge you to show where people thought oppressing blacks was an example if doing good . The same goes for misogyny . Furthermore , it's beside the point anyway . We're talking about homosexuality . In 1909 , the only thing they really understood about the issue at hand was that some people engaged in sexual relations with people of their own gender . There were no articles about " homosexuality " as a trait , and certainly none about genetic causes . It was understood entirely from a behavioral standpoint , and therefore a moral standpoint . So it's not hogwash at all -- they really did view gay sex as immoral . If you don't think so , then you have a very poor grasp on history in this case .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This kind of morality is based on nothing but ignorance ( which you admit ) and prejudice . What kind of a basis is that for a so-called moral code ? So what if it involves behaviour ? Gay people have sex , develop relationships , and bond , just like everyone else , but in a way that reflects their gay sexuality . This does not mean people could not be prejudiced about the way gay people live . People were , and are so prejudiced . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>A better reverse analogy would have been to say " So then conversly I have the right to advocate that heterosexual relations are morally wrong " . Not heterosexuality , since it's not homosexuality ( as it's a state of being ) that religious people have a problem with . Heck , they often don't even recognize it . With that caveat , yes you are certainly free to advocate whatever you want to be morally wrong . ( And unlike the way some in your movement do , I won't call you a " bigot " for doing so ! ) It may have been based on " ignorance " , but I reject the notion it was based on prejudice ( and therefore I tend to agree with the 6 - 0 view of the justices here ) . The 1909 society had too little understanding of gay people to be prejudiced over in the first place . Remember , homosexuality was not understood as a state of being at that time . The term itself had not been around long and was not known to most people . And even to those it was known to , it was not known as a state of being . And there certainly was no social identity among gay people as a group -- how could prejudice have existed if there was nothing ( from their perspective ) to be prejudiced toward ?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Right . Provided gays don't live gay , but live straight , gays can be as gay as they want . As long as gays don't outwardly show what makes them different from straights , gays can be as gay as they want . It's bs . Also some may not recognize the existence of gay people or their gay lives , but that is putting one's head in the sand . Nonsense . People would widely and hatefully use the term " sodomite " to refer to gays . Before that the term was " molly " . Clearly there was an identity they were prejudiced towards . They were rounding up gays in areas they were known to attend , and putting them in prison . Read up on the trial of Oscar Wilde . Gays may have been forced underground , to a greater extent , but that does not mean they were not thought of . Gays were just not thought of in a nice way . Gays were purposely kept out of everything in society , when society didn't really think of gays as human too . That isn't prejudice ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Because they didn't approve of sodomy ! Do you not agree they didn't understand the concept of homosexuality ??? There was no social identity . When they were put on trial , it wasn't because they were gay ( which they had no concept of ) , it was because they had gay relations which society viewed as wrong ! No , here's where you don't get it -- it's not that " gays " ( there was no concept of that ) were purposely kept out of of everything , it's that people who had sodomy relationships were kept out of everything , because sodomy was viewed as wrong .

The 10th Amendment says that those rights not specifically given to the Feds belong to the State or individuals .

But once again to the OP Obama is not given a pass on marriage equality it is just that he will never do anything to stop it and will help marriage equality become a reality .

It has happened before and can happen again . Do I need to remind you of the hundreds of thousands of native Americans that are dead at the hands of the US military or that the Japanese Americans dragged from their homes and locked away in concentration camps .

They don't think that S2's fears are warranted and such extremes cannot happen again.
S2 believes that every Republican candidate has stood on a platform that opposes gay rights, such as marriage and civil unions and wish to reinstate sodomy laws across the country. They argue that President Obama personally believes that marriage is between one man and one woman, but does not wish to push his personal beliefs into law and instead has supported marriage equality as much as he can. They argue that no president has done more for the homosexual community as President Obama. They argue that there is a legitimate danger of laws going too far and that imprisonment of homosexuals can happen as it was federally accepted in the past of different races such as the Native Americans and Japanese.<br><b> key:   </b>1-1281_466_275__483_561_576_625_633_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Give us a break , the bibe saying ' in the future there will be Wars ... and Earthquakes !

Abortions an unwed couples seems to have pretty much nothing to do with the last line . As for minorities and the constitution , the majority can change the constitution or just ignore it .

Acceptance of homosexuality effecting plate tectonics ? Time to come back to the real world , even if it is true , why should you worship a being that is quite happy to destroy homes and kill people for becoming more tolerant but is quite happy with the famine and AIDS situation and doesn't get involved with politics ? The constitution is not magic , it has been changed because enough people wanted it done , if the majority wants to ignore or change a part of the consititution it will do .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>First opff Jake started this rel ; igious topic . Reread the posts I'm only refuting his assertions . I did not say homosexuality is the cause of anything religious only citing support against Jake's comments . Don't ever try to assume you know God's mentality . Most parents love their children but they raise them according to how they feel is best . According tro what they know . Why are some parents motivator and others discipliners ? That's my popint if the majority want it they will do it . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And I refute your refutations . You implied that the Earthquakes were not a natural thing and dinviinly caused Even if there is a god , any ' loving parent ' that kills some of its children to make a point , when they are fully capable of just changing the issue anyway is hardly deserving of worship . As for people changing , not only is that dubious anyway but not really proof of anything , there are alcoholics who recover and don't drink and that is definitely genetically influenced . You clearly have no real idea about the state of genetic research or how it works , we are nowhere near finding the purpose of everything . There doesn't appear to be one gene , but there is probably a combination that lead to a greater chance of being gay . @ Rev , Power of Attorney would be fine , but giving that there is already favouritism shown to some people , why should that favouritism be arteficailly restricted .

For someoen that claims there is no God it's amazing how you're the expert now on the nature of God . i agree there is a disposition but that doesn't mean that they are genetically confined as the alcoholic isn't .

Perhaps some people are capable of thinking from another's point of view , if God is a loving parent I can't see how you can justify the view that anything lethal can be used as a punishment . I don't think you know how genetics works in this instance . Or do you think that the method of upbringing they have is purely responisble ? I don't really see any real problem with polygamy itself , but it would have to be watched a little more carefully perhaps as the cultures that practise polygamy tend to be less focused on equality between sexs . As long as you make sure that the marriages are still volentary for both partners and that any person is fully able to leave if they want to then I can't really see the problem . However it is a lot more complicated if you are looking from the benefits point of view with respect to inheritance and other aspects ( child support and suchlike ) but these are realitively minor points that would just have to be worked out if this type of marriage was to be recognised<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>178<br>S1 argues that the bible warning of wars and natural disasters is not viable proof nor an argument since wars and natural disasters will always happen.

They state that they haven't been argued that religious beliefs condone homosexuality, but that religious beliefs shouldn't have anything to do with another person's individual life. They refute the idea that earthquakes are a divinely inspired event. They also believe that genetics has more to do with homosexuality and alcoholism than choice or upbringing.
S2 believes that since the number of earthquakes have increased outside of Israel over the past one hundred years, that it is a sign of God's love waxing cold.

I didn't bring up religon in my argument . Jake did . So please don't specualte anything until you knwo what we're talking about . All laws are based upon morals . So it is based upon the morals of the country whcih happen to be predominantly Christian . England was one of many countries . There is no new family structure that didn't exist before this country . My definition of negative effect is that the puposes for which something is created is hindered or compromises . By changing standards there is a harm to it's integrity . Intregrity is compromised when it isn't stable . Soemthing that changes all teh time loses that integrity like John Kerry on his views . Things must remain consistent to be integral . This argument has a flaw . That when there is guaranteed religous freedomw then we dont ' have equal rights . Everyone has equal rights in terms of believing . However behavior is regualted by the government . Therefore we can do anyting in the name of religion until it violates behavior that is acceptable by society .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Fine , so what if the government said people are free to ' believe ' in God , but any sign of them putting their belief into practice , such as going to church or even just praying in private was illegal ? Would that be acceptable ? After all it is just regulating behaviourA , not belief ? Your comparisons are ludicrous . All of these situations involve non-consensual acts either through lack of knowledge or involvement of minors . You cannot compare that to consensual acts between adults . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That probably wouldn't be acceptable to most people but it would be legal and equal . They don't allow religious practices of polygamy , animal or human sacrifices , body mutilation , and many other religious practices . So then we should allow prostitution , polygamy , human trafficking , drug trafficking , gambling , drug distribution , and all other consensual acts .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But they obviously wouldn't be equal , because a significant proportion of the population would be restricted from worshipping how they want in a for that hurts nobody . These elements mostly have links to crime over and above the act itself , that justifies restrictions . Homosexuality doesn't . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The poeple would be equal . The religions would not . Look at our country . Almost all Christian beleifs are legal and no other non-Christians Churches have almost all their legal beleifs . That's it ? Crime ? That's it . The criminal link ? So if they criminalized homosexuality then it would be okay to ban gay marriage . Homosexuality has links to crime too . Sodomy is a crime . Define harm becaue homosexuality is harmful according to many .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>This is not equality . You are using the letter of the law to twist the purpose of the law , and even then doing it using very shaky logic . Equality is about general concepts , not specifics . It is equality to say ' everyone is has the same right to worship who they want ' , it is not equality to say ' everyone has the same right to worship who we tell them to ' . That is equality within an unequal system , which cannot be counted . Can you re-phrase , I don't follow . No . As I said , those have strong links to criminal activity irrespective of the act itself being a crime . For example drug use has noted links to theft , the same just cannot be said for homosexuality . No it isn't . And even if it was , that has nothing to do with homosexuality anyway . Physical or psychological injury or damage . Homosexuality is therefore in no way harmful . And I have serous doubts about the ' many ' who say it is . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Equality is treating every person the same . However it does not mean treating every person's behavior the same . It does not mean treat every organization the same either . Everyone has the same rights . NOt every religous practice , ideology , or behavior get the same treatment . Teh people determine what is in the public's interest to protect and ban . It basically only the Christian practices that are completely legal . Islamic polgamy and other religons don't have their practices recognized as often as christianity . Homosexuality has strong links to sodomy . Also prostitution is legal in Nevada so shoudl all states be forced to allow taht behavior ? Insome states adults cann have sex wiht 14 - 16 yr olds in some cases . Should other states recognize that too ? Most serial killers of men and young boys were homosexuals . Sodomy is a crime do you wnat me to post it ? gynocologist , Gi specialists , and colon specialist have all stated the effects homosexual related activites . Also there is a higher risk of disease transmission among homosexual men so much so they are not allowed to donate blood for 5 yrs from their last activity .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>179<br>S1 believes that all laws are based on morals and that because the country of the United States is predominantly Christian, their laws will reflect those beliefs.

S2 argues that if the government allowed for people to believe in God, but made it illegal to put their beliefs into practice, such as going to church or private prayer at home, that it would be similar to the situation with homosexuals being unable to marry, and thus inequality.

I will make one point here . Heterosexual marriage is one of the most universal of all human institutions , found in almost all cultures ever existing . With a precedent like that , the question isn't , " Why Mr. Galton are you opposed to gay marriage ? " The question is how do you justify revolutionizing that ancient institution ? To me , heterosexual marriage is the Parthenon : ancient , beautiful , crumbling some of late , but it would be a tragedy to knock it down , clear it out , and put in a new building . You prove to me why that new building is so gotdamn necessary .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It is circular to say marriage has simply always been heterosexual , end of debate . No one is talking about knocking down marriage . Gay families want to enter into it , because they want their families strengthened and protected as heterosexual families have been strenghtened and protected . Gay families want into the institution because they want to be a positive influence on it , to support it and to shore it up , not because they desire to harm it . They are fighting to get into it , as some heterosexuals can't wait to get out of it . I can't see if it would make such a dramatic change just because the couple are the same sex . Also marriage in the U.S. and Canada falls under common-law . This is a " living law " meant to evolve with society , with much room for interpretation by judges . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You're gonna have to explain your circularity argument for us slow folks . And you're gonna have to back up your statement that gays as a group are really in their hearts conservatives , with a love of traditional institutions like marriage . I strongly suspect that you have some homosexuals who want the right to marriage for romantic reasons , some who want it for economic / legal privilege reasons , but also very many who want it so as to affirm that homosexuality is just as good as heterosexuality . It's the idea of we're just as good as you are , so we must be able to have everything you can have . For many , I suspect it is not a desire to adopt a more conservative lifestyle , but to make a point , and move the culture toward greater acceptance . This is a risky gamble to shove this down peoples ' throats as it may cause a backlash instead of greater legitimization of the lifestyle . Oh and you've got to be kidding me that gay marriage doesn't revolutionize marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Takes us back to where we started , assumes it absolutely must be and cannot be different or change . Sure , there are many who want acceptance from society , parents , friends , and that is a big reason why they marry , for gays or straights . If gays want their marriages to compete with heterosexual marriages , to prove gay marriages can be more successful , wouldn't that be good for the institution ? The old fashioned backlash argument is not a reason to not do something , and frankly is a little tired and worn-out in 2004 . Gays are just as good as you are . Is there a problem with gays believing and acting like they are just as good ? We don't have the strong sense of different gender roles we once had , so why is it such a revolutionary change ? I can't see that it has revolutionized the societies where it is in effect . It could have represented the next step in a very gradual continuation of acceptance that had been going on for a long time . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I am not arguing that heterosexual marriage must be as it has been or cannot be different . I am arguing that that revolutionizing such an important , ancient institution requires some heavy justification . People who have no respect for the past may not find my point compelling ; people who look to the past with deep respect and see in it old wisdom will find it compelling . I for one do not want to revolutionize an ancient institution I have great respect for , in order so the gay community can prove something . Tired argument ?! My god , how long have we been debating gay marriage ? Only four or five years ago in grad school , we were discussing how difficult it would be to see more and more rights to be extended to cohabiting gays couples , and we talked a little bit about gay civil unions . Marriage wasn't even on the damn table ! Homosexuality is an eccentricity ; in my mind it is not equal in value to heterosexuality . This is not an issue of how gays believe and act ; it is an issue of whether we are going to enshrine homosexual marriage as we do with heterosexual marriage . Gender , sexuality , and family organization are absolutely fundamental aspects of society -- always have been , always will be .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes , the hetero-only definition of marriage has been around a long time . However , simply because something is traditional does not make it just . Well that's how you see it because of your contempt for the gay community . You see it as " them " trying to step out of their lower place , or prove they are not lower than you and equal in value . Your last comment I've dealt with in this post , demonstrates that very well . Yes , the backlash threat is tired and boring . No one is listening anymore . Well , I remember people talking about marriage for gays and lesbians and their rights for much longer . Well , that says it all about where you are coming from . You believe homosexuals are human beings of lesser value . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I believe homosexual behavior is an eccentricity and not equal in value to heterosexuality . I was not referring to the value of persons ; I think homosexuals have as much intrinsic value as anyone else . I have contempt for no one . Your attempt to paint people who disagree with you as haters is unfair and a cheap debate tactic .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Homosexuals are persons who have homosexual behaviour . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>We are all sophisticated enough to separate behavior from person . I don't have to tell you that homosexuals are MUCH more than whom they prefer to sleep with .<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Yes , there is also homosexual orientation , which is part of the person's homosexual identity , and part of the person's homosexuality . The orientation leads to the behaviour .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>178<br>S1 argues that heterosexual marriage is one of the most universal of all human institutions, found in almost all cultures that have ever existed. They believe that the true question is proposing a justification in revolutionizing that ancient institution.

They warn that there is a risk of backlash with this way of thinking. They believe that homosexuality is an eccentricity and is not equal in value to heterosexuality.
S2 does not believe that homosexuals are attempting to destroy the idea of marriage but only wish to be included into it. They believe that homosexuals should be as accepted socially as heterosexuals and find it difficult to see a problem with homosexuals believing and acting as equals to heterosexuals.

You accuse the court of illegitimate " judicial activism " for upholding such protections . Obviosly so far as you are concerned , if equal protections are upheld for gay Americans , it's illegitimate . Obviously not in the states that prohibit it . Can't you read the laws ? Indeed , the state and federal laws on the issue are specifically directed against gay people . It is woefully disingenuous of you to pretend otherwise . Another case of malicious disingenuity . Not even you can take it seriously with a straight face that these laws don't exist because gay people insist on equal rights , and homophobes want to deny them . If you don't know what equality means , by all means invest in a dictionary . Then you haven't much understanding of it . It applies to this case , and there are a large number of court decisions that agree with this understanding , this being just the latest . The straw men are all in your posts .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why can't you answer my question ? I simply said that it is illegitimate to say the constitution means one thing when it never has . I certainly can and there is nothing saying they can't within the restrictions by the law . Perhaps you don't . Let's look at marriage as an example . Marriage restrictions based on age , sex , species , number of , capacity , and perhaps a few other things . If you want " equal protection " the way you define it then all of these restrictions ( short of capacity ) would have to be removed . Is this what you mean by equal protection ? There seems to be more that disagree with you but that is beside the point . The only way you get to equal protection meaning what you want it to mean is if you evolve the constitution to a new meaning . If you can prove to me how gay marriage was part of the original meaning of the term " equal protection " then I'd be very much impressed . nice response Can you show me where I made a strawman ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Oh dear . I suppose I am extremely stupid in thinking that when a constitution says equal protections under the law , it means equal protections under the law . Evidently , it means : " Except gays " .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Can you show a document that suggests the original meaning of " equal protection " means equality for gays but not for other groups ? If you like I can explain the original understanding of the 14th amendment and how it wouldn't apply to gays unless they were denied marriage as defined today for being gay . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Can you show us a document that shows equality applies to groups other than gays ? Where does the Constitution say , " Except gays " ? Do you seriously imagine gay people want to marry the opposite sex ? Do you seriously think it is not an obstacle to their pursuit of life , liberty and happiness to prevent them from marrying the partners they love ? After all , you folk take your right to marry the consenting adults you love for granted , but for some pig-headed reason , you think it's OK to deny gay Americans the same rights you have . And you think that's constitutional ? Steve , that's bigotry .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are borderline breaking the rules of the forum . That aside , did you want me to explain the meaning of equal protection or not ? If it makes you feel better I wouldn't think it was denial of equal protection if marriage was denied as two men or two women marrying each other . No , they can't marry each other . Not sure how that is protection but if it is then consider gays protected too . I'm not saying you should think the way I do but at least I am trying to answer your questions and respond to your points . All you seem to be doing is ignoring my posts and insulting me . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>yawn . But since that is the denial of equal rights , obviously you would be wrong to think that . Nope . A very disingenuous argument . Gay partnerships are NOT protected the same way as straight ones -- in many places , they are illegal . That would be obvious even to a blind man , but not to someone deliberately denying the facts . I am pointing out that your opinions are wrong . As to why you make the erroneous arguments you do , i can only surmise .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No because in that case everyone is still allowed to marry under what marriage means . so is a daughter and father relationship which was the topic at hand ... Why are they wrong ? Why can't you explain why denial of some things that aren't equal is ok and doesn't violate equal protection but with gay marriage it does ? It is this question that makes or breaks your entire argument .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>178<br>S1 argues that state and federal laws on the issue of homosexual marriage are specifically directed against homosexuals. They believe that the courts are upholding equal protections and that those who oppose the rulings do so because of prejudice.

S2 believes that it is illegitimate to argue that the constitution means one thing when it was never meant to in the first place.

In a modern secular society there is no reason not to extend marriage to other forms of relationships . However just extending marriage to gay couples is not enough , it must be extended to all permutations of sexual relationships and society must look at sexual relationships that are otherwise banned . I cannot see why marriage should be granted to you but an incestuous relationship be illegal . Making homosexual sex legal is a far cry to making gay relationships officially equal to hetero ones . You are no ' better ' than two half brothers having a sexual relationship or a mother and son ..o r indeed a polygamous gay relationship ... it all deviates from the present definition of marriage . If you get it , everyone should get it .<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Would you agree that each form of proposed marriage arrangements would need to be argued on their own merits separately ? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Yes bit it should be considered in one package . I dont see why gays should have their relationships officialised ( is that a word ? ) and pull up the ladder so other types of relationships cannot follow . Before gay marriage is allowed then all types of sexual relationships should be considered . Lets face it , it would be far harder for people to accept a complete revolution in what we consider to be an appropriate relationship to become an official family than to just allow gays to do it ... using the very arguments that gays have to justify them officially marrying we can justify most other type of marriage . So to prohibit other forms of marriage would be tantamount to discrimination<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>180<br>S1 believes that homosexual marriages should not be prohibited, but also believes that heterosexual marriages and homosexual marriages are not the same. They believe that if homosexuals are allowed to marry, than any kind of marriage between consenting adults should be allowed, otherwise you are discriminating against the person wanting to enter into the marriage. They believe that S2 deserves as much protection as an incestuous or polygamous relationship that has children. Overall, they believe that if homosexual marriages are allowed then it should branch out to other types of potential marriages.
S2 points out that with full civil marriage equality, benefits otherwise not available to homosexual couples are now options such as survivor's benefits of social security or retained guardianship of their children. They don't see a reason for homosexual couples to have to go through a different process than heterosexuals in order to gain the same benefits of heterosexual marriage. Since S2 has children, they do not believe that they are any less deserving of government benefits of marriage than heterosexual couples with children.<br><b> key:   </b>1-3089_96_94__97_99_103_105_108_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>As I already stated Kerry expected to carry Ohio and got smashed there ........

First , to assume that the majority of people in Ohio were either silent about their views on same-sex marriage or on their choice for president is utter nonsense . They were absolutely as loud-mouthed about it as anyone else . Your implications that there is some " silent majority " imply a misunderstanding of the political battlefield , and I hope I have been able to clear it up . Next , although Bush won by a larger margin than Bill Clinton ( who you term " slick Willie " for no other reason than to anger and insult his supporters , I assume ? ) , this does not mean that Clinton did not win by a larger percentage . Remember that population increases over time , and there was a slightly higher voter turnout in this election due to its controversy . Even though Bush by a large number of voters compared to previous elections , he won by a marginal percentage due to the fact that the population of the US has increased . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Actually the population growth has nothing to do with the margin of victory ... I am talking about the votes President Bush won by and " Slick Willie " did not even get a 50 percent majority in either the 1992 and the 1996 election ......... He was very lucky that Perot ran in 1992 otherwise Bush would have defeated him ....... I am sure you have heard the term silent majority before ......... These are the people that when they vote make all the polls that the left wing media put out like the presidents approval rating is down or how bad the economy is or how bad the war in Iraq is going ..........

That gives Bush a negative . 5% in popular vote . In 2004 , Bush had 51% of the popular vote while Kerry had 48.1% . That gives Bush a victory by 2.9% of the popular vote . In comparison , Clinton in 1992 had 43% of the vote while Bush Sr. had 37.4% of the vote , which gives Clinton a win by 5.6% . In 1996 , Dole had 40.7% of the vote while Clinton had 49.2% of the vote , which gives Clinton the win by 8.5% .

The majority in Ohio ( and all of those other 11 states ) was in fact very , very vocal . Every poll was accurate . The term " silent majority " is not appropriate . I have no doubt that majority's desire to oppress the minority did play some factor in Bush's win in Ohio , but statistics suggest that it was a very small part . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Just for your information getting a majority of the vote means over 50 percent ........

All the protesting in the world wouldn't have brought it about if the will of the people were not changing to make it happen . At the end of the day , any legislative movement needs the will of the people to be successful . It may not need a full majority in some cases , but it needs enough people on board . That's why legislation requires not only voting ( by legislature ) , but elected officials to do so as well . There was a process our country went through on those issues as whether or not they were legitimate in terms of the law -- it involved a national debate , protests , etc. Sometimes this process results in our country ( the people ) granting civil rights legislation , and sometimes it doesn't ( depending on whether it is deemed warranted ) . The process ( which will undoubtedly take years ) is going on right now in regards to gays . Time will tell what the result will be . Any form of legislation is a voting matter .

If you have a beef with the people being able to work toward determining our society's standards ( through voting on such issues ) , then if I were you I'd take it up with the govt .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Or we could take it up here , like Matthew did , and discuss it . Or at least try to , and hope someone doesn't derail the conversation into irrelevant issues like how the legislature works . I will echo the point that several have made here . The idea of allowing the masses to determine civil rights is stupid and wrong . If a group's civil rights need protecting , then they need protecting from the very masses that are doing the voting . Ballot measures may be a legal process , but that doesn't prevent them from being stupid and wrong , now does it ? That's the point that's trying to be made here . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well , that's up to you . If you don't want to derail it , you don't have to . It seems to me that what is really happening in society with these ballot initiatives and other parts of the process is determining whether or not it is a civil right in the first place to give legal marriage to whatever group arrangement is in question . ( In this case , gays couples . ) That process has to take place ; it is just not feasible in our society to give marriage equality to any group of any arrangement that comes along demanding it until we determine for certain that it needs to be done . If society determines that same-sex arrangements of two people should suffice to redefine marriage for it to be included , then so be it . But that process has to be there in some form , realistically . If you are going to draw the line in terms of what can be voted on a ballot initiative or not , what authority determines that ? How are you going to determine where that line is drawn ? And you can't just arbitrarily say " when civil rights are being infringed " because that doesn't carry any legal weight -- it's opinion . Just saying it's " stupid " and " wrong " may be your point being made , but it's a point that doesn't offer any solutions .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You really are a piece of work . All you're saying here is that if society wants to be bigoted it should be allowed to be .

You will of course claim that the government can't do anything , but history has proven that position wrong . The government has taken stands against biggotry before , and while it hasn't eradicated it , it has improved things .

Homosexuals are not a part of the traditional or cultural meaning of marriage . In order to be included , the meaning of marriage would have to change . The catch-22 is that homosexual couples want to be included in the current meaning of marriage , but what gives marriage meaning specifically excludes homosexual couples .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That's your definition . It is certainly not my definition . You don't speak for all of society . I personally define marriage as a union of two people who love one another and wish to make a commitment to one another . If marriage is about reproduction , why does nobody bat an eye when a 65 year old woman marries a 68 year old man ? If you believe marriage is " formalization of a mating pair " , and " reproduction is implied " , doesn't this cheapen the institution of marriage in your eyes ? Obviously , they are not getting married to start a family ... perhaps love is what is important ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Mating pairs exist with or without marriage , and have no legal connection with marriage ( since , legally , it doesn't matter if the two people even like one another , or ever intend on consumating said marriage ) . The only connection between a mating couple and marriage is the connection made on a cultural level . So , logically , the cultural meaning of marriage would be the purpose of a mating couple . While ' purpose ' can mean different things , in this context I daresay most would refer to the evolutionary purpose of a mating couple : reproduction . Love is implied because love brings the couple together for that purpose . While legally a 27 yr old marrying a 70 yr old sugar daddy is not a problem , culturally speaking this marriage is not as meaningful as one that is in-line with the evolutionary purpose I outlined above . You can point to exceptions all you want , but all it does is outline the difference between the legal meaning and the cultural meaning of marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Who gave you the power to decide what is culturally meaningful ?

I've heard Colson speak , BTW ; he speaks all over the country . I agree with some of what he's said and some I don't . He would say the same thing about kids raised in single parent homes ; but it's not that he's saying single parent homes are bad ; he's saying that homes with a mother and father are the best scenario . I think that's what he's saying here too . He's basically saying that by his observations of prisons , that traditional families do best in terms of raising children and them staying out of prison . Whether he's right or not is another matter , but I think it's important to at least represent the man's statements correctly here .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>He's done pretty well for a felon .

I wonder how long it will be before folks like Colson and you stop drawing conclusions about same-sex couples from your observations of single-parenthood . Never , I suppose . sigh <br><b>S1:2-  </b>How do you know he wouldn't support one if it were up for a vote ? I wonder how long it will be before folks like you stop claiming things that aren't happening ? I don't draw such conclusions . Sorry . . . accidentally misworded that . No " game " intended at all .

The game I'm talking about has nothing to do with that omission . The game , as you well know , is to engage in disagreement on every possible point . It's right there in your job description . Page 3 , paragraph 2 and 5 . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Look , there's really no need to be hostile here . With all due respect , I do agree on the record here sometimes with people who support gay rights . For instance , I've said I agree the amendment is a bad thing . I've said on numerous occassions that I agree that gays experience violence and harassment and measures must be taken to change that . I've agreed with the gay rights stance on gay adoption . I've agreed that gays shouldn't have to face job and housing discrimination . I've agreed on numerous things . Those aren't instances of disagreement , but of agreement . Maybe I just haven't often found your comments agreeable .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes , I know . You may remember that I pointed out your opposition to the amendment to another poster just the other day . It's precisely the discrepancy between your stated beliefs and your constant arguments in opposition to them that lead people to believe that you do not , in fact , support gay rights . There are other possibilities , of course . Personally , I've latched onto the idea that you're paid to be here . I realize it's a bit silly , but , frankly , it's the least morally repugnant one I can come up with , and I hate to think ill of people I don't know . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>What evv .

Can you describe the hand gestures that went with that ?<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>180<br>S1 believes that what is happening is a redefining of the meanings behind family and marriage. Specifically, they believe that the definitions for both are being broadened. This person argues that to certain people, that is what matters and is why people oppose homosexual marriage. They point out that those who speak out against it believe that traditional families perform the best in terms of raising children and keeping them from becoming criminals. He or she argues that these people do not believe that single parent homes are bad, necessarily, but that a home with both a mother and a father are best. However, he or she personally agrees with the homosexual movement's opinions on the matter of homosexual marriage and that there should be efforts to stop discrimination and harassment.
S2 believes that people with opinions opposing homosexual marriage are getting their opinions from negative observations of single parenthood. They do not believe that S1 has been consistent in their arguments and that S1's opinions lean towards standing against homosexual rights rather than supporting them.<br><b> key:   </b>1-5672_6_5__7_13_15_16_17_20_2 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Actually , I think it's probably the most compelling argument I've read for the amendment . The be fair , I don't think the author is claiming there is a direct link between gay marriage and crime . He seems to be talking about overall effect on society and traditional family . But I'm still against the amendment ; amending the constitution over something like this is just not the right thing to do .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>" compelling argument " ? So do you believe the basis of what he's claiming ? And are you ready to debate it ? Because there is no " overall effect on society and traditional family " from gay marriage . The " traditional family " has been having its OWN problems , and has been in decline in these countries LONG BEFORE gay marriage ever was legalized . It's like a guy jumping out of an airplane , and he starts falling to the ground . Three seconds later gay marriage is legalized , and conservatives want to blame the fact that he's falling on gay marriage ... It makes no sense . There is no causality here ... Do straight people say , " Hey ! Gay marriage is legal . I don't want to get married now . " Do straight people say , " Hey ! Gay marriage is legal . I want to get a divorce now . " The " most compelling argument " lacks any semblance of sense . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes it does , because what is happening here is that ' family ' and ' marriage ' are being redefined . It is being broadened . People like Colson believe that marriage and family fits a certain criteria for it to truly be a marriage .

I don't see how you can say that it DOES have an effect on that . Tell me , for starters , WHAT effect it will happen . Will Colson get a divorce if gay marriage is legalized ? Will Colson wish he had never gotten married if gay marriage is legalized ? THEY are claiming SPECIFIC effects . NEGATIVE effects . Effects that should be PROVEN for them to be claimed ... HOW can they claim those SPECIFIC DETRIMENTAL effects from gay marriage onto OTHER PEOPLE's marriages ??? Where's the proof ? 1 ) Studies DO back-up the issue of " single vs dual parent house-holds " . And that is common sense . Two heads are better than one . Twice the capability to care . 2 ) Studies REFUTE the claims that dual heterosexual parents are better than dual gay parents . They aren't . Gay parents are just as good . The gender of the parents are irrelevant . The sexual orientation of the parents is irrelevant . Where did I misrepresent something Jyoshu ? He's claiming a SPECIFIC DETRIMENTAL EFFECT on families due to gay marriage . THAT is what I'm talking about . THAT is what I want proven , if he's going to claim it . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Easy . . . marriage in the defined sense will be changed . It will be more broadened . Where did he claim that ? All I see is that he feels that traditional families are better in terms of kids from them staying out of prison . It seemed to me you were representing this as someone ' blaming ' gay marriage for crime . If that's not what you meant , then fair enough .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Is that ALL the effect you are claiming then ? Are you then contradicting the previous article's claim that it will have a negative effect on heterosexual marriages ? Did you read the article Jyoshu ? Do you even know what we're talking about ? Again , did you READ the article Jyoshu ? Because if not , then why did you claim : " Actually , I think it's probably the most compelling argument I've read for the amendment .

It's there in black and white ! <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I never said I was compelled , or convinced by the article . I said it was probably the most compelling that I've seen . I see nothing in that quote blaming gay marriage for crime , directy OR even indirectly . You are making an inference --o ne that may or may NOT be intended . I would think if Colson's point was to lay blame for crime he would have simply said so . He didn't . Colson is simply opposing thge amendment because he believes that traditional families are best in terms of avoiding crime . I don't really agree either -- I think there are too many variables for that to automatically be the case .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Oh . I see . So if somebody said " Christianity causes cancer " , that would be a compelling argument for people to not be Christians . Right ? Give me a freakin ' break Jyoshu . READ the article . It's talking about gay marriage and the effects of it on society . It makes claims that : 1 ) Gay marriage will cause detriment to straight marriages . 2 ) Detriment to straight marriages , e.g. single parent families , yield greater instances of criminals . It's all right there . In plain English . I am making no " inference " . This IS what the author is saying . Then explain to me his next paragraph where he links LEGALIZATION of gay marriage to a decrease in " traditional families " . Can't you put two and two together ? And Colson is not " opposing " the amendment . He's SUPPORTING it . From the article : " This is just one reason that I am so passionately in favor of the Marriage Protection Amendment ... " Can't you even get THAT right ? Or are you so lost in obfuscation that you've confused yourself ?<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>178<br>S1 doesn't agree that amending the Constitution is the right things to do, though they find the argument connecting society and traditional family compelling regardless. They believe that the definition of the words family and marriage are being broadened and redefined. They argue that those who oppose this change believe that marriage and family fit a certain criteria to truly be a marriage, and that criteria is traditional marriage. They agree on some points with these people, and believe that adopting homosexual marriage will have an effect on that definition, but they don't on others.
S2 doesn't believe that there will be an effect on traditional marriage because of the adoption of homosexual marriages. They believe that the traditional family has its own problems and has been in decline long before the issue was brought up. They don't agree that connecting society and traditional family to homosexual marriage is logical or compelling and that there is reasonable evidence for the contrary.

They believe there is no distinction between homosexuality and sexual relations, and that one cannot be homosexual without practicing intercourse with one's own gender. They believe that when people discuss homosexual marriage that they are trying to disguise what they believe to be deviant sexual activity by using the word marriage.
S2 argues against S1 by stating that heterosexual marriages can be portrayed without sexual relations being alluded to or mentioned.

At least that's what this article suggests : Opponents of gay marriage use many of the same arguments as foes of interracial relationships did before Loving v . Virginia outlawed state bans on interracial marriage in 1967 , said law professor Kim Forde-Mazrui at a talk sponsored by the Center for the Study of Race and Law and Lambda Law Alliance Sept . 30 . http://www.law.virginia.edu/home2002...fall/forde.htm<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This is not relevant to my argument at all . I have mentioned nothing about religious beliefs or bible-thumping protests against homosexuality . I did not bring interacial marriage into the discussion because it does not apply . I'm not against interacial marriage as long as there's a man and a woman involved . I did not bring the silly argument about water fountains into the discussion . Separate-but-equal does apply in the sense that records of legally recognized couples would separate married couples from same-sex couples but would not justify any inequalities regarding their rights and privileges . Hospital visitation , inheritance and other things could be afforded both . I'm wondering if those who insist on same-sex couples being called " married " are not acting somewhat from self-imposed shame ... like you want to hide the fact that you are gay . My argument has thusfar been limited to the requirement to redefine several other words if we redefine " marriage " . It has nothing to do with homophobia which , by the way , I do not suffer from . I have some friends that are gay and they know how I feel about the word " marriage " . We remain friends . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I accept your argument at face value , although I will say that I believe that the majority of people who argue against gay marriage do so for religious or homophobe reasons . ( Again , I'm not saying you fall into these categories . ) Words get redefined all the time , and some of them are just as important as the word ' marriage ' . For example , the Iraq War is not technically a war -- congress never declared war . And this isn't just a semantic detail , either . Declaring war used to mean that congress committed , the president committed , and all the citizens made sacrifices for the cause . Now we initiate military operations , never declare war in order to allow political wiggle room , cut everyone's taxes , tell them to go shopping , and call it a war anyway . Now that's redefining a word . Substituting a Jack for a Jill on a marriage license seems pretty minor in comparison to me .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The invasion of Iraq was a resumption of warfare that ended in a cease fire . It was not technically a new war requiring all the congressional steps . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not to derail this thread -- we can talk about this more in the Politics section -- but the last time the US Congress declared war was for WWII . So the conflict in Iraq is not in fact a resumption of a prior declared war .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're technically correct . However , the Gulf War was approved by Congress whether it was a declared war or not . The Iraq War was a continuation of the same conflict after a cease fire . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I understand the Bush administration has made this argument , but I don't think it has a whole lot of merit . It was a different presidential administration and the reasons for the conflict were different -- to repel the invasion of Kuwait . Not to mention that the same logical argument could be used to begin a fresh invasion of Vietnam or Korea .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I think not . Those conflicts ended in something other than a cease fire .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>194<br>S1 seems to agree with the comparison between interracial marriage and same sex marriage, citing that many of the arguments against them are similar.  He believes that words can be redefined including the word marriage and uses war as an example.  He brings up the fact that war has not been declared since WWII but the country has been involved in war-like situations and typically these are referred to as war.  He sees this as being off topic but this debate ends up dominating the remaining part of the text.
S2 does not agree that marriage should be redefined to include same sex couples.  He does not believe himself to be a homophobe and cites friendships with gay individuals to back up his claim.  His issue is not with rights or the actual relationships themselves, he believes in full rights for gay couples, but he does not believe that the relationships should be able to bear the label marriage because it is not between a man and woman.  When the topic changes to the use of the term war he does not disagree with S1 but gives information challenging previous statements.<br><b> key:   </b>1-5811_33_29__35_38_40_41_43_2 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Don't you think that in 1909 it was probably viewed mostly from a moral standpoint ? I don't think they saw it the same way they would see black people . They didn't even realize that ' homosexuality ' was any sort of innate thing . It was entirely behavioral to them . I tend to agree with the court , even given what you've said . I doubt for 1909 it was about prejudice and bigotry -- they genuinely felt it was wrong . The concept of gay marriage was completely foreign and unknown in 1909 . It wasn't even something they conceived of . I think the court is saying that they couldn't have been prejudiced against something they didn't even know of or conceive of .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Hogwash . It was once entirely moral to believe certain races were inferior , and that women had fewer rights than men . Treating the races and women as equal was not something even thought of by many . It was prejudice against gays then , and it still is today . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>This is not really true . It's a popular misconstruing of morality and history by proponents of modern ' rights ' movements , but it's not true . There's little historical backing to the idea that people believed oppressing black people was a right thing to do , as in , doing good . There were times they used an argument where religion was wrongly used to justify their behavior , but that's a different matter . If you firmly believe otherwise , I'd challenge you to show where people thought oppressing blacks was an example if doing good . The same goes for misogyny . Furthermore , it's beside the point anyway . We're talking about homosexuality . In 1909 , the only thing they really understood about the issue at hand was that some people engaged in sexual relations with people of their own gender . There were no articles about " homosexuality " as a trait , and certainly none about genetic causes . It was understood entirely from a behavioral standpoint , and therefore a moral standpoint . So it's not hogwash at all -- they really did view gay sex as immoral . If you don't think so , then you have a very poor grasp on history in this case .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This kind of morality is based on nothing but ignorance ( which you admit ) and prejudice . What kind of a basis is that for a so-called moral code ? So what if it involves behaviour ? Gay people have sex , develop relationships , and bond , just like everyone else , but in a way that reflects their gay sexuality . This does not mean people could not be prejudiced about the way gay people live . People were , and are so prejudiced . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>A better reverse analogy would have been to say " So then conversly I have the right to advocate that heterosexual relations are morally wrong " . Not heterosexuality , since it's not homosexuality ( as it's a state of being ) that religious people have a problem with . Heck , they often don't even recognize it . With that caveat , yes you are certainly free to advocate whatever you want to be morally wrong . ( And unlike the way some in your movement do , I won't call you a " bigot " for doing so ! ) It may have been based on " ignorance " , but I reject the notion it was based on prejudice ( and therefore I tend to agree with the 6 - 0 view of the justices here ) . The 1909 society had too little understanding of gay people to be prejudiced over in the first place . Remember , homosexuality was not understood as a state of being at that time . The term itself had not been around long and was not known to most people . And even to those it was known to , it was not known as a state of being . And there certainly was no social identity among gay people as a group -- how could prejudice have existed if there was nothing ( from their perspective ) to be prejudiced toward ?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Right . Provided gays don't live gay , but live straight , gays can be as gay as they want . As long as gays don't outwardly show what makes them different from straights , gays can be as gay as they want . It's bs . Also some may not recognize the existence of gay people or their gay lives , but that is putting one's head in the sand . Nonsense . People would widely and hatefully use the term " sodomite " to refer to gays . Before that the term was " molly " . Clearly there was an identity they were prejudiced towards . They were rounding up gays in areas they were known to attend , and putting them in prison . Read up on the trial of Oscar Wilde . Gays may have been forced underground , to a greater extent , but that does not mean they were not thought of . Gays were just not thought of in a nice way . Gays were purposely kept out of everything in society , when society didn't really think of gays as human too . That isn't prejudice ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Because they didn't approve of sodomy ! Do you not agree they didn't understand the concept of homosexuality ??? There was no social identity . When they were put on trial , it wasn't because they were gay ( which they had no concept of ) , it was because they had gay relations which society viewed as wrong ! No , here's where you don't get it -- it's not that " gays " ( there was no concept of that ) were purposely kept out of of everything , it's that people who had sodomy relationships were kept out of everything , because sodomy was viewed as wrong . They really did think it was wrong ! You are so determined to portray everything that has anything to do with gay relations possibly being wrong as prejudice and bigotry that you are close-minded about it .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>189<br>S1 divides the sexuality from the social identity of homosexuals throughout his arguments.  He defends those who in 1909 were against homosexuality.  He saw this as an issue not of bigotry but of ignorance.  He argues that other moral decisions that have been overturned such as racist and sexist decisions were not based on an argument that they were "good" decisions.  In dealing with sexuality, the term homosexual was relatively new and people did not even have the idea of two men in a relationship in their conceptual realm. There was persecution of gay men but he argues they were not persecuting against the people but rather the act of sodomy.
S2 does not believe there was an intentional separation of act and person in the early persecution of gay men.  He compares viewing homosexuality as immoral to previous racist and sexist beliefs that were considered the norm.  He questions how people can create a moral code based off ignorance.  He also argues against the separation of the act and person by citing the trial of Oscar Wilde and use of derogatory terms against homosexuals.<br><br><b>worker_id </b>A13I60JU7P5URT<br>HITid:</b>  3WJGKMRWVI9P7IRH7R0DOTWFSACDC1<br> <b>Status:</b>Approved<br><b> key:   </b>1-2844_72_71__73_74_75_81_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>The Republicans are pushing the " hot-button " issues by appealing to people's ignorance and prejudice , in order to distract them from the important bread and butter issues that directly affect EVERYONE on a daily basis .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Oh , I don't know .

Now , THERE'S some revisionist history . It was a Republican Congress that first balanced the budget after gaining control of the HR for the first time in 40 years . Unfortunately , the legacy costs imposed by the Democratic social engineering make it so the budget will probably never be balanced again . Ah , right out of the liberal handbook .

Will they do this for other groups who want equal rights ? It's certainly up for debate which side is being more manipulative . You want to impose your personal and religious morality on everyone else , by giving those who don't share your beliefs , fewer rights .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The manipulation came when gays married in Mass attempted to use the " Full Faith and Credit Clause as a means to force the acceptance of gay marriage on te rest of the contry . The Full Faith and Credit Clause was never intended , nor does it apply to marriage laws . The FFaCC holds for court judgements , but not licenses . It's no different that having a driver's license in MI at age 16 , but not being allowed to drive in NY until you're 18 , even if you hold a valid MI driver's license . There are dozens of such precedents for not acknowledging licenses issued in other states . The 10th Amendment says that those rights not specifically given to the Feds belong to the State or individuals . In many states , the people have decided whether or not gay marriage should be allowed and have exercised their 10th Amendment right to self-govern . Now , you can argue all you want about the net effect of that self-governing , but it is entirely constitutional .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>184<br>S1 is in favor of marriage between homosexual couples.  Within his debate he brings up the Republican use of "hot-button" issues, insinuating that gay marriage is an issue used to divide and distract from other "bread and butter" issues, mentioning tax breaks for the rich and global warming.  He disagrees with decisions being made that affect private affairs including gay marriage and also mentions abortion.  He also brings up the issue of morality being a part of the conversation when one's morality and beliefs is not everyone else's.
S2 believes that gay marriage is wrong because of the traditional role of marriage.  He claims that he does not care much about what people do in their own time but draws the line at allowing same sex marriage.  He accuses democrats and the left of pushing a radical agenda.  He specifically accuses the left of manipulating the system.  He ends with defending states' rights to not acknowledge gay marriage comparing it to the right of states to not acknowledge a driver's licence if not fitting into their requirements.<br><b> key:   </b>1-10824_2_1__4_5_7_8_10_13_17_19_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>A very well put editorial that asks and question I have wondered a number of times myself , and have brought up before .

They are very loud and clear on this point . They would put their personal opinions in to law that subjugate gay people . President Obama has said that he believes that marriage is between a man and a woman but he is not willing to put his personal beliefs into law . He has done everything he can to support the marriage equality position . He has said that he favors a system of strong civil unions . Besides if Obama wins reelection then he will come out for full marriage equality . No other president in US history has done more for the gay community the president Obama . He has been our strong advocate in the white house . The problem for you is that you fall on the side of imposing your moral views upon others and can not understand why someone would not want to .

But once again to the OP Obama is not given a pass on marriage equality it is just that he will never do anything to stop it and will help marriage equality become a reality .

There is not much being said to support his argument, most of the conversation is dominated by S2.  He argues that economic issues are more likely to hurt those in the gay rights movement than any possible laws.
S2 has concerns about the possibility of creating a true second class citizens of  the GLBTQ community.  He refers to President Obama of being the only politician to put his beliefs aside and support gay marriage.  He references past injustices to support his claims that it is possible that gays will be lawfully discriminated against.  He mentions Native Americans and the genocide they experienced; Japanese Americans and the internment camps; African Americans and past slavery.  He worries that history will be allowed to repeat itself in the form of discrimination of homosexuals and points out recent attempts at renewing sodomy laws by some politicians.  At the end he seems to be in favor of an amendment to the Constitution to protect gay rights.<br><b> key:   </b>1-1281_466_275__483_561_576_625_633_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Give us a break , the bibe saying ' in the future there will be Wars ... and Earthquakes !

Abortions an unwed couples seems to have pretty much nothing to do with the last line . As for minorities and the constitution , the majority can change the constitution or just ignore it . It is in the majorities interest to support and accept minorities because pretty much everyone falls within one of them and minorites still have a significant number of people , maybe not the most important but enough to swing power between forces competting over the majority .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The number of earthquales that have happened outside of Israel in the last 100 yrs is exponentially increased .

I haven't been argued that homosexuality is right according to religious beleifs , but more often that your religious beleifs should have nothing to do with my life . Acceptance of homosexuality effecting plate tectonics ? Time to come back to the real world , even if it is true , why should you worship a being that is quite happy to destroy homes and kill people for becoming more tolerant but is quite happy with the famine and AIDS situation and doesn't get involved with politics ?

Reread the posts I'm only refuting his assertions . I did not say homosexuality is the cause of anything religious only citing support against Jake's comments . Don't ever try to assume you know God's mentality . Most parents love their children but they raise them according to how they feel is best . According tro what they know . Why are some parents motivator and others discipliners ? That's my popint if the majority want it they will do it . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And I refute your refutations . You implied that the Earthquakes were not a natural thing and dinviinly caused Even if there is a god , any ' loving parent ' that kills some of its children to make a point , when they are fully capable of just changing the issue anyway is hardly deserving of worship . As for people changing , not only is that dubious anyway but not really proof of anything , there are alcoholics who recover and don't drink and that is definitely genetically influenced . You clearly have no real idea about the state of genetic research or how it works , we are nowhere near finding the purpose of everything . There doesn't appear to be one gene , but there is probably a combination that lead to a greater chance of being gay . @ Rev , Power of Attorney would be fine , but giving that there is already favouritism shown to some people , why should that favouritism be arteficailly restricted .

For someoen that claims there is no God it's amazing how you're the expert now on the nature of God . i agree there is a disposition but that doesn't mean that they are genetically confined as the alcoholic isn't .

Perhaps some people are capable of thinking from another's point of view , if God is a loving parent I can't see how you can justify the view that anything lethal can be used as a punishment . I don't think you know how genetics works in this instance . Or do you think that the method of upbringing they have is purely responisble ? I don't really see any real problem with polygamy itself , but it would have to be watched a little more carefully perhaps as the cultures that practise polygamy tend to be less focused on equality between sexs . As long as you make sure that the marriages are still volentary for both partners and that any person is fully able to leave if they want to then I can't really see the problem . However it is a lot more complicated if you are looking from the benefits point of view with respect to inheritance and other aspects ( child support and suchlike ) but these are realitively minor points that would just have to be worked out if this type of marriage was to be recognised<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>177<br>S1 dominates the debate.  He is against using religion, specifically Biblical references in the conversation around gay marriage.  His first comment seems to be arguing against a previous mention of increased earthquakes and wars.  He also argues for the inclusion and support of minority issues despite the fact that we live in a majority rule state.  He argues that first, most people fall into some sort of minority classification and second the minorities are still large in number.  There is a change in the conversation about half way through to genetics in which compares sexuality to a predisposition for alcoholism.  In the end he feels marriage must be consensual and that any parties may be free to leave, whether it is traditional, homosexual or polygamy.
S2 mostly argues the religious points, for example citing the increase in earthquakes outside of Israel in recent years though he mentions another name of who began the conversation around religion.  He questions why the debate remains around homosexuals and whether polygamists fall into similar categories in the genetic argument.<br><br><b>worker_id </b>A13I60JU7P5URT<br>HITid:</b>  341H3G5YF0E8GR1XNTWQKKDH73Q0ZV<br> <b>Status:</b>Approved<br><b> key:   </b>1-6646_209_208__210_211_212_214_215_239_7 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>[ QUOTE = gaetano ; 255273 ] As you say , marriage is a public institution and like all institutions has its rules and requirements .

If society had set up the institution of marriage as a gay one since OG was in his cave then I would certainly try and lobby otherwise if I disagreed . If the lobbying failed and the rest of Society said we keep things the way we want them however sorry they may feel , then I would clearly have to abide by that , although lobbying would continue . However castigating people because of their beliefs or stating they shouldn't have them , must be wrong . Otherwise I could claim that you are not entitled to your beliefs which clearly you are<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That is not what I asked you . Do you really lack any empathy ? I didn't ask you what you would do I asked you how you would feel . Let's try again How would you feel if the world was the other way around ?

Can you not put youself in the place of gay people and ask yourself how would I feel ? Do you have any empathy ? For the record I do not believe I have the right to tell anyone who they should be allowed to marry but many of those that are anti same sex marriage think that they have a right to tell people who they should be allowed to marry . Just because something happens all the time does not mean it is not cruel and unjust . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>First of all it is not against " someone else's beliefs " in that incredibly simplistic way . It is against the beliefs of society since the year dot , religious beliefs or ' ikk ' factor whatever that is are irrelevant even if they contribute to some people's attitudes . Second yes I would probably feel sad if I wasn't allowed to marry the person I was with BUT I would be with the person I love in any event . Thirdly , as marriage is looked on as a public institution then Society as a whole is entitled to lay down the rules relating to it just as Society lays down the rules and laws by which we live . Cruelty and injustice occur when you are stopped from doing something you are entitled to do . Gay marriage at present is not something you are entitled to it would seem . Have to say in the UK we have made some steps towards that .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I really think you can not put yourself in someone elses place . So you believe that " Cruelty and injustice occur when you are stopped from doing something you are entitled to do . " ? Is this correct ? So if I use your belief on another topic , say slavery , you then would conclude that slavery was neither cruel nore injust 1 since it was a legal and traditional activity practiced since OG was in the cave 2 slaves should not think it was cruel and unjust because they had no legal rights and standing and thus was not cruel and unjust since they were slaves . My point is just because something is the law or not the law does not make it any less cruel or unjust when viewed from a certain perspective . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Firstly I am not even going to put slavery on the same level as gay marriage . I frankly do not believe that the alleged suffering gays not being allowed to marry comes in any way close to the suffering of slaves . Secondly you are of course perfectly correct about cruelty and injustice ( neither or certainly the first one do I think apply to gay marriage ) and the way forward was to lobby etc as Wilberforce did to abolish slave trade . We can only advance in civilisation ( I hope ) but lobbying publicity etc can help people's awareness in bring matters before their eyes to decide on . There will always be minorities of dissenters ( strange world if none ) but in the last analysis Society determines how it is run . You talk about the tyranny of the majority but of course the reverse can also be true .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I am not comparing the two . I am using your own beliefs and statements and appling them to slavery .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>178<br>S1 believes that the best way to legalize same sex marriage is through lobbying.  He thinks that in any discrepancy both sides should lobby and the one who has the majority support should win. Society is run by the majority opinion and he agrees that this is how it should be.  He agrees that same sex marriage should be legal but that the only way it can and should happen is when the majority believes it, even if roles were reversed and his relationship was not able to be acknowledged as a marriage.  When S2 compares marriage inequality to slavery he disagree that the comparison is valid but continues his argument for lobbying citing Wilberforce in his fight to abolish slavery.
S2 attempts to appeal to S1's emotions by repeatedly asking that he put himself in the shoes of those who are being denied the right to marriage.  He questions S1's ability to feel empathy and compares the issue of marriage equality to slavery in regards to the majority allowing it to exist.<br><b> key:   </b>1-10349_9_5__17_40_43_50_52_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>The cultural meaning of marriage is a formalization of a mating pair , who , in turn , create and support a family unit . Love and reproduction are implied . The legal meaning of marriage is , in most States , a contract between two people who are not under the age of consent , of different genders , of the same species , not closely related and who are not already married . Homosexuals are not a part of the traditional or cultural meaning of marriage . In order to be included , the meaning of marriage would have to change . The catch-22 is that homosexual couples want to be included in the current meaning of marriage , but what gives marriage meaning specifically excludes homosexual couples .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That's your definition . It is certainly not my definition . You don't speak for all of society . I personally define marriage as a union of two people who love one another and wish to make a commitment to one another . If marriage is about reproduction , why does nobody bat an eye when a 65 year old woman marries a 68 year old man ? If you believe marriage is " formalization of a mating pair " , and " reproduction is implied " , doesn't this cheapen the institution of marriage in your eyes ? Obviously , they are not getting married to start a family ... perhaps love is what is important ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Mating pairs exist with or without marriage , and have no legal connection with marriage ( since , legally , it doesn't matter if the two people even like one another , or ever intend on consumating said marriage ) . The only connection between a mating couple and marriage is the connection made on a cultural level . So , logically , the cultural meaning of marriage would be the purpose of a mating couple . While ' purpose ' can mean different things , in this context I daresay most would refer to the evolutionary purpose of a mating couple : reproduction . Love is implied because love brings the couple together for that purpose . While legally a 27 yr old marrying a 70 yr old sugar daddy is not a problem , culturally speaking this marriage is not as meaningful as one that is in-line with the evolutionary purpose I outlined above . You can point to exceptions all you want , but all it does is outline the difference between the legal meaning and the cultural meaning of marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Who gave you the power to decide what is culturally meaningful ? And more importantly , should we legally define marriage based on your perception of " cultural meaning " ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No , you should legally define it any damn way you can get away with . The cultural definition comes from observation .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But who get's to decide that legal definition ... that's the point . In this specific case in point , the anti crowd wishes to limit the rights of others simply based on personally held beliefs ... when no harm is presented to any party involved . In a case such as this , I feel strongly that without a specific vector of harm , we must as a civilized society rule in favor of providing equal rights rather than limit rights of a minority . I think these 4 pages thus far make clear that cultural definition is based on subjective obeservation and personal opinion formed via that observation . Clearly , I and many others here do not share your cultural definition . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>In America the people generally vote on issues , or elect representatives to enact laws . That's how you change the legal definitions . This isn't about equality , snakespit . The title of this thread shows that :P In all seriousness , though , it really isn't about equality . I don't think you have a rational basis upon which to dispute that observation . It is an indisputible fact that the cultural view that has dominated this country ( as evidenced by the definition of marriage ) generally follows evolutionarily sound logic : monogamous pair bonding outside of close familial ties . Inclusion of homosexuals would obviously change that .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>176<br>S1 is focused on the definition of marriage and the cultural definition, both limiting marriage to heterosexual couples.  The cultural definition includes reproduction, he uses the term mating mating pairs.  He argues that this definition automatically excludes homosexuals because they cannot, without outside help, create a family.  He discusses other marriage outside of the norm-a young woman and older man- as being less meaningful than those that fulfill the cultural definition.  He sees it as the job of elected officials and the citizens to change the legal definition of marriage if that is what the majority want.
S2 disagrees with and questions the cultural definition given by S1.  He feels that the main factor in marriage is not reproduction but love and commitment between two individuals.  He challenges the cultural definition with the example of a 65 and 68 year old getting married.  He finds it unfair that a group of people are being excluded from an institution on which they pose no threat to those who are enjoying the status quo.<br><b> key:   </b>1-10349_72_70__75_82_83_84_85_86_87_88_89_90_94_95_99_4 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>I'm speaking of everyone who lives in the society ... it's implicit that we agree to live by the laws of that society :P A social contract , if you will .

That if anyone has benefits you don't get then it must be unconstitutional .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I have had this idea for years . http://www.4forums.com/political/gay...man-woman.html <br><b>S1:4-  </b>lol , so what ? You've also been braying about how if some people have benefits that you don't have access to ( and in your scenario it would be much less possible for you to get those benefits ) then it must be unconstitutional . So either you're a hypocrite or you don't actually pay attention to what you say .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I actually have a marriage license . The same license that everyone gets from the state of Iowa , yet my license is not recognized by either the federal government or the state of Michigan , how is that not unconstitutional ? Why are those the only two options ? I want equality and I don't care how it comes about . If my rules where applied to marriage , yes it would suck , but I would then be treated equally to those heteros , who currently do not breed , can not breed , or choose not to breed , yet can get a marriage license at the drop of a hat and have it recognized . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Because the Constitution does not require them to :P It has been long established that States have authority over marriage definitions . Because , gasp , they get marriage benefits while you do not ! Are you saying it's equal for some people to get marriage benefits but single people do not ?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>What is it about the same piece of paper you do not understand ? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>The reason you have that paper is the same reason other States don't have to honor it . That reason is : States decide for themselves what constitutes a marriage . I'm still interested in the fact that you're ok with some people getting marriage benefits and others not getting them .<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Once again the state of Iowa issues one piece of paper to everyone . What part of that do you not understand ? The other states and the federal government must recognize all or none . If marriage is to be about breeders and breeding children , and my rules are adopted by the state then yes I am alright . If my rules were adopted then almost no one would get married , and those who get married have to breed if they don't they are no longer married . They have to have 3 witnesses to their act of breeding , along with a video of the event stored in the public records of the county were they live . <br><b>S1:7-  </b>I understand every part of that . Nothing makes States recognize all or none , Matthew S. In fact , it's been true since the ratification that States establish their own marriage laws ... and anyone in the State is subject to those marriage laws . It doesn't matter what other States say about your marriage because you're not in those States . No you aren't because some people would have marriage benefits but you will not . You've been very vocal that if anyone gets marriage benefits when you do not then it must be unconstitutional . Are you now saying that it's perfectly Constitutional for only some people to get marriage benefits ? And you're wrong , of course . People would get married . Besides ' having witnesses ' ( which is for the signing of the contract not the execution , duh ) , a lifelong relationship with children is the ideal marriage . It's what people hope to have .<br><b> S2:7-  </b>And why would gay people be any different ? What we have is you saying to me that I can't get married because you have some belief against it . I wish I could say to you , you can't go to that place or do that thing because I have a belief against you doing so . <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Saying heterosexuals are the same as homosexuals is political fiction . At some point you'll have to realize that biological differences exist and sometimes that has ramifications for how you're treated . It's a bit like being left-handed ; the world is sort of built around people being rightys . Sorry . You're sitting there demanding the world be changed to suit leftys as if it is your due , while at the same time casually denying that anything was made for rightys in the first place . It's insulting , ignorant and arrogant . I'd oppose you for those reasons alone :P You can . You really can . All you need is for a lot of people to agree with you .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>179<br>S1 sees marriage as it is today as part of a social contract that is based upon biology and reproduction.  The drive to reproduce is part of the heterosexual bond and marriage is its formalization.  S1 is annoyed with S2 demanding that because his marriage is not universally recognized that there is something unconstitutional in place.  He explains that marriage is left to the States to determine what is legal and that the Federal government, according to the Constitution, has no place to change that.
S2 would like to see a change in the definition of marriage.  He holds a marriage licence but it is not universally recognized. He argues that biology and reproduction do not apply when people past the age where childbearing is possible can marry.  He challenges S1 that if marriage truly is about reproduction and family that a married couple must prove that this is a part of their relationship or their marriage would be terminated.  He is offended that others' beliefs can play a role in his life.<br><br><b>worker_id </b>A13I60JU7P5URT<br>HITid:</b>  3GV1I4SEO9PJPD68AHLYL6CA5X3L6X<br> <b>Status:</b>Approved<br><b> key:   </b>1-5672_18_7__22_24_25_29_30_33_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Yes it does , because what is happening here is that ' family ' and ' marriage ' are being redefined .

That criteria IS traditional marriage , and if that changes that in Colson's eyes traditional marriage IS affected . I don't see how you can say that adopting gay marriage has no effect on that . I've heard Colson speak , BTW ; he speaks all over the country . I agree with some of what he's said and some I don't . He would say the same thing about kids raised in single parent homes ; but it's not that he's saying single parent homes are bad ; he's saying that homes with a mother and father are the best scenario . I think that's what he's saying here too . He's basically saying that by his observations of prisons , that traditional families do best in terms of raising children and them staying out of prison .

I've agreed with the gay rights stance on gay adoption . I've agreed that gays shouldn't have to face job and housing discrimination . I've agreed on numerous things . Those aren't instances of disagreement , but of agreement . Maybe I just haven't often found your comments agreeable .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes , I know . You may remember that I pointed out your opposition to the amendment to another poster just the other day . It's precisely the discrepancy between your stated beliefs and your constant arguments in opposition to them that lead people to believe that you do not , in fact , support gay rights . There are other possibilities , of course . Personally , I've latched onto the idea that you're paid to be here . I realize it's a bit silly , but , frankly , it's the least morally repugnant one I can come up with , and I hate to think ill of people I don't know . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>What evv .

Can you describe the hand gestures that went with that ?<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>182<br>S1 begins by defending Colson, who does not appear directly in the conversation but primarily deals with issues of single parenthood in favor of traditional families.  This then carries into the debate on same sex marriage arguing the family structure is not as secure, even looking at whether or not children of non traditional families end up in prison at higher rates.  S1's argument gets confused when he later states that he is in favor of sex sex adoption, quite contrary to the beliefs of Colson whom he was initially defending.  He also speaks in favor of protects for homosexual relationships and individuals and against the amendment that would prevent gay marriage.
S2 takes issue with what Colson argues pointing out that single parenthood has not been attacked politically through attempts at amendments.   He mostly questions S1's validity, accusing him of being paid to post.  There is not much opinion being given from S2 but rather objections to much of what S1 has said both in the current text as well as mentions of previous debates.<br><b> key:   </b>1-5672_6_5__7_13_15_16_17_20_2 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Actually , I think it's probably the most compelling argument I've read for the amendment . The be fair , I don't think the author is claiming there is a direct link between gay marriage and crime . He seems to be talking about overall effect on society and traditional family . But I'm still against the amendment ; amending the constitution over something like this is just not the right thing to do .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>" compelling argument " ? So do you believe the basis of what he's claiming ? And are you ready to debate it ? Because there is no " overall effect on society and traditional family " from gay marriage . The " traditional family " has been having its OWN problems , and has been in decline in these countries LONG BEFORE gay marriage ever was legalized . It's like a guy jumping out of an airplane , and he starts falling to the ground . Three seconds later gay marriage is legalized , and conservatives want to blame the fact that he's falling on gay marriage ... It makes no sense . There is no causality here ... Do straight people say , " Hey ! Gay marriage is legal . I don't want to get married now . " Do straight people say , " Hey ! Gay marriage is legal . I want to get a divorce now . " The " most compelling argument " lacks any semblance of sense . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes it does , because what is happening here is that ' family ' and ' marriage ' are being redefined . It is being broadened . People like Colson believe that marriage and family fits a certain criteria for it to truly be a marriage .

I don't see how you can say that it DOES have an effect on that . Tell me , for starters , WHAT effect it will happen . Will Colson get a divorce if gay marriage is legalized ? Will Colson wish he had never gotten married if gay marriage is legalized ? THEY are claiming SPECIFIC effects . NEGATIVE effects . Effects that should be PROVEN for them to be claimed ... HOW can they claim those SPECIFIC DETRIMENTAL effects from gay marriage onto OTHER PEOPLE's marriages ??? Where's the proof ? 1 ) Studies DO back-up the issue of " single vs dual parent house-holds " . And that is common sense . Two heads are better than one . Twice the capability to care . 2 ) Studies REFUTE the claims that dual heterosexual parents are better than dual gay parents . They aren't . Gay parents are just as good . The gender of the parents are irrelevant . The sexual orientation of the parents is irrelevant . Where did I misrepresent something Jyoshu ? He's claiming a SPECIFIC DETRIMENTAL EFFECT on families due to gay marriage . THAT is what I'm talking about . THAT is what I want proven , if he's going to claim it . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Easy . . . marriage in the defined sense will be changed . It will be more broadened . Where did he claim that ? All I see is that he feels that traditional families are better in terms of kids from them staying out of prison . It seemed to me you were representing this as someone ' blaming ' gay marriage for crime . If that's not what you meant , then fair enough .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Is that ALL the effect you are claiming then ? Are you then contradicting the previous article's claim that it will have a negative effect on heterosexual marriages ? Did you read the article Jyoshu ? Do you even know what we're talking about ? Again , did you READ the article Jyoshu ? Because if not , then why did you claim : " Actually , I think it's probably the most compelling argument I've read for the amendment . " For Jyoshu's edification : If you don't comprehend that is PRECISELY what the author IS doing , then I don't know what to tell you . It's there in black and white ! <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I never said I was compelled , or convinced by the article . I said it was probably the most compelling that I've seen . I see nothing in that quote blaming gay marriage for crime , directy OR even indirectly . You are making an inference --o ne that may or may NOT be intended . I would think if Colson's point was to lay blame for crime he would have simply said so . He didn't . Colson is simply opposing thge amendment because he believes that traditional families are best in terms of avoiding crime . I don't really agree either -- I think there are too many variables for that to automatically be the case .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Oh . I see . So if somebody said " Christianity causes cancer " , that would be a compelling argument for people to not be Christians . Right ? Give me a freakin ' break Jyoshu . READ the article . It's talking about gay marriage and the effects of it on society . It makes claims that : 1 ) Gay marriage will cause detriment to straight marriages . 2 ) Detriment to straight marriages , e.g. single parent families , yield greater instances of criminals . It's all right there . In plain English . I am making no " inference " . This IS what the author is saying . Then explain to me his next paragraph where he links LEGALIZATION of gay marriage to a decrease in " traditional families " . Can't you put two and two together ? And Colson is not " opposing " the amendment . He's SUPPORTING it . From the article : " This is just one reason that I am so passionately in favor of the Marriage Protection Amendment ... " Can't you even get THAT right ? Or are you so lost in obfuscation that you've confused yourself ?<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>181<br>S1 considers Colson's article on gay marriage to be compelling.  He reads it as a comment on society generally, defends the author's views on traditional families and does not see it as a direct attack on same sex marriage. He refers to the statistics on children of traditional families being at a lower risk of ending up in prison.  He later mentions that he does not necessarily agree with this conclusion that was drawn by Colson.
S2 argues against any protection of the traditional family pointing out that it has been having its own issues.  He sees Colson's article as a direct attack on any family other than what has been labeled traditional- two heterosexual parents raising children.  He believes that the article is inferring that homosexual parents would end up raising children who commit crimes.  He also argues with the concept that homosexual marriages will have a direct negative impact on heterosexual marriages mentioning that any claims need to be backed up to be reliable that there is nothing to back up any claims on this issue.<br><b> key:   </b>1-10585_36_34__39_52_54_64_65_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Bert and Ernie are not gay !!

This is what makes me so sick about your hypocrisy . You seperate the sex from marriage just when it suits you . You want two male characters to be homosexual and take out the homosexual sex element just when it suits you . But two men could live together and be extremely close without being homosexual .. the homosexual element comes in at the genital fondling stage . You know it but cry ' dirty minds ' when this is stated . Pathetic and Miss piggy and kermit are interspecies but not portrayed as sexually active but gays like you want us to believe bert and ernie are .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No . You can portray some of the straight human characters as being married , without it being anything close to an adult sex film . In this case , some are just saying they would like two charcters who are both male to be married . Straight or gay can discuss the fact of marriage , without getting into sex act details or even touching the topic of sex acts . I believe that , and if you don't when it comes to gays , it is indeed you who has the dirty mind where the topic at hand is concerned . Who else has mentioned sex acts ? No one . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Well once we you have same sex marriages then you may have straight men marrying . There may be advantages in this for some straight men .

One does not need to actually show or discuss the sexual acts of people when describing their sexuality ... you are the one that is stupidly suggesting this .

Straight De emphasise the fact that the people who want them to be married are homosexuals more Straight Thats what homosexuals do isnt it ?<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>189<br>S1 finds the argument that Bert and Ernie could be homosexuals extremely offensive arguing that characters created for children's programs should not be sexualized at all. This leads into the topic of gay marriage and gay sex which he labels as deviant.  He questions whether two straight men would marry simply for the benefits of marriage if same sex marriage was legalized.  He accuses S2 and other homosexuals of wanting Bert and Ernie to have a same sex marriage, which would include "playing with their genitals".
S2 never comes out and says he believes Bert and Ernie are gay but argues for them to be allowed to be in a same sex relationship.  Throughout his arguments he differentiates between the relationship and sexual behaviors.  He mentions other relationships in children's programs like Kermit and Miss Piggy and the lack of sexualization when dealing with couples of the opposite sex.  He refutes S1's claims that men will marry with the idea that they already can marry women and would not have to get into a same sex relationship to get the benefits of marriage.</p><br><br><b>worker_id </b>ASBSFVA7H9OMU<br>HITid:</b>  3KTCJ4SCVG18O9NW4NAWQN0IXREM13<br> <b>Status:</b>Approved<br><b> key:   </b>1-10951_14_13__15_16_18_20_21_22_23_24_30_31_32_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>In the end you godless heathens will be in Hell and we'll be on the other side of the great divide looking down on your endless misery , just like in the story of the Rich Man and Lazarus .

If you don't follow the rules you don't qualify for the benefits . The fact that thereare rules does not mean anyone is barred from the custom .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And those rules used to include race as a qualifier for marriage . Neither blacks nor whites were allowed to marry outside of their race . Rights were applied equally based upon the confines of this criteria . If whom you wanted to marry fell outside of this criteria you were not allowed to wed . This is the same principal you are using to show equal rights amongst hetero and homo sexual people . The only difference is that as it stands now race has been removed from the criteria as it was viewed to be inappropriate and discriminatory . The gay marriage proponents are now advocating that gender be removed from the same criteria as it is also inappropriate and discriminatory . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Except they were demonstratably unequal . A black person could not marry those that a white person could marry , and white people were barred from marriage to those that black people were not barred from . Currently , there is no barrier that homosexual people have that heterosexual people do not share . The two situations are dissimilar . As long as there are any rules , this will be true . No-one may marry someone already married , an animal , a minor , or a sibling . There is nothing wrong with trying to change the status quo , but you don't have a right to the changes you want . They are just changes you want .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Yes , the qualifying criteria for marriage at the time was unequal which is why race was removed from criteria . But anyone who wanted to get married had to meet this criteria which was applied to everyone . This is the same argument that you are using to prove that there is no inequality between hetrosexuals and homosexuals . Yes , there is . A heterosexual couple can get married . A homosexual couple cannot . Your objection is a semantic one . Admittedly , no one has the right to marriage . But again I will reiterate . That is not the issue . The issue is homosexual couples cannot get married while heterosexual couples can . In so doing the government recognizes the heterosexual couple as significant members of the same family and award that couple benefits which include the ability to visit one another in a hospital , the ability to make impotortant life decisions if one of the members should become incompasitated , the ability to cover one another under their insurance , the ability to file taxes jointly , the ability to purchase property together and survivorship rights of said property , inheritance rights , and many others . These priveleges are being denied to homosexual couples . Not people , couples . They are being denied the above privelges not because the don't deserve them but because some people don't like the idea of them having sex . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not the criteria . The effect . Except that neither the qualifying criteria nor the effect is unequal between heterosexual and homosexual individuals . True , but couples do not have rights , individuals do . Agreed . I think it's more complicated than that , but that is essentially so . Heterosexual relationships are perceived as somehow more valid or as having a purpose that homosexual relationships lack . This is true ( if " purpose " is the right word ) on an evolutionary level , so the view has some validity . Of course , that should have no automatic policy implications but it would explain some of the resistance to the idea .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Agreed . Rights may not be the correct word . But there are benefits that heterosexual couples can obtain and homosexual couples cannot . Agreed .

Argues that the denial of marriage between races as discrimination is not similar to argument based on gender. Based on the rules, the barriers of marriage are the same for both heterosexual and homosexual couples and therefore one group is not being discriminated against. Just as no one can marry someone that is already married, an animal, or a minor, there are rules. He concedes that there is nothing wrong with changing something that is commonly agreed upon as need changing, but as it's not the case, homosexuals cannot have a change just because they want it. 
S2 is of the opinion that just like race was found to be a discriminatory qualifier for the criteria of marriage, so should a couple's gender be found discriminatory criteria also. He says that it is not just the custom that's denied, it's their rights as individuals in a relationship to obtain benefits, to visit in the hospital, or to purchase property together.<br><b> key:   </b>1-9391_370_363_1_371_372_373_374_376_377_378_384_385_389_390_391_392_394_395_11 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Its nothing like racial segregation ....<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It's everything like racial segregation and every kind of segregation throughout the course of history .

He insists that he made no position about what segregation means definitely. He insists further that he didn't imply the plight of blacks and gays were dissimilar.
S2 argues with S1 about what he believes the speaker actually meant from his statement. His first point is adamantly made, that the segregation of blacks is in actuality just like the segregation that is faced by homosexuals. He insists that the prejudice that they face is just like the previous prejudices, that in their time were also seen as as 'different'. He also claims that the statement implies that if the segregation of blacks were imposed on homosexuals, that it would not be less wrong.

He repeatedly cites Christianity and the Gospels as sources of information that back him up in this belief.  He challenges the other writer to prove the Gospels are fiction and that Christ's resurrection is false.  Failure to do so means failure to disprove that homosexuals will suffer forever in Hell.  He also says that President Obama's involvement with gay rights proves that Obama has no spiritual credibility.

S2 does not believe homosexuals will suffer forever in Hell after they die.  He does not believe proving his stance requires him to disprove the Gospels.  He suggests that whenever the other writer has no proof to offer, he relies on insults.  Further, he suggests the other writer's words and attitude are hypocritical in terms of Christian religious values.  In response to the President Obama reference, he focuses on the other writer's news source.  He doesn't believe Fox News is a credible news source, and sees its use as weakening the debate.<br><b> key:   </b>1-9391_518_516__520_523_526_531_539_8 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>I'm saying that the limit to opposite sexes is one limit among others . If you don't follow the rules you don't qualify for the benefits . The fact that thereare rules does not mean anyone is barred from the custom .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And those rules used to include race as a qualifier for marriage . Neither blacks nor whites were allowed to marry outside of their race . Rights were applied equally based upon the confines of this criteria . If whom you wanted to marry fell outside of this criteria you were not allowed to wed . This is the same principal you are using to show equal rights amongst hetero and homo sexual people . The only difference is that as it stands now race has been removed from the criteria as it was viewed to be inappropriate and discriminatory . The gay marriage proponents are now advocating that gender be removed from the same criteria as it is also inappropriate and discriminatory . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Except they were demonstratably unequal . A black person could not marry those that a white person could marry , and white people were barred from marriage to those that black people were not barred from . Currently , there is no barrier that homosexual people have that heterosexual people do not share . The two situations are dissimilar . As long as there are any rules , this will be true . No-one may marry someone already married , an animal , a minor , or a sibling . There is nothing wrong with trying to change the status quo , but you don't have a right to the changes you want . They are just changes you want .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Yes , the qualifying criteria for marriage at the time was unequal which is why race was removed from criteria . But anyone who wanted to get married had to meet this criteria which was applied to everyone . This is the same argument that you are using to prove that there is no inequality between hetrosexuals and homosexuals . Yes , there is . A heterosexual couple can get married . A homosexual couple cannot . Your objection is a semantic one . Admittedly , no one has the right to marriage . But again I will reiterate . That is not the issue . The issue is homosexual couples cannot get married while heterosexual couples can . In so doing the government recognizes the heterosexual couple as significant members of the same family and award that couple benefits which include the ability to visit one another in a hospital , the ability to make impotortant life decisions if one of the members should become incompasitated , the ability to cover one another under their insurance , the ability to file taxes jointly , the ability to purchase property together and survivorship rights of said property , inheritance rights , and many others . These priveleges are being denied to homosexual couples . Not people , couples . They are being denied the above privelges not because the don't deserve them but because some people don't like the idea of them having sex . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not the criteria . The effect . Except that neither the qualifying criteria nor the effect is unequal between heterosexual and homosexual individuals . True , but couples do not have rights , individuals do . Agreed . I think it's more complicated than that , but that is essentially so . Heterosexual relationships are perceived as somehow more valid or as having a purpose that homosexual relationships lack . This is true ( if " purpose " is the right word ) on an evolutionary level , so the view has some validity . Of course , that should have no automatic policy implications but it would explain some of the resistance to the idea .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Agreed . Rights may not be the correct word . But there are benefits that heterosexual couples can obtain and homosexual couples cannot . Agreed .

He suggests that couples of any kind, gay or straight, do not have rights.  Individuals are the ones who have rights, but those rights are limited by rules that cannot be changed just because somebody personally wants them changed.  For example, a person does not have the right to marry someone if they are already married, or someone who is a minor.  Further, he believes heterosexual couples can be viewed as more valid on an evolutionary basis.

S2 does not believe there any valid arguments to keep homosexuals from marrying.  He believes the issue of gay marriage is no different than than of marriage between different races.  He also disagrees with the notion that only individuals have rights.  The gay marriage issue is largely about the rights of couples, including the right to visit one another in a hospital, the right to inherit from one another, and the right to file taxes jointly.  He also believes the true reason for people being against gay marriage is disapproval of gays having sex.<br><b> key:   </b>1-9391_370_363_1_371_372_373_374_376_377_378_384_385_389_390_391_392_394_395_11 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Its nothing like racial segregation ....<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It's everything like racial segregation and every kind of segregation throughout the course of history .

But the statement he was responding to is not mentioned in the text.  The statement he was responding to is also not from the other writer (S2), but from someone mentioned later as Addison.  S1 believes the other writer (S2) has misunderstood his comment to Addison.  He doesn't believe his words had anything to do with denying the current plight of gay people is similar to the past plight of black people. He believes the other writer is jumping to conclusions, possibly based on information in other posts.

S1 is offended by the other writer's use of the phrase, "It's nothing like racial segregation."  He believes the words are about the possibility of segregating gay people.  He the words imply that the segregation of gay people would either be nothing like the past treatment of black people, or would be less wrong.  He believes segregation throughout history is always the same, but people always deny the similarities.  This includes segregation according to race, religion, or sexual orientation.  At one point, he admits he may have interpreted the other writer's words incorrectly.</p></body> </html></body> </html>
