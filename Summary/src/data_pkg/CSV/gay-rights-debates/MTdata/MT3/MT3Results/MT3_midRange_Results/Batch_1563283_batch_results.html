You rail against the Mideastern countries for their treatment of Christians and sharia law , but you are so happy to impose that same sharia law upon us . You are just the same as the Islamists that you despise .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>He has not advocated the execution , imprisonment , or even mandatory therapy for homosexuals that is an unfair accusation . It is the homosexual lobby who are trying to force him and people like him to recognize homosexuality in the public sphere and thus condone and support it , and their reaction to that is the sum of the so called ' gay-bashing ' in modern western countries . That is why I could live in peace with easyrider but not a collectivist , he believes in freedom if only because the founders of the united states did . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>He is advocating that his religious beliefs be turned into laws that I have to live under . Yes he is the Taliban . Yes he wants sharia law imposed upon me and my family .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No , you want your relationship imposed upon him and his family . What religious belief is it that he wants as law ? That homosexuals should be put to death and their blood is on them ? He has not advocated that in all the posts he's made since I've been here . You think you have a right to public support and that is why you have a blindness to the nature of what he wants . Homosexual marriages have not been banned by any state , some refuse to recognize them and that is all . You can still sign any contract with anyone you want . You can still have as much sex as you want with whoever you want . There are no oppressive laws and the sooner you realize that the sooner we all can stop hearing this avalanche of self-absorbed entitled complaints . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It is his religious belief that a civil marriage contract is between a man and a woman . His religious belief is the law and he supports that law . It is a religious law that is no difference then sharia law . His religious beliefs should have nothing to do with civil law . Further my religious beliefs are being violated .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Then how can non-religious people ( like me ) recognize that man and woman has always been what marriage meant ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Because there is such a thing as a legal contract signed between two people and the state , simple as that .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>133<br>S1 labeled someone Mr Taliban and said that this person who is against sharia law is himself imposing that on gays through his religious belief that a civil marriage contract is only for a man and a woman. He said Mr.Taliban's religious beliefs should not have anything to do with civil law. S2 challenged S1's comparison of the man to the Taliban as he has not advocated the execution, jailing, etc. of homosexuals. S2 then stated that is indeed the gay lobby that is attempting to impose its view on the man. S2 concluded by asking S1 to stop complaining as there have been no real violations of S1's rights. S1 said he can have a contract and as much sex as he likes.<br><b> key:   </b>1-10951_34_32__39_41_42_44_3 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>You've got nothing but your usual drivel , denials , whines , and unfounded conjecture .

Until then you're nothing more than a noisy little Christ denier .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>LMAO .. I do believe that is the lamest reply you have ever produced .. It's apparent that you are frustrated and that might be throwing you off a little .... 1 : There were no Eye witness accounts of any resurrection recorded , everything written in the Gospels is hearsay . 2 : there is zero , nada , no evidence left behind of any resurrection ... taking a mythical story for it's literal word and convincing a few billion M o r o n s that it is real does not make it true . 3 : we know from scientific evidence and just from basic human intelligence that once a man dies and is dead for 3 days he does not get up and walk away .. sorry .. I know it hurts . 4 : add in the inconsistencies , the so called " facts " that in no way match with history , the lack of any evidence other than what you have been taught in your cult , and I would assume that the burden of proof for any resurrection would fall on YOU ... but we all know that won't happen so commence with the insults ... Does that mean I get to go to the Pit now ? .... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You might as well drop down into the Pit for all the nonsense you just spewed out . It just another crock pot full of left wing , antichrist dysentery .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If it's so much nonsense then why not give us a first hand account of your overwhelming brilliance and post your evidence to prove me wrong ? See Ezridden that is where you always seem to fail . When faced with facts and reality you always come up short . The really , REALLY ironic part of all this is the fact that if indeed " the pit " really existed and your book of fairy tales was really the key to salvation and all , well according to your own fairy tale and the way you So called " Christians " are supposed to live then You my intelligence challenged friend would be standing right next to me and ole Smiley in that " Pit " you seem to love talking about . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>There's no Sodomites in heaven . You're out of luck ( unless you repent of your stiff-necked disobedience to God ) .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yep smiley pegged you correctly . You can't post the evidence to prove me wrong so you resort to name calling and insult and completely go off topic in hopes that you won't be forced to use that pea brain of yours ... Nice try but you still have nothing ...<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>131<br>S1 attacked S1's lack of belief in the resurrection of Jesus. He said that until S2 presents credible scholarship and good arguments that burst the belief in the resurrection of Jesus he is nothing more than a Christ denier and might as well go into the Pit. And of course since he is gay and is a Sodomite he would not go to heaven unless he repented. 
S2 called S1's reply lame and then proceeded to argue that there were no eyewitness accounts only hearsay, no evidence, etc. and that S1 should be the one to come up with proof. He said to S1, Ezridden, that if the pit really existed then Ezridden would be there too because of how he treats other people.<br><b> key:   </b>1-788_17_16__19_20_21_22_23_26_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>There you go using the " N " word . I suppose you think you are normal too huh ?

Same for the wives toward their husband ? Just curious ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I never stated that the husband or wives were not comitted to each other , I brought up the idea of fidelity .

Are the Democrats now part of the Christian reich , as well ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Somehow , I think it goes a little deeper than party lines .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I believe what we are seeing is a reaction to the heterophobes that want to foist gay marriage upon the rest of America . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>What exactly is a heterophobe , and how are they " foisting " gay marriage upon America ? And tell me please , what exactly is your problem with gay marriage , why are you so opposed to it ?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>When a person is opposed to gay marriage they are often called a homophobe . When a person is opposed to the banning of gay marriage , they must therefore be a heterophobe . Because a have a personal right to be opposed to it , just as you have a right to be for it , if you indeed are . The Constitution of the U.S. gives me this right to be opposed to it , just as it gives you the right to be for it .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>126<br>S1 said that when it comes to the word "normal", fidelity should be looked at and many gays have fidelity in their relationshipso. Isn't fidelity part of the american attitude of " normal "? , he said. He questioned S2's labeling of gay people as heterophobes. He asked S2 what his problem was, why he personally did not want gay marriage.

S2 quoted a CNN poll which found that many people do not want gay marriage, includingm.  He said that when people are opposed to gay marriage  they are often called a homophobe . When a person is opposed to the banning of gay marriage , they must therefore be a heterophobe . He said that he has a right be against gay marriage.<br><b> key:   </b>1-788_12_9__15_31_35_40_2 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>It would lead ultimately down the road to a marriage bill for polygamists . That is why the current push for a Constitutional Amendment to ban gay marriage also contains a provision banning polygamous marriage as well . Hmm .... some opposition to the petition ... More left wing ideology at work .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>If the man after God    s own heart had multiple wives , why can    t I ? :) I have heard others say that we already have polygamy in America . It    s called serial polygamy because of our liberal divorce laws . So now those that are opposed to even more laws on the books and a return to Old Testament practices are considered left wing ? What    s this world coming too ? LOL <br><b>S1:2-  </b>King David having multiple wives was under Old Testament practice . Jesus himself stated that divorce laws were granted by Moses and allowed by God because of the hardness of the people hearts . Jesus said a man shall leave his father and mother and be cleaved to his WIFE , Not WIVES . BTW , its called serial MONOGAMY . If its ' right wing ' to support a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage than its ' left wing ' to oppose a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So is it a sin or just a practice ? I don    t remember Jesus saying polygamy was wrong . The statement you referred to does indicate that he was talking about a single wife , but I wouldn    t base a whole social convention on one word out of a whole book . Anyway the Jews don    t believe in the New Testament . Would it be okay for them ? Man I screwed that one up . I    ll try to be a little more articulate in the future . :) Okay I was just wondering . I base my wing on what I think is correct , not left or right . A few years ago it was right wing to be against the deficit , now it seems to be left wing . But that just shows what I know about wings . LOL <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The idea that it is now left wing to be against deficits is absurd . Numerous Democrats actually wanted to spend more than the Bush Administrations 12.5% increase in federal spending .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I was basing that on your previous statement In other words , anything that is opposed to one wing must be the opposite so I don    t see how it    s absurd unless you want to call your original statement absurd . This is obviously not the thread for this discussion but I will reply this time and see where it takes us . You didn    t state what you considered to be    numerous    nor did you supply anything to back up that statement . However deficits depend on both increased spending and lower revenues . Bush has done both with large tax cuts and large discretionary spending increases . And even the conservatives are beginning to criticize him for being a big spending president . Over the past 23 years ,    conservative    administrations have increased the deficits and    liberal    administrations have decreased the deficits . So yeah it looks to me like left wing is against deficits and right wing is for deficits .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>126<br>S1 stated that the legalization of gay marriage would lead to polygamists getting the right to marry so many laws against gay marriage also outlaw polygamy.  He then said that the Right Wing was against both gay marriage and polygamy while the left wing was for it. He then said that many Democrats were bigger spenders than the Republicans.
S2 said that it was funny to him that those for less laws on the books and a return to the Old Testament practices including polygamy are now considered left wing.  He said that he does what he thinks is right and believes that Jesus is not against polygamy. He said too that the past Democratic presidents left far fewer deficits than the Republican presidents.<br><b> key:   </b>1-5320_25_16__33_34_35_36_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Well ... so far eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue have found that barring same-sex marriage is unconstitutional . We're waiting to hear about three or four more . As for the nature of marriage , it is both a legal contract and ( sometimes ) a religious ceremony ( sacrament in some religions ) . We're stuck with the duality , whether we like it or not , and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect . Different religions can do what they want .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>They found that it violated their state constitutions , right ? This has nothing to do with the US Constitution . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The winning arguments were based largely on state constitutional provisions that closely parallel , if not outright mimmick , the federal constitution .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That's not generally true , is it ? For example , the Massachusetts ruling was based on a specific provision in the Mass . constitution that prohibits discrimination based on sexual preference . There's nothing like that in the US constitution . And my overall point was that we should be careful when calling something " unconstitutional " , in that we should be clear it we're talking state or federal constitution . Many state constitutions guarantee rights that aren't in the fedral constitution . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>There's nothing like that in the Mass . Constitution either . Though , it's a darned good idea ! Goodrich was decided on equal protection grounds , citing the Mass . document . I'd have to look up the others to see the exact reasoning , but they're not likely to be far afield from the bedrock principles of equal protection and due process . Gay rights is a real test of our constitutional system , and , so far , we're not passing with flying colors ...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're right , I misremembered . It's just descrimination based on sex that's banned .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>123<br>S1 stated that eight out of nine state supreme courts have found that disallowing same sex marriage is unconstitutional and these states had constitutions which are similar to the U.S. Constitution. There continues to be the dual nature of marriage with the courts having to decide about it legally. Now the religions have to interpret it as they will. He closed with, " Gay rights is a real test of our constitutional system , and , so far , we're not passing with flying colors."
S2 questioned if they found that it violated their State constitutions alone or if it was the violation of the Federal Constitution that mattered in these cases. Many state constitutions guarantee rights that aren't in the federal constitution .<br><br><b>worker_id </b>A2TJHKHM8T2SV3<br>HITid:</b>  3DWNFENNE3VZF0EUO8G68TF446T4J7<br> <b>Status:</b>Rejected<br><b> key:   </b>1-9390_2_1__3_6_7_8_10_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Gay activists love to compare public disapproval of homosexuality with racial discrimination .

When challenged by S2, S1 said that if S2 was ever fired it would be for incompetence not for being gay. S2 questioned if S1 meant that disapproval and discrimination were the same thing. He then repeatedly questioned how his sitting down post in his pajamas being gay could be exhibiting any bad behavior to be disapproved of and asked S2 to define a  "Gay Activist." He then said that in many States he could easily get fired just for being gay without any incompetence.<br><b> key:   </b>1-35_148_147__149_151_152_155_156_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Most Christians don't try to do that to gay people either .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Sure they do .

Gay husband is not a legally recognized category . Agreed , when the wife is part of a hetero relationship . Gay wife is not a legally recognized category . Agreed , when the spouse is part of a hetero relationship . Gay spouse is not a legally recognized category .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem . What is the reason it's not legally recognized ? Because the couple is gay . Where do you get the figure of 500,000 gay couples who want to immediately be married ? Would these gay couples beat the straight couples in some kind of a race to the weddings occurring at the same time , or occurring over the course of a month or a year ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>They're not legally recognized because they don't meet the legal criteria for marriage , ie one man , one woman . A cat doesn't meet the legal definition of a dog . Do we change the definition of dog to appease the cat ? That's the real question to be answered by society . Actually , I pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only , but after reading the CBO report , I see that I wasn't far off . They predicted 600,000 gay couples would want to get married it allowed .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This is circular reasoning however . It's stating that marriage simply is heterosexual , and so completely ends debate . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Exactly my point , just as a cat can never be considered a dog just because someone wants it to be . To me , and I'm guessing millions of others , the term gay marriage is an oxymoron . That's not to say that we shouldn't consider the possibility of allowing gay unions with , possibly , equivalent rights to hetero couples if we , as a society , see the benefit in doing so . For example , prior to FDR , the concept of state welfare was considered ludicrous and unconstitutional , but he was able to get enough support ( and enough political muscle ) to change society's mind on the role of the Federal gov't once he demonstrated the " good " that doing so had on America in its most dire time of need . People were willing to sacrifice a little freedom for security just as Ben Franklin had warned against . Now , I'll be the first to tell you that I think FDR was the biggest threat to American freedom that ever existed , but one can't argue his ability to change public opinion on the role of the Federal gov't .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It concerns reason , as Jaxian said earlier .

S2 said that S2's comment that marriage is for heterosexuals seems to be an attempt to end the debate. He 
said that the fact that homosexual marriage is not recognized is the problem.

It    s called serial polygamy because of our liberal divorce laws . So now those that are opposed to even more laws on the books and a return to Old Testament practices are considered left wing ? What    s this world coming too ? LOL <br><b>S1:2-  </b>King David having multiple wives was under Old Testament practice . Jesus himself stated that divorce laws were granted by Moses and allowed by God because of the hardness of the people hearts . Jesus said a man shall leave his father and mother and be cleaved to his WIFE , Not WIVES . BTW , its called serial MONOGAMY . If its ' right wing ' to support a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage than its ' left wing ' to oppose a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So is it a sin or just a practice ? I don    t remember Jesus saying polygamy was wrong . The statement you referred to does indicate that he was talking about a single wife , but I wouldn    t base a whole social convention on one word out of a whole book .

This is obviously not the thread for this discussion but I will reply this time and see where it takes us . You didn    t state what you considered to be    numerous    nor did you supply anything to back up that statement . However deficits depend on both increased spending and lower revenues . Bush has done both with large tax cuts and large discretionary spending increases . And even the conservatives are beginning to criticize him for being a big spending president .

He also understood the need for war when it comes to pursuing , perserving and maintaining liberty ( " the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots & tyrants . It is its natural manure " ) . He believed liberty was threatened by a consolidated , centralized government , which is radically different than liberalism today , which takes the very opposite stance , IMO . Decentralization was a big theme to Jefferson . He would have opposed over-regulation . Liberalism today has abandoned a lot of what Jefferson believed , kept what they prefer , and changed it . There are many aspects of HIS liberalism I would agree with : I like their focus on domestic social issues such as taking care of elderly , making sure there is fairness , freedom for black people , etc. But liberalism as embodied today by the Democratic party has become anti-religion , over-regulatory , and it's been taken over by extremist special interest groups such as the gay lobby and others ( much the same way the Republicans were taken over by the religious right in the 80 s ) . It's a political favor game now , not honest advocacy for the people as Jefferson would have had it . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Are you not doing the exact same thing ? Did you perhaps mean : " I would agree with " " making sure there is fairness " and " honest advocacy " , EXCEPT for gay people . ???<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No , that's why I support equal opportunity for people regardless of their sexual behavior . But I don't support redefining the marriage standard in this country , either . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>OH . So " marriage " is only for hetrosexual people who use sex ONLY for procreation ONLY in the Missionary position ?<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>126<br>Two subjects are discussing liberalism and its similarities or lack thereof to the Jeffersonian belief system.

S2 advises he supports equal opportunities for all people despite their sexual preferences; however, he does not support the redefinition of marriage to allow for gay unions.

Why do you feel your values are right and others that disagree as wrong ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Polygamy is not women married together . It's one man or women married to multiple of the opposite sex like a harem or entourage . Everyone feels their values are right or else they wouldn't believe in them . What we value shows .

Speaking of dependency , imagine a scenario where a gay person is in a same-sex marriage , that is not legally recognized . This person is also dependent on the other spouse . The marriage breaks up . Now , the taxpayer must support the dependent partner , because the marriage was not legally recognized . If it were legal , the richer partner could have been made to support the poorer one , after divorce . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Same sex marriage marriage partners that aren't legally mrried are called ROOMMATES .

We are not talking about singles , or roomates , when we talk of marriage . I don't see roomates sharing an apartment arguing for such a recognition or responsibility . As much as many trust and care for their roomates , it's not by that much . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No , we're not talking about marriage .

It won't be just for a heterosexual contract in Mass . in May . There are married heterosexual couples who either choose to not have children , or cannot have children . So it is not just for having a family unit with children either .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This isn't europe . There dirinking laws , prostituition laws , and many other laws are different than ours .

Hawaii did the same thing in 1997 and their legislature stopped it . I believe Mass will do the same . A family is the basic unit in society traditionally consisting of two parents rearing their own or adopted children ; also : any of various social units differing from but regarded as equivalent to the traditional family < a single-parent family > . We're talking about traditional families . A family can be just a wife and husband .

Single parenthood is not viewed as the moral traditional ideal among conservatives .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>They don't ask them about polygamy . Also gays rights is more political than anything else . It doesn't really matter does it . We'll see in the end who's right . Single parent is natural . Many husbands die early .

What    s this world coming too ? LOL <br><b>S1:2-  </b>King David having multiple wives was under Old Testament practice .

You didn    t state what you considered to be    numerous    nor did you supply anything to back up that statement . However deficits depend on both increased spending and lower revenues . Bush has done both with large tax cuts and large discretionary spending increases . And even the conservatives are beginning to criticize him for being a big spending president .

There are many aspects of HIS liberalism I would agree with : I like their focus on domestic social issues such as taking care of elderly , making sure there is fairness , freedom for black people , etc. But liberalism as embodied today by the Democratic party has become anti-religion , over-regulatory , and it's been taken over by extremist special interest groups such as the gay lobby and others ( much the same way the Republicans were taken over by the religious right in the 80 s ) .

It won't be just for a heterosexual contract in Mass . in May . There are married heterosexual couples who either choose to not have children , or cannot have children .

What is the reason it's not legally recognized ? Because the couple is gay . Where do you get the figure of 500,000 gay couples who want to immediately be married ? Would these gay couples beat the straight couples in some kind of a race to the weddings occurring at the same time , or occurring over the course of a month or a year ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>They're not legally recognized because they don't meet the legal criteria for marriage , ie one man , one woman . A cat doesn't meet the legal definition of a dog . Do we change the definition of dog to appease the cat ? That's the real question to be answered by society . Actually , I pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only , but after reading the CBO report , I see that I wasn't far off . They predicted 600,000 gay couples would want to get married it allowed .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This is circular reasoning however .

To me , and I'm guessing millions of others , the term gay marriage is an oxymoron . That's not to say that we shouldn't consider the possibility of allowing gay unions with , possibly , equivalent rights to hetero couples if we , as a society , see the benefit in doing so . For example , prior to FDR , the concept of state welfare was considered ludicrous and unconstitutional , but he was able to get enough support ( and enough political muscle ) to change society's mind on the role of the Federal gov't once he demonstrated the " good " that doing so had on America in its most dire time of need . People were willing to sacrifice a little freedom for security just as Ben Franklin had warned against .

S2 cites a Harris Interactive poll from 2003 showing that 62% of Americans did not think homosexual marriages should be recognized as legal. He claims that advocates of homosexual marriage are heterophobes trying to force homosexual marriage onto America. He claims that if people have the right to support homosexual marriage, then  other people have just as much right to oppose gay marriage due to the freedoms described in the US Constitution.<br><b> key:   </b>1-788_12_9__15_31_35_40_2 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>It would lead ultimately down the road to a marriage bill for polygamists .

What    s this world coming too ? LOL <br><b>S1:2-  </b>King David having multiple wives was under Old Testament practice . Jesus himself stated that divorce laws were granted by Moses and allowed by God because of the hardness of the people hearts . Jesus said a man shall leave his father and mother and be cleaved to his WIFE , Not WIVES . BTW , its called serial MONOGAMY .

The statement you referred to does indicate that he was talking about a single wife , but I wouldn    t base a whole social convention on one word out of a whole book . Anyway the Jews don    t believe in the New Testament . Would it be okay for them ? Man I screwed that one up . I    ll try to be a little more articulate in the future . :) Okay I was just wondering . I base my wing on what I think is correct , not left or right .

Numerous Democrats actually wanted to spend more than the Bush Administrations 12.5% increase in federal spending .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I was basing that on your previous statement In other words , anything that is opposed to one wing must be the opposite so I don    t see how it    s absurd unless you want to call your original statement absurd . This is obviously not the thread for this discussion but I will reply this time and see where it takes us . You didn    t state what you considered to be    numerous    nor did you supply anything to back up that statement . However deficits depend on both increased spending and lower revenues . Bush has done both with large tax cuts and large discretionary spending increases . And even the conservatives are beginning to criticize him for being a big spending president . Over the past 23 years ,    conservative    administrations have increased the deficits and    liberal    administrations have decreased the deficits . So yeah it looks to me like left wing is against deficits and right wing is for deficits .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>127<br>S1 claims that legalizing homosexual marriage would eventually lead to the legalization of polygamous marriage, citing a proposed constitutional amendment that bans both gay marriage and polygamy.

He claims that if people on the right wing support a ban on gay marriage, then the left wing must oppose a ban on gay marriage.
S2 cites instances of God supporting polygamy in the Bible. He claims that we already practice serial polygamy because of America's liberal divorce laws.

To me , and I'm guessing millions of others , the term gay marriage is an oxymoron . That's not to say that we shouldn't consider the possibility of allowing gay unions with , possibly , equivalent rights to hetero couples if we , as a society , see the benefit in doing so . For example , prior to FDR , the concept of state welfare was considered ludicrous and unconstitutional , but he was able to get enough support ( and enough political muscle ) to change society's mind on the role of the Federal gov't once he demonstrated the " good " that doing so had on America in its most dire time of need . People were willing to sacrifice a little freedom for security just as Ben Franklin had warned against .

He argues that if a public official had a religious objection to heterosexual marriages, then he would not expect that person to perform his marriage and would instead seek out someone who would. S2 believes it is inappropriate for public officials to be able to deny services based on their personal religious beliefs. If they are unable to do their job, he suggests, they should not be able to hold that position.<br><b> key:   </b>1-10354_4_3__5_12_13_14_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>DOMA isn't unconstitutional .

S2 questions the validity of using the term natural to define marriage. He uses an example of same-sex marriage in a Congo tribe to show that marriage is defined by the needs of the social group. Banning gay marriage is forcing one set of believes onto others.

Evangelical Christians have been opposed and do speak out against gay marriage. They go on to announce that a state constitutional amendment is being passed to preclude same sex marriage and civil unions. That means that same sex couples will be seen in the same light as straight couples. S1 defends the Christians by stating that they do not try to discriminate on gay marriages, and says that they aren't trying to ban gay marriage. the GUEST thinks it is laughable to think that they are that united in one particular event or fight together for good.

Agreed , when the spouse is part of a hetero relationship . Gay spouse is not a legally recognized category .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem . What is the reason it's not legally recognized ? Because the couple is gay . Where do you get the figure of 500,000 gay couples who want to immediately be married ? Would these gay couples beat the straight couples in some kind of a race to the weddings occurring at the same time , or occurring over the course of a month or a year ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>They're not legally recognized because they don't meet the legal criteria for marriage , ie one man , one woman . A cat doesn't meet the legal definition of a dog . Do we change the definition of dog to appease the cat ? That's the real question to be answered by society . Actually , I pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only , but after reading the CBO report , I see that I wasn't far off . They predicted 600,000 gay couples would want to get married it allowed .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This is circular reasoning however . It's stating that marriage simply is heterosexual , and so completely ends debate . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Exactly my point , just as a cat can never be considered a dog just because someone wants it to be . To me , and I'm guessing millions of others , the term gay marriage is an oxymoron . That's not to say that we shouldn't consider the possibility of allowing gay unions with , possibly , equivalent rights to hetero couples if we , as a society , see the benefit in doing so . For example , prior to FDR , the concept of state welfare was considered ludicrous and unconstitutional , but he was able to get enough support ( and enough political muscle ) to change society's mind on the role of the Federal gov't once he demonstrated the " good " that doing so had on America in its most dire time of need . People were willing to sacrifice a little freedom for security just as Ben Franklin had warned against . Now , I'll be the first to tell you that I think FDR was the biggest threat to American freedom that ever existed , but one can't argue his ability to change public opinion on the role of the Federal gov't .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It concerns reason , as Jaxian said earlier . What are the logical reasons for marriage discrimination against gays and lesbians ?<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>126<br>S1 agrees that when a husband is part of a heterosexual relationship a gay husband is not legally recognized in the same category. His statistics support the fact that 60,000 gay couples would get married if they were allowed. The equal rights aren't there when it comes to same sex marriage. Welfare is referenced when making a point about political muscle. American freedom never existed and no one can't argue that FDR's public opinion on the role on the federal government. S2 thinks that it is a problem because same sex marriage has never been legally recognizes is a big problem.  The debate is more for straight couples than it is about gay relationships.
