And you won't have to like it .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>None of us will have to like it , as it ain't gonna happen . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not only are you wrong , but you'll be dead wrong and won't be able to save yourself from the Pit .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Presumably you can provide unequivocal proof of this then . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You'll get your proof soon enough . You might even drop down into the Pit by morning , lest the mercy of the Lord keeps you for a later time .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Not going to happen . Nice to think that you are suggesting it might happen tonight , though . How jolly christian of you . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Darn right it's Christian of me . Who else is going to warn you to straighten up so you don't have to go to Hell , your Sodom and Gomorrah brethren ? Wise up .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Let's face it , you're just a bitter old coot who has nothing better to do than threaten people with baseless drivel . You don't frighten me . If you had the slightest bit of evidence , you would have presented it by now . You got nothing . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>< Flush > Listen , you stiff-necked heathen , if the Gospels were such a piece of rubbish that they look like a fairy tale to you , then it should be a piece of cake for you to bust the resurrection . But you can't . Not even with a lethal dose of Viagra can you muster up a decent argument . You never could . And until you do that you're in dire danger of dropping down into the Pit at any moment . Only the good graces of God continue to hold you up for a time . You're busted . And you'd better wise up while you can .<br><b> S2:5-  </b>That's it Easy , start with your usual ' flush ' , which we all know means you have no answer . Then get in with an insult , followed by an attempt to switch the burden of proof . And finish with a veiled threat . Your rhetoric truly is pathetic . <br><b>S1:6-  </b>What's pathetic is your lame-brain support for this kind of abomination : Obama , touting gay marriage stance , calls for repeal of Defense of Marriage Act Read more : http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012...#ixzz1utWOvU1C He's a spiritual imbecile , as are those who support his madness .<br><b> S2:6-  </b>No , what's pathetic is your tactic of dodging every argument . And the fact that you go to Fox for your news reinforces this . You claim that you have already passed over to the other side simply because you believe ( you have no evidence , but that has never stopped you ) . Then you provide several quotes from the bible that suggest that you need to do more than just believe , and actually have to do good deeds . When this is pointed out to you , you do a quick presto chango , avoid the debate , the insults start flying , and threats of eternal damnation abound . All this does is show that you have nothing other than a pathetic fairy tale based dillusion . You have no evidence , but haven't the guts to admit it . Unfortunately for you , you also don't have the brains to make a good debate of it . You just repeat the same old drivel , and revert to insults and threats - and your ' flush ' - when you have nothing intelligent to say ( which is just about every post ) . <br><b>S1:7-  </b>You've got nothing but your usual drivel , denials , whines , and unfounded conjecture . When you grow a pair of cojones and back it up with some credible arguments and credible scholarship that busts the resurrection of Christ , then you will have gained some credibility around here . Until then you're nothing more than a noisy little Christ denier .</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-9391_469_451__471_473_481_484_487_489_492_502_503_527_530_534_540_547_550_552_556_558_6<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I suppose . I'm not religious , so what Christians do is pretty meaningless to me . I would not claim anyone is harmed . But we all have to live in this society , so the official policies are our business . Your threat here is empty since heterosexual marriage is the status quo . You have to justify changes you wish to make to the status quo , but what currently is in place doesn't need justification .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Quote : Originally Posted by Matthew S View Post How are they harmed if two men they do not know sign a contract with the state . Are they going to be offended If I form a corporation ? It is none of their business , just as their marriages are none of my business . Yes they are forced to have to accept same sex marriages big f'n deal I am forced to accept their hetero marriages . They didn't ask my permission if they could get married so why should I have to ask their permission ? I think he makes a valid point . If something is popular or the norm that doesnt meant it should be accepted automatically . You still need a good reason to accept it . So why should we accept heterosexual marriages ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Heterosexual relationships are accepted because they are popular or the norm . The " should " or " ought-ness " doesn't change what " is " . Heterosexual relationships can be discussed purely on philosophical grounds , but in the context of gay marriage it's the wrong question . The question is not : why should we accept the status quo . The question is : why should we change it . To me , it is akin to asking : Why should we accept having separate bathrooms for men and women . The obvious answer is : Is there a good reason to change it ? I don't really have to justify having separate bathrooms , but I would have to justify changing the arrangement .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Just because something is popular or the norm doesnt mean it is ok . There have been many popular actions that were considered normal at the time but we now know they arnt ok . What makes heterosexual marriage ok ? We should allow same sex marriage because we as a country believe in equality for all people . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Oh I don't mean to suggest that the current state of affairs is moral or just . That's just how policy debates work . The challenger has the burden to justify their plan . What inequality currently exists ? A straight , unmarried individual has the same rights a gay , unmarried individual has . In your example , where there is a national ban upon goth shirts there is an identifiable right that is being violated , and it isn't the promise of equality but would instead treated as a restriction on individual liberty . Of course , that's if we put aside the question of whether it is in the Federal Gov'ts power to ban clothing in the first place ( it really isn't something the Federal Gov't can do , btw ) .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I still find it to be a good question . The inequality is in the gay persons inability to legally get married to the person he loves . And not being able to marry someone you love is a restriction on individual liberty . The federal government can do what we let them do . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Except marrying whom we love isn't a right in the first place , so there is nothing to restrict . Since we've pretty well established that , legally , it is a binding contract between two people , love is neither necessary nor required for it to take place . Only by long tradition has marriage been between two people who love one another but , then , marriage is a lot of things by tradition . Well , not constitutionally at least .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>According to the supreme court it is indeed a right . And while legally it is just a contract it isnt just a contract to the individuals who actually get married . It was meant for couples who love each other . It is set up to give benefits that are relevant to couples that love each other . Yeah marriage is a lot of things by tradition . Such as a means of keeping family ties strong by arranging marriages and such . Well the constitution doesnt seem to matter to the federal government anymore . After all the Patriot Act was a direct violation of the 4th amendment . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>The government has no way to enforce or defend having love within a marriage , nor would it be the role of government to do so ( the gov't cannot and should not tell me who I love ) . Love is not legally part of marriage for this reason , and we have no right to have it . There is no right that heterosexual people have that homosexual people do not , since the requirements of marriage are the same for us all . Those who are unmarried , gay or straight , have the same rights . This is why speaking about marriage in terms of rights isn't compelling to most people , I think . Among nobility and the ruling class , sure , and love was not usually part of the bargain . Even then the purpose was for the couple to have children that were the heir to both houses . Love was for the lucky while children were expected . We are a class-less society with restrictions on inheritance , though , so it would be difficult for arranged marriages to be usual even if we wanted to . A more overarching theme is two people who love each other marry and have a family ( meaning : have children ) . This is unfortunately true .<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Your right . The government wouldnt have a way to enforce or defend love within a marriage . I said marriage was set up for couples who love each other . Meaning that is who the government had in mind when they decided on what benefits to give to those who are married . And if we dont have the right to marry someone we love then why did the Supreme Court make the decision that they did with Loving vs. Virginia ? After all the interracial couple had the same rights as everyone else . They were allowed to marry someone as long as they were a member of their own race . The requirements of marriage was the same for them as it was everyone else . Marriage however is a right . The reason I mentioned marriage as a means of keeping family ties strong is to show marriage has changed throughout history . There really is no " traditional " marriage . And its time to allow same sex couples to get married . Children dont always have to be part of the equation . <br><b>S1:6-  </b>In actuality it was not equal when the races could not marry each other . For example , a black man did not have the right to marry the same women that a white man would have the right to marry . The rules were only superfically the same . Instead it created an inequality . The same thing could not be said between heterosexual and homosexual men . Certainly there are overarching themes relating to marriage . You've named at least one yourself . Marriage , as a custom , was intended for two people who love each other . I would add that marriage , as a custom , was intended to form the basis of a family with children . Neither intention is legally enforcable , of course , but it does color our perceptions .<br><b> S2:6-  </b>And the rules arnt only superficially the same now with same sex marriage ? However I still maintain that they are similar . After all they were banning people from marrying outside of their race . It is true that they werent allowed to marry the exact same people but then again neither are men and women . A man can marry a woman but a woman cannot marry a woman . And a woman can marry a man but a man cant marry a man . So it is still the same thing . Yes it is possible that marriage could have been used back in the day to form the basis of a family with children but whats to stop gay people from raising a child ? And marriage has changed throughout the years and that is not the reason to get married anymore . Love is the reason nowadays we get married . Edit : For some reason when I go to my User CP and click on the thread that has new posts it takes me a couple posts into the new posts so sorry if I have missed any of your posts that were responding to me . <br><b>S1:7-  </b>The case could be made but I'm not sure you'd gain any ground . It is not a gay-rights issue then , but a gender rights issue . The comparison was solely meant to cover homosexual rights versus heterosexual rights . Marriage has changed but not so much the perception of it . Certainly nothing stops a homosexual couple from adopting ( aside from local law ) , but they can never naturally produce a child . Only a heterosexual couple can do that . Since the perception of marriage is a couple in love that forms the basis of a family that they create between them , even adoption would not include a homosexual couple into that vision . I'm not sure anything could . No worries<br><b> S2:7-  </b>So are you agreeing that the ban on same sex couples is like the ban on interracial couples getting married ? But yes that would still be a gay rights issue and is a great argument for same sex marriage being legalized . So I must ask you why exactly are you against same sex marriage when it has been shown that the ban on same sex marriage is just like the ban on interracial couples getting married ? The perception of marriage certainly has changed . As I have pointed out socially it used to be used to keep family ties strong and had nothing to do with love . Nowadays it has everything to do with love . There are sterile couples that are married and could never naturally produce a child . So we dont allow marriage based on the ability to create children . But really the only thing we have to know on the issue of same sex marriage is the Supreme Court believes marriage is a right and right now gay couples do not have that right . <br><b>S1:8-  </b>No , like I said the case could be made for gender rights but not gay rights . Remember our variable ? If the question is the rights of homosexuals versus heterosexual then the variable is sexual orientation , not gender . If that's the variable then my argument stands . Heterosexuals have the same rights that homosexuals have and it would not be similar to racial barriers . Like I said , that was only true among nobles and ruling classes . It was a peculiarity forced upon them by their position , not how the ' purpose ' was viewed . What do you think all the stories of " oh I need to marry the prince but I love the stableboy " stories are all about ? It would be similar , today , of marrying someone for the benefits . The overarching theme is and was as a custom for two people who love each other and " seeing your children in their eyes " , as the song goes . I'm not talking about legal requirements . You don't have to love whom you marry or have children with whom you marry . You don't have to live with them or , indeed , have anything to do with them after you marry . It's a contract , remember ? Homosexuals already have the right to marry . They have every right that heterosexuals do .<br><b> S2:8-  </b>So you still dont think the ban on same sex marriage is just like the ban on interracial marriage ? How so ? But if you want to change the variable to gender inequality then fine by me . The genders are not equal due to the same sex marriage ban . Yes it was only between the higher classes ... much like many things in society back then . Ok so if you dont have to have the ability to have children to get married then why are you using that as an argument against same sex marriage ? Homosexuals do NOT have the right to marry who they love . Much like in the case of Loving vs. Virginia . Would you say that back in the day that interracial couples had the same exact rights to get married as non interracial couples ? What is your reason to not allow same sex marriage . What harm would it do ? <br><b>S1:9-  </b>Then fight for gender equality and not gay rights . You'd have a much better case because gay people are not denied any rights . I'm not arguing against homosexual marriage . I'm countering the argument that homosexuals are denied rights . Marrying whom you love isn't a right . Loving whom you marry isn't a right . If the variable was race , then black men could not marry the same women that white men could marry . That isn't equal . In this case if the variable is sexual orientation then homosexuals can marry the exact same people heterosexuals can . The gay rights issue is dissimilar to the race issue .<br><b> S2:9-  </b>Fine . Same sex marriage should be legal because without it the genders are unequal . Now do you agree same sex marriage should be legalized ? Although since the Supreme court has decided that marriage is indeed a basic civil right and they also decided that the 14th amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by racial discrimination and since I showed that not allowing gay people to marry a member of the same sex is indeed the same thing as not allowing interracial couples to marry then I would still have to say gay people do not have the equal right to marry . Ok then . Why are you using that as a counter argument that homosexuals are denied rights ? Choosing who you marry is however a right . Now about the fourth line on the variable being race . Lets pretend that interracial couples still arnt allowed to get married . Who exactly would you say is being denied their rights ? Non interracial couples or interracial couples or both ? <br><b>S1:10-  </b>You concede , then , that homosexuals have the same rights heterosexuals do ? And I have shown that the situation of race is dissimilar to the situation of sexual orientation . That court case does not help you . Because homosexuals are not denied rights . If someone came here and said that the Earth is flat I would counter that argument as well . It simply is not true . Though the view that heterosexual attraction is more valid or has a " purpose " that homosexual attraction lacks has merit as well . Not really . You cannot marry someone who is already married , an animal , a minor or a sibling . Or someone of the same gender . Or a video game character . Or an inanimate object . Even if you love them . You have to follow the rules to get the benefits . Even if homosexuals can marry it will never be " you can marry whomever you want " . I'm honestly not sure how standing works in the court system . I could only say that white people could not marry the same people that black people could marry . If the variable is sexual orientation , then homosexual people can marry the same people that heterosexuals can . The situations are then dissimilar .<br><b> S2:10-  </b>Not entirely . Now can you answer my question ? How have you shown it is different ? I would still have to say we are still treated unequally . It depends on what you mean by purpose . And then the idea that since gay people cant reproduce they shouldnt be allowed to marry has already been disproven due to the fact that sterile couples still are allowed to marry . Let me change my statement then . It is a right to choose who you marry unless the person you want to marry cant give consent . Im sorry but that doesnt answer my question . Which group was being denied their rights . Interracial couples , non interracial couples , or both . Edit : About the you have to follow the rules to get the benefits thing . Back in the day the rule was you couldnt marry someone outside your race . However that is obviously unfair . That argument has no merit .</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-9391_518_516__520_523_526_531_539_8<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I'm saying that the limit to opposite sexes is one limit among others . If you don't follow the rules you don't qualify for the benefits . The fact that thereare rules does not mean anyone is barred from the custom .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And those rules used to include race as a qualifier for marriage . Neither blacks nor whites were allowed to marry outside of their race . Rights were applied equally based upon the confines of this criteria . If whom you wanted to marry fell outside of this criteria you were not allowed to wed . This is the same principal you are using to show equal rights amongst hetero and homo sexual people . The only difference is that as it stands now race has been removed from the criteria as it was viewed to be inappropriate and discriminatory . The gay marriage proponents are now advocating that gender be removed from the same criteria as it is also inappropriate and discriminatory . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Except they were demonstratably unequal . A black person could not marry those that a white person could marry , and white people were barred from marriage to those that black people were not barred from . Currently , there is no barrier that homosexual people have that heterosexual people do not share . The two situations are dissimilar . As long as there are any rules , this will be true . No-one may marry someone already married , an animal , a minor , or a sibling . There is nothing wrong with trying to change the status quo , but you don't have a right to the changes you want . They are just changes you want .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Yes , the qualifying criteria for marriage at the time was unequal which is why race was removed from criteria . But anyone who wanted to get married had to meet this criteria which was applied to everyone . This is the same argument that you are using to prove that there is no inequality between hetrosexuals and homosexuals . Yes , there is . A heterosexual couple can get married . A homosexual couple cannot . Your objection is a semantic one . Admittedly , no one has the right to marriage . But again I will reiterate . That is not the issue . The issue is homosexual couples cannot get married while heterosexual couples can . In so doing the government recognizes the heterosexual couple as significant members of the same family and award that couple benefits which include the ability to visit one another in a hospital , the ability to make impotortant life decisions if one of the members should become incompasitated , the ability to cover one another under their insurance , the ability to file taxes jointly , the ability to purchase property together and survivorship rights of said property , inheritance rights , and many others . These priveleges are being denied to homosexual couples . Not people , couples . They are being denied the above privelges not because the don't deserve them but because some people don't like the idea of them having sex . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not the criteria . The effect . Except that neither the qualifying criteria nor the effect is unequal between heterosexual and homosexual individuals . True , but couples do not have rights , individuals do . Agreed . I think it's more complicated than that , but that is essentially so . Heterosexual relationships are perceived as somehow more valid or as having a purpose that homosexual relationships lack . This is true ( if " purpose " is the right word ) on an evolutionary level , so the view has some validity . Of course , that should have no automatic policy implications but it would explain some of the resistance to the idea .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Agreed . Rights may not be the correct word . But there are benefits that heterosexual couples can obtain and homosexual couples cannot . Agreed . The bolded part of your post is the basis of gay marriage proponents . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The problem is that acquiring these marriage benefits depends on how people view that type of relationship . The biological or evolutionary " purpose " might not have automatic policy implications but they are made real by the people who vote on the issue . I'm not sure how to overcome this obstacle .</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-9391_370_363_1_371_372_373_374_376_377_378_384_385_389_390_391_392_394_395_11<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Its nothing like racial segregation ....<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It's everything like racial segregation and every kind of segregation throughout the course of history .

What did I actually contend was nothing like segregation not what you thought I did . You jumped in with your silly little rant without actually knowing the point I made .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Then you should've said " It's nothing like segregation " .

You're caught , and now just making it up as you go along . You originally said , ask any gay man and he will seem to know . I've never come across that at a rest area .

Some straight men would brag about scoring with a sexy woman in a public place but not getting caught . You're trying to change the subject , Larry Craig , er ... JP Sartre . Anyway , I'm not the one in the closet that's for sure . Here's what you originally said : http://www.4forums.com/political/gay...rdered-10.html So I'm expected to actually believe that you , JP , Mr. Anti-Gay Conservative are having this type of intimate relationship with gay men , who feel comfortable opening up like this with someone like you . JP is of course , merely curious in seeking that information as to where the glory holes can be found . Just as Pastor Ted Haggard claimed he never intended to use the meth he sought out . There's only one reason JP would be in this fruit loop . He knows gay people alright , extremely well . Oh defensively mock away at gay men . You just prove my point above . Maybe the lesser of two evils ? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I don't see any lack of moral character in people exercising their Constitutional Rights to deny the sanctity of marriage to immoral associations by not allowing the definition of marriage to be bastardized . I've been married , faithfully , for over 31 years . What's the longest exclusive relationship you're had , a month . I guess you missed the term " a high % of heterosexual males " in my statement . And you assumed that my knowledge of glory holes came from chatting with gays as opposed to firsthand observations and other means . No , I didn't mock " gay men " , I mocked you . :p [ / quote ] Maybe the lesser of two evils ? [ / QUOTE ] What could be more evil than a murdering drunk ?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I don't either . But that's not what happened . It was denied to loving , comitted gay couples . Yes , it was with one of your special closeted " friends " who was away from his wife of many years . He was always really horny and frustrated , looking for sheer Below again , is how you said you came by such knowledge in response to Matthew's query , you said you knew gay people . And before that you said ask any gay male and he'll tell you all about it . I'm right to assume you asked or talked to gay males about it in painstaking detail . This is obviously the crowd you hang out with . These are gay men who are very liberal in their sexual practices , maybe closeted , just looking to get their rocks off , and you're obviously right in the loop . I don't know why such an anti-gay , morally upstanding , righteous anti-gay Republican conservative such as yourself would have any interest in associating with such a scene . What would your wife think ? This is just a guess , she doesn't know ? You assumed I'd want to wear pink tights because I'm gay .

He says they don't hate us as individuals , just everything we represent as being wrong , unnatural etc. That boils down to the same thing ! Gansao condescends to us by calling us spoiled children because the majority group with power won't " let us have " , what they have .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Its not hate . It is drawing a line where pandering to sexual deviants stop . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>They said the same garbage during debate on inter-racial marriage . They tried to say those relationships were only about naughty sex . It was just bigotry , and it is in the case of same-sex marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Inter racial couples do not practise deviant sex . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Neither do gay people . You have failed to show that . Most people do not care what gay people do sexually . At any rate , you don't have a problem with gay persons having sex , I believe you said . Why does it suddenly make a difference because it's happening in a marriage ? Why should the official recognition of gay relationships affect you ? It's your own insecurity coming to light .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>We should be tolerant of gay deviant sex . We shouldnt welcome it . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Because it just might look TOO GOOD to yourself and / or others ?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Yeah yeah . When the gay paints himself in a corner he throws out the same old <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I don't know what else you are afraid of , other than more social acceptance would make it look more appealing . Nothing else makes sense . If gay sex doesn't affect you , how does a marriage contract ?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Gay positive discrimination and promotion of gay sex to minors are a concern . I do not want gay deviant sex to be considered anything other than that , deviant .. either <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Yes , ending marriage discrimination for gay couples , would end that discrimination . Gay marriage doesn't say anything about gay sex to minors . You've already said that sex should be tolerated . Thus , minors will learn to be tolerant of it . No sex education is about " promoting " sex . It's something people are likely to do , if they are gay or straight , and they need accurate , unbiased , age-appropriate information .<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Gay marriage would be the next step to positive discrimination for gays .. more gays as school governors , more gay politicians , more gay outreach to young confused gay teenagers . Teaching gay sex in school sex education lessons . To you this may be a mouth watering prospect but for most people it would be a kind of public grooming to accept gay deviant sex . The pedophiles and incestuous will follow using the same lies as you . <br><b>S1:7-  </b>You need to explain this term " positive discrimination " . I haven't heard it before . Are you claiming , gays will discriminate against straights for positions ? I don't see how gay marriage would facilitate this . Again , it's this level of acceptance nonsense you are worried about . That's your own insecurity talking . Social acceptance is happening , some of it may lead to marriage , more may come as a result of marriage . So what ? It's not going to make straight people gay . Secure straight people who support gay rights , recognize that . I haven't posted one lie here . There are other arguments for not accepting peds and incestuous , that are not simply the circular variety that acceptance will lead to further acceptance , which you use against gays .<br><b> S2:7-  </b>Google it . Gay marriage is a step towards it My own security ? What are you talking about ? The less perverted sex is accepted as the norm the better . There are many arguments against all types of sexual perversions <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Well that settles it . It can be found online , so it must be true . Heterosexuals discriminate against gays . It proves nothing about the right to marriage . You've failed to show why it should be an issue for anyone except the parties involved , or for gay people . You haven't shown how marriage specifically leads to more acceptance of gay sex . You haven't shown how the latter is a bad thing , except by using bigoted rhetoric ( it IS bad , it's perverted , it's deviant , it's wrong ) , not supported by logic . Show how gay sex in marriage is a perversion . Outside of marriage , you say it should be " tolerated " . Does that go for pedophilia and incest as well ? You're taking us on the diversion fallacy merry-go-round .<br><b> S2:8-  </b>You can find the DEFINITION if you Google A future comment of an apologist of father / daughter sex .. a lie is a lie You've failed to show why it should be an issue for anyone except the parties involved , or for incestuous people . You haven't shown how marriage specifically leads to more acceptance of incestuous sex . You haven't shown how the latter is a bad thing , except by using bigoted rhetoric ( it IS bad , it's perverted , it's deviant , it's wrong ) , not supported by logic Perhaps you are right . Maybe it should never had been tolerated at all . Then we would not be here today arguing for and against the marriage of perverts . <br><b>S1:9-  </b>Yeah , I'll get right on investigating that alleged gay conspiracy theory , after I look into the Jewish one . Nope . I haven't apologized for anything , nor have I lied . I'm asking you to explain your logic with respect to the subject at hand , which you avoid , except to repeat the same unsupported circular fallacies ( it's bad because you say it's bad ) , and diversions which you cannot show are linked to the issue at all . Sorting through the static of logical diversions is sometimes a chore , but it's not an apology , nor a lie . There move the goalposts . Society had come to this point , and will progress further on this issue , by using our intelligence as we always have . We will continue to move beyond ignorance and bigotry and fear .<br><b> S2:9-  </b>Its not a theory the very argument you put could be equally be put forward for other forms of perversion Given only two choices .. allow gays to marry or make homosexuality illegal We should make homosexuality illegal <br><b>S1:10-  </b>Yes it is , and a crackpot one at that . You're making this claim . The onus is on you to provide evidence and logic , proof , to support it . How likely is the latter to happen ?<br><b> S2:10-  </b>Gays like you prove it I have but you , unsurprisingly , refuse to accept it All the more reason for not allowing sexual perverts to marry <br><b>S1:11-  </b>Yet another unsubstantiated assertion . No . See above . You're using bigotry to support bigotry .<br><b> S2:11-  </b>It has been quite well substantiated by you and your gay friends Yes , see above Calling sexual perverts sexual perverts is not bigotry <br><b>S1:12-  </b>Like foundit said , objecting to a group discriminating against another group , does not mean you support discrimination against the group discriminating . That's messed up , and muddled like all your other thinking . Childish . It is when there is absolutely no reason for it that even apporaches anything logical .<br><b> S2:12-  </b>Just as I suspected . You do not have a feasible argument <br><b>S1:13-  </b>YOU are making the claim you dolt . The ONUS is on the person making the claim to prove it .</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-2280_102_99__104_113_117_118_120_121_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Although Jim and MrWrite's debate has devolved into an unfortunate battle of screw you's , the comparison of the arguments against interacial marriage and those against gay marriage has some merit . At least that's what this article suggests : Opponents of gay marriage use many of the same arguments as foes of interracial relationships did before Loving v . Virginia outlawed state bans on interracial marriage in 1967 , said law professor Kim Forde-Mazrui at a talk sponsored by the Center for the Study of Race and Law and Lambda Law Alliance Sept . 30 . http://www.law.virginia.edu/home2002...fall/forde.htm<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This is not relevant to my argument at all . I have mentioned nothing about religious beliefs or bible-thumping protests against homosexuality . I did not bring interacial marriage into the discussion because it does not apply . I'm not against interacial marriage as long as there's a man and a woman involved . I did not bring the silly argument about water fountains into the discussion . Separate-but-equal does apply in the sense that records of legally recognized couples would separate married couples from same-sex couples but would not justify any inequalities regarding their rights and privileges . Hospital visitation , inheritance and other things could be afforded both . I'm wondering if those who insist on same-sex couples being called " married " are not acting somewhat from self-imposed shame ... like you want to hide the fact that you are gay . My argument has thusfar been limited to the requirement to redefine several other words if we redefine " marriage " . It has nothing to do with homophobia which , by the way , I do not suffer from . I have some friends that are gay and they know how I feel about the word " marriage " . We remain friends . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I accept your argument at face value , although I will say that I believe that the majority of people who argue against gay marriage do so for religious or homophobe reasons . ( Again , I'm not saying you fall into these categories . ) Words get redefined all the time , and some of them are just as important as the word ' marriage ' . For example , the Iraq War is not technically a war -- congress never declared war . And this isn't just a semantic detail , either . Declaring war used to mean that congress committed , the president committed , and all the citizens made sacrifices for the cause . Now we initiate military operations , never declare war in order to allow political wiggle room , cut everyone's taxes , tell them to go shopping , and call it a war anyway . Now that's redefining a word . Substituting a Jack for a Jill on a marriage license seems pretty minor in comparison to me .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The invasion of Iraq was a resumption of warfare that ended in a cease fire . It was not technically a new war requiring all the congressional steps . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not to derail this thread -- we can talk about this more in the Politics section -- but the last time the US Congress declared war was for WWII . So the conflict in Iraq is not in fact a resumption of a prior declared war .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're technically correct . However , the Gulf War was approved by Congress whether it was a declared war or not . The Iraq War was a continuation of the same conflict after a cease fire . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I understand the Bush administration has made this argument , but I don't think it has a whole lot of merit . It was a different presidential administration and the reasons for the conflict were different -- to repel the invasion of Kuwait . Not to mention that the same logical argument could be used to begin a fresh invasion of Vietnam or Korea .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I think not . Those conflicts ended in something other than a cease fire .</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-5811_33_29__35_38_40_41_43_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Don't you think that in 1909 it was probably viewed mostly from a moral standpoint ? I don't think they saw it the same way they would see black people . They didn't even realize that ' homosexuality ' was any sort of innate thing . It was entirely behavioral to them . I tend to agree with the court , even given what you've said . I doubt for 1909 it was about prejudice and bigotry -- they genuinely felt it was wrong . The concept of gay marriage was completely foreign and unknown in 1909 . It wasn't even something they conceived of . I think the court is saying that they couldn't have been prejudiced against something they didn't even know of or conceive of .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Hogwash . It was once entirely moral to believe certain races were inferior , and that women had fewer rights than men . Treating the races and women as equal was not something even thought of by many . It was prejudice against gays then , and it still is today . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>This is not really true . It's a popular misconstruing of morality and history by proponents of modern ' rights ' movements , but it's not true . There's little historical backing to the idea that people believed oppressing black people was a right thing to do , as in , doing good . There were times they used an argument where religion was wrongly used to justify their behavior , but that's a different matter . If you firmly believe otherwise , I'd challenge you to show where people thought oppressing blacks was an example if doing good . The same goes for misogyny . Furthermore , it's beside the point anyway . We're talking about homosexuality . In 1909 , the only thing they really understood about the issue at hand was that some people engaged in sexual relations with people of their own gender . There were no articles about " homosexuality " as a trait , and certainly none about genetic causes . It was understood entirely from a behavioral standpoint , and therefore a moral standpoint . So it's not hogwash at all -- they really did view gay sex as immoral . If you don't think so , then you have a very poor grasp on history in this case .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This kind of morality is based on nothing but ignorance ( which you admit ) and prejudice . What kind of a basis is that for a so-called moral code ? So what if it involves behaviour ? Gay people have sex , develop relationships , and bond , just like everyone else , but in a way that reflects their gay sexuality . This does not mean people could not be prejudiced about the way gay people live . People were , and are so prejudiced . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>A better reverse analogy would have been to say " So then conversly I have the right to advocate that heterosexual relations are morally wrong " . Not heterosexuality , since it's not homosexuality ( as it's a state of being ) that religious people have a problem with . Heck , they often don't even recognize it . With that caveat , yes you are certainly free to advocate whatever you want to be morally wrong . ( And unlike the way some in your movement do , I won't call you a " bigot " for doing so ! ) It may have been based on " ignorance " , but I reject the notion it was based on prejudice ( and therefore I tend to agree with the 6 - 0 view of the justices here ) . The 1909 society had too little understanding of gay people to be prejudiced over in the first place . Remember , homosexuality was not understood as a state of being at that time . The term itself had not been around long and was not known to most people . And even to those it was known to , it was not known as a state of being . And there certainly was no social identity among gay people as a group -- how could prejudice have existed if there was nothing ( from their perspective ) to be prejudiced toward ?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Right . Provided gays don't live gay , but live straight , gays can be as gay as they want . As long as gays don't outwardly show what makes them different from straights , gays can be as gay as they want . It's bs . Also some may not recognize the existence of gay people or their gay lives , but that is putting one's head in the sand . Nonsense . People would widely and hatefully use the term " sodomite " to refer to gays . Before that the term was " molly " . Clearly there was an identity they were prejudiced towards . They were rounding up gays in areas they were known to attend , and putting them in prison . Read up on the trial of Oscar Wilde . Gays may have been forced underground , to a greater extent , but that does not mean they were not thought of . Gays were just not thought of in a nice way . Gays were purposely kept out of everything in society , when society didn't really think of gays as human too . That isn't prejudice ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Because they didn't approve of sodomy ! Do you not agree they didn't understand the concept of homosexuality ??? There was no social identity . When they were put on trial , it wasn't because they were gay ( which they had no concept of ) , it was because they had gay relations which society viewed as wrong ! No , here's where you don't get it -- it's not that " gays " ( there was no concept of that ) were purposely kept out of of everything , it's that people who had sodomy relationships were kept out of everything , because sodomy was viewed as wrong . They really did think it was wrong ! You are so determined to portray everything that has anything to do with gay relations possibly being wrong as prejudice and bigotry that you are close-minded about it .</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-2844_72_71__73_74_75_81_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The Republicans are pushing the " hot-button " issues by appealing to people's ignorance and prejudice , in order to distract them from the important bread and butter issues that directly affect EVERYONE on a daily basis .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Oh , I don't know . Social Security , high taxes , poor schools , terrorism , I'd say these are bread and butter issues to many . Unlike Democrats with their abortion , AA , gay marriage , global warming , yada , yada , yada , BS . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Oh , I'm sorry . Who is it that wants to ban gay rights with a Constitutional Amendment , thus making an issue of it ? Who wants to take the decision to abort away from a woman and her doctor , by banning some rare types of abortions , thus making an issue ? Global warming is an important issue that has the potential to affect everyone . Democrats are conserned about all the issues you have raised . The Democrats certainly did a better job fiscally , keeping the books ballanced , when they were in power . But Republicans care about giving their rich elite friends tax breaks , no matter what the cost . They divide everyone else with fear , ignorance and irrational prejudice . Issues of personal morality divide and distract from seeing what truely affects everyone . It's no place for the government or for a peeping tom God ( unless you personally believe in that God ) . Gay marriage doesn't have an affect anyone's life unless they want it . Abortion doesn't have an affect anyone's life , unless they want one .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>One could argue that if the Left wasn't pushing a radical agenda , no action on the part of the Right would have been necessary . Instead , the Left got some activist judges and politicians to manipulate the system , forcing the need for a mid-stream correction . It's BS , pure and simple . Now , THERE'S some revisionist history . It was a Republican Congress that first balanced the budget after gaining control of the HR for the first time in 40 years . Unfortunately , the legacy costs imposed by the Democratic social engineering make it so the budget will probably never be balanced again . Ah , right out of the liberal handbook . Get some originality , please . You can't cut taxes for people who DON'T pay them , duh ! Sure , it's the Republicans telling Seniors and children that the bad Republicans want to starve them , right ? It's not the likes of Ted Kennedy , Howard Dean , Jesse Jackson , and John Kerry scaring them . ;) I've told you before , I don't care what consenting adults do , just don't **** with marriage . Period . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I don't see how the system was being manipulated . Judges were interpreting a constitution . That's what they do . A legislature can pass a law , but whether or not it's in line with rights guaranteed in a constitution , is another matter . Some of the right-wing are so worried another group of people will get their due constitutional rights , they want to change the constitution to prevent it . Will they do this for other groups who want equal rights ? It's certainly up for debate which side is being more manipulative . You want to impose your personal and religious morality on everyone else , by giving those who don't share your beliefs , fewer rights .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The manipulation came when gays married in Mass attempted to use the " Full Faith and Credit Clause as a means to force the acceptance of gay marriage on te rest of the contry . The Full Faith and Credit Clause was never intended , nor does it apply to marriage laws . The FFaCC holds for court judgements , but not licenses . It's no different that having a driver's license in MI at age 16 , but not being allowed to drive in NY until you're 18 , even if you hold a valid MI driver's license . There are dozens of such precedents for not acknowledging licenses issued in other states . The 10th Amendment says that those rights not specifically given to the Feds belong to the State or individuals . In many states , the people have decided whether or not gay marriage should be allowed and have exercised their 10th Amendment right to self-govern . Now , you can argue all you want about the net effect of that self-governing , but it is entirely constitutional .</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10824_2_1__4_5_7_8_10_13_17_19_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>A very well put editorial that asks and question I have wondered a number of times myself , and have brought up before . On Gay Marriage , Media Gives Obama a Pass - Yahoo ! News<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Here is the difference Every Republican presidential candidate wants gay marriage banned and gay people thrown into prison through the reinstatement of sodomy laws . They are very loud and clear on this point . They would put their personal opinions in to law that subjugate gay people . President Obama has said that he believes that marriage is between a man and a woman but he is not willing to put his personal beliefs into law . He has done everything he can to support the marriage equality position . He has said that he favors a system of strong civil unions . Besides if Obama wins reelection then he will come out for full marriage equality . No other president in US history has done more for the gay community the president Obama . He has been our strong advocate in the white house . The problem for you is that you fall on the side of imposing your moral views upon others and can not understand why someone would not want to . They don't give him a pass here is a quote from a press conference . http://www.queerty.com/obama-of-cour...mies-20110629/ <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Oh good grief . Fear-monger much ? Matthew you really need to give up the gay-pride politics blogs and embrace reality for a change .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I hear the sound of the marching of the boots of the brown shirts every time I here any of the Republican candidates speak , even your precious Ron Paul . The Republican candidates all support the re-institution of sodomy laws . Rick Perry even supports the proposed Uganda law , his religion is supporting , that would not only imprison gays but execute them . But once again to the OP Obama is not given a pass on marriage equality it is just that he will never do anything to stop it and will help marriage equality become a reality . The republican candidates all will do everything in their power to stop marriage equality . Here is the pledge they signed http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2011/1...dge/?mobile=nc http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2011/0...rriage-pledge/ <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Nobody is going to imprison or execute gays here in the U.S. Give it a rest . You're in far greater danger in this country simply from economic collapse by staying with Obama than you are any danger of the paranoid delusions you come up with over the gay issue .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Hummm I wonder if you would have said the same thing to the native Americans or the Japanese Americans . It has happened before and can happen again . Do I need to remind you of the hundreds of thousands of native Americans that are dead at the hands of the US military or that the Japanese Americans dragged from their homes and locked away in concentration camps . An don't get me started on institution of slavery that was written into the constitution and lasted for over 80 years under that constitution . Yes these things happened here in the US and if they can happen once who knows what will happen to us . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The point is that they haven't happened since then . Don't worry Matthew , the police aren't blocking the door to your meat markets or favorite hook-up spot . You're free to have all the gay sex you want .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>My point is that if these things have happened once , under the same Constitution we currently have , then they can happen again . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>So what would you do , put a gay-protection amendment in the constitution ?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>In a way .

' is hardly proof , that is beyond coincidence predicting that ' things will stay much the same as they are and natural events will occur as usual ' . Abortions an unwed couples seems to have pretty much nothing to do with the last line . As for minorities and the constitution , the majority can change the constitution or just ignore it . It is in the majorities interest to support and accept minorities because pretty much everyone falls within one of them and minorites still have a significant number of people , maybe not the most important but enough to swing power between forces competting over the majority .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The number of earthquales that have happened outside of Israel in the last 100 yrs is exponentially increased . Believe what you will . If you have a better understanding of love waxing cold I'd like to hear it . Obviously we don't have the smae understanding of the US government . Teh majority rules unless it violates the constitution . If you can point out how that isn't true then I'd be interested in being enlightened . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Unless you are a beleiver in a religion , then the whole Earthquake thing is irrelevant and if you are then this isn't the debate for you . I haven't been argued that homosexuality is right according to religious beleifs , but more often that your religious beleifs should have nothing to do with my life . Acceptance of homosexuality effecting plate tectonics ? Time to come back to the real world , even if it is true , why should you worship a being that is quite happy to destroy homes and kill people for becoming more tolerant but is quite happy with the famine and AIDS situation and doesn't get involved with politics ? The constitution is not magic , it has been changed because enough people wanted it done , if the majority wants to ignore or change a part of the consititution it will do .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>First opff Jake started this rel ; igious topic . Reread the posts I'm only refuting his assertions . I did not say homosexuality is the cause of anything religious only citing support against Jake's comments . Don't ever try to assume you know God's mentality . Most parents love their children but they raise them according to how they feel is best . According tro what they know . Why are some parents motivator and others discipliners ? That's my popint if the majority want it they will do it . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And I refute your refutations . You implied that the Earthquakes were not a natural thing and dinviinly caused Even if there is a god , any ' loving parent ' that kills some of its children to make a point , when they are fully capable of just changing the issue anyway is hardly deserving of worship . As for people changing , not only is that dubious anyway but not really proof of anything , there are alcoholics who recover and don't drink and that is definitely genetically influenced . You clearly have no real idea about the state of genetic research or how it works , we are nowhere near finding the purpose of everything . There doesn't appear to be one gene , but there is probably a combination that lead to a greater chance of being gay . @ Rev , Power of Attorney would be fine , but giving that there is already favouritism shown to some people , why should that favouritism be arteficailly restricted . In the interest of fairness it seems a lot easy to recognise a few more people in an existing group that abolishing it . Also not everyone shares your view on the purpose and role of a government<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No you refute your inferences No I didn't Who said God killed them ? For someoen that claims there is no God it's amazing how you're the expert now on the nature of God . i agree there is a disposition but that doesn't mean that they are genetically confined as the alcoholic isn't . So why draw the line at homosexuals ? Why not polygamists ? Why do homosexuals deserve the right and polygamists don't ? What merits do homosexuality bring that polygamy doesn't ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So that little peice of geological trivia was just that , and had nothing to do with this debate or any points whatsoever ? Perhaps some people are capable of thinking from another's point of view , if God is a loving parent I can't see how you can justify the view that anything lethal can be used as a punishment . I don't think you know how genetics works in this instance . Or do you think that the method of upbringing they have is purely responisble ? I don't really see any real problem with polygamy itself , but it would have to be watched a little more carefully perhaps as the cultures that practise polygamy tend to be less focused on equality between sexs . As long as you make sure that the marriages are still volentary for both partners and that any person is fully able to leave if they want to then I can't really see the problem . However it is a lot more complicated if you are looking from the benefits point of view with respect to inheritance and other aspects ( child support and suchlike ) but these are realitively minor points that would just have to be worked out if this type of marriage was to be recognised</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-1281_206_203__227_238_259_278_467_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You're late . I didn't bring up religon in my argument . Jake did . So please don't specualte anything until you knwo what we're talking about . All laws are based upon morals . So it is based upon the morals of the country whcih happen to be predominantly Christian . England was one of many countries . There is no new family structure that didn't exist before this country . My definition of negative effect is that the puposes for which something is created is hindered or compromises . By changing standards there is a harm to it's integrity . Intregrity is compromised when it isn't stable . Soemthing that changes all teh time loses that integrity like John Kerry on his views . Things must remain consistent to be integral . This argument has a flaw . That when there is guaranteed religous freedomw then we dont ' have equal rights . Everyone has equal rights in terms of believing . However behavior is regualted by the government . Therefore we can do anyting in the name of religion until it violates behavior that is acceptable by society .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Fine , so what if the government said people are free to ' believe ' in God , but any sign of them putting their belief into practice , such as going to church or even just praying in private was illegal ? Would that be acceptable ? After all it is just regulating behaviourA , not belief ? Your comparisons are ludicrous . All of these situations involve non-consensual acts either through lack of knowledge or involvement of minors . You cannot compare that to consensual acts between adults . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That probably wouldn't be acceptable to most people but it would be legal and equal . They don't allow religious practices of polygamy , animal or human sacrifices , body mutilation , and many other religious practices . So then we should allow prostitution , polygamy , human trafficking , drug trafficking , gambling , drug distribution , and all other consensual acts .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But they obviously wouldn't be equal , because a significant proportion of the population would be restricted from worshipping how they want in a for that hurts nobody . These elements mostly have links to crime over and above the act itself , that justifies restrictions . Homosexuality doesn't . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The poeple would be equal . The religions would not . Look at our country . Almost all Christian beleifs are legal and no other non-Christians Churches have almost all their legal beleifs . That's it ? Crime ? That's it . The criminal link ? So if they criminalized homosexuality then it would be okay to ban gay marriage . Homosexuality has links to crime too . Sodomy is a crime . Define harm becaue homosexuality is harmful according to many .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>This is not equality . You are using the letter of the law to twist the purpose of the law , and even then doing it using very shaky logic . Equality is about general concepts , not specifics . It is equality to say ' everyone is has the same right to worship who they want ' , it is not equality to say ' everyone has the same right to worship who we tell them to ' . That is equality within an unequal system , which cannot be counted . Can you re-phrase , I don't follow . No . As I said , those have strong links to criminal activity irrespective of the act itself being a crime . For example drug use has noted links to theft , the same just cannot be said for homosexuality . No it isn't . And even if it was , that has nothing to do with homosexuality anyway . Physical or psychological injury or damage . Homosexuality is therefore in no way harmful . And I have serous doubts about the ' many ' who say it is . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Equality is treating every person the same . However it does not mean treating every person's behavior the same . It does not mean treat every organization the same either . Everyone has the same rights . NOt every religous practice , ideology , or behavior get the same treatment . Teh people determine what is in the public's interest to protect and ban . It basically only the Christian practices that are completely legal . Islamic polgamy and other religons don't have their practices recognized as often as christianity . Homosexuality has strong links to sodomy . Also prostitution is legal in Nevada so shoudl all states be forced to allow taht behavior ? Insome states adults cann have sex wiht 14 - 16 yr olds in some cases . Should other states recognize that too ? Most serial killers of men and young boys were homosexuals . Sodomy is a crime do you wnat me to post it ? gynocologist , Gi specialists , and colon specialist have all stated the effects homosexual related activites . Also there is a higher risk of disease transmission among homosexual men so much so they are not allowed to donate blood for 5 yrs from their last activity .</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-1281_132_130_1_134_135_136_138_139_140_141_142_12<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I only have limited time to debate , so I have to pick my battles , so I'll pass on this one . I will make one point here . Heterosexual marriage is one of the most universal of all human institutions , found in almost all cultures ever existing . With a precedent like that , the question isn't , " Why Mr. Galton are you opposed to gay marriage ? " The question is how do you justify revolutionizing that ancient institution ? To me , heterosexual marriage is the Parthenon : ancient , beautiful , crumbling some of late , but it would be a tragedy to knock it down , clear it out , and put in a new building . You prove to me why that new building is so gotdamn necessary .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It is circular to say marriage has simply always been heterosexual , end of debate . No one is talking about knocking down marriage . Gay families want to enter into it , because they want their families strengthened and protected as heterosexual families have been strenghtened and protected . Gay families want into the institution because they want to be a positive influence on it , to support it and to shore it up , not because they desire to harm it . They are fighting to get into it , as some heterosexuals can't wait to get out of it . I can't see if it would make such a dramatic change just because the couple are the same sex . Also marriage in the U.S. and Canada falls under common-law . This is a " living law " meant to evolve with society , with much room for interpretation by judges . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You're gonna have to explain your circularity argument for us slow folks . And you're gonna have to back up your statement that gays as a group are really in their hearts conservatives , with a love of traditional institutions like marriage . I strongly suspect that you have some homosexuals who want the right to marriage for romantic reasons , some who want it for economic / legal privilege reasons , but also very many who want it so as to affirm that homosexuality is just as good as heterosexuality . It's the idea of we're just as good as you are , so we must be able to have everything you can have . For many , I suspect it is not a desire to adopt a more conservative lifestyle , but to make a point , and move the culture toward greater acceptance . This is a risky gamble to shove this down peoples ' throats as it may cause a backlash instead of greater legitimization of the lifestyle . Oh and you've got to be kidding me that gay marriage doesn't revolutionize marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Takes us back to where we started , assumes it absolutely must be and cannot be different or change . Sure , there are many who want acceptance from society , parents , friends , and that is a big reason why they marry , for gays or straights . If gays want their marriages to compete with heterosexual marriages , to prove gay marriages can be more successful , wouldn't that be good for the institution ? The old fashioned backlash argument is not a reason to not do something , and frankly is a little tired and worn-out in 2004 . Gays are just as good as you are . Is there a problem with gays believing and acting like they are just as good ? We don't have the strong sense of different gender roles we once had , so why is it such a revolutionary change ? I can't see that it has revolutionized the societies where it is in effect . It could have represented the next step in a very gradual continuation of acceptance that had been going on for a long time . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I am not arguing that heterosexual marriage must be as it has been or cannot be different . I am arguing that that revolutionizing such an important , ancient institution requires some heavy justification . People who have no respect for the past may not find my point compelling ; people who look to the past with deep respect and see in it old wisdom will find it compelling . I for one do not want to revolutionize an ancient institution I have great respect for , in order so the gay community can prove something . Tired argument ?! My god , how long have we been debating gay marriage ? Only four or five years ago in grad school , we were discussing how difficult it would be to see more and more rights to be extended to cohabiting gays couples , and we talked a little bit about gay civil unions . Marriage wasn't even on the damn table ! Homosexuality is an eccentricity ; in my mind it is not equal in value to heterosexuality . This is not an issue of how gays believe and act ; it is an issue of whether we are going to enshrine homosexual marriage as we do with heterosexual marriage . Gender , sexuality , and family organization are absolutely fundamental aspects of society -- always have been , always will be .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes , the hetero-only definition of marriage has been around a long time . However , simply because something is traditional does not make it just . Well that's how you see it because of your contempt for the gay community . You see it as " them " trying to step out of their lower place , or prove they are not lower than you and equal in value . Your last comment I've dealt with in this post , demonstrates that very well . Yes , the backlash threat is tired and boring . No one is listening anymore . Well , I remember people talking about marriage for gays and lesbians and their rights for much longer . Well , that says it all about where you are coming from . You believe homosexuals are human beings of lesser value . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I believe homosexual behavior is an eccentricity and not equal in value to heterosexuality . I was not referring to the value of persons ; I think homosexuals have as much intrinsic value as anyone else . I have contempt for no one . Your attempt to paint people who disagree with you as haters is unfair and a cheap debate tactic .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Homosexuals are persons who have homosexual behaviour . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>We are all sophisticated enough to separate behavior from person . I don't have to tell you that homosexuals are MUCH more than whom they prefer to sleep with .<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Yes , there is also homosexual orientation , which is part of the person's homosexual identity , and part of the person's homosexuality . The orientation leads to the behaviour .</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7185_117_110__122_126_134_148_150_151_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The court upheld equal protections . You accuse the court of illegitimate " judicial activism " for upholding such protections . Obviosly so far as you are concerned , if equal protections are upheld for gay Americans , it's illegitimate . Obviously not in the states that prohibit it . Can't you read the laws ? Indeed , the state and federal laws on the issue are specifically directed against gay people . It is woefully disingenuous of you to pretend otherwise . Another case of malicious disingenuity . Not even you can take it seriously with a straight face that these laws don't exist because gay people insist on equal rights , and homophobes want to deny them . If you don't know what equality means , by all means invest in a dictionary . Then you haven't much understanding of it . It applies to this case , and there are a large number of court decisions that agree with this understanding , this being just the latest . The straw men are all in your posts .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why can't you answer my question ? I simply said that it is illegitimate to say the constitution means one thing when it never has . I certainly can and there is nothing saying they can't within the restrictions by the law . Perhaps you don't . Let's look at marriage as an example . Marriage restrictions based on age , sex , species , number of , capacity , and perhaps a few other things . If you want " equal protection " the way you define it then all of these restrictions ( short of capacity ) would have to be removed . Is this what you mean by equal protection ? There seems to be more that disagree with you but that is beside the point . The only way you get to equal protection meaning what you want it to mean is if you evolve the constitution to a new meaning . If you can prove to me how gay marriage was part of the original meaning of the term " equal protection " then I'd be very much impressed . nice response Can you show me where I made a strawman ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Oh dear . I suppose I am extremely stupid in thinking that when a constitution says equal protections under the law , it means equal protections under the law . Evidently , it means : " Except gays " .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Can you show a document that suggests the original meaning of " equal protection " means equality for gays but not for other groups ? If you like I can explain the original understanding of the 14th amendment and how it wouldn't apply to gays unless they were denied marriage as defined today for being gay . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Can you show us a document that shows equality applies to groups other than gays ? Where does the Constitution say , " Except gays " ? Do you seriously imagine gay people want to marry the opposite sex ? Do you seriously think it is not an obstacle to their pursuit of life , liberty and happiness to prevent them from marrying the partners they love ? After all , you folk take your right to marry the consenting adults you love for granted , but for some pig-headed reason , you think it's OK to deny gay Americans the same rights you have . And you think that's constitutional ? Steve , that's bigotry .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are borderline breaking the rules of the forum . That aside , did you want me to explain the meaning of equal protection or not ? If it makes you feel better I wouldn't think it was denial of equal protection if marriage was denied as two men or two women marrying each other . No , they can't marry each other . Not sure how that is protection but if it is then consider gays protected too . I'm not saying you should think the way I do but at least I am trying to answer your questions and respond to your points . All you seem to be doing is ignoring my posts and insulting me . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>yawn . But since that is the denial of equal rights , obviously you would be wrong to think that . Nope . A very disingenuous argument . Gay partnerships are NOT protected the same way as straight ones -- in many places , they are illegal . That would be obvious even to a blind man , but not to someone deliberately denying the facts . I am pointing out that your opinions are wrong . As to why you make the erroneous arguments you do , i can only surmise .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No because in that case everyone is still allowed to marry under what marriage means . so is a daughter and father relationship which was the topic at hand ... Why are they wrong ? Why can't you explain why denial of some things that aren't equal is ok and doesn't violate equal protection but with gay marriage it does ? It is this question that makes or breaks your entire argument .</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10073_48_44__49_51_52_56_58_61_66_68_70_75_77_4<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I really wish that you would read my posts before commenting . I have clearly stated that gay marriages should not be prohibited . I am stating .. and you have posted nothing to make me think otherwise ... that gay marriage is simply not the same as hetero marriage and to recognise this is not to discriminate against it . If gays are allowed to marry then any kind of marriage between consenting adults should be allowed .. otherwise you are discriminating against the person wanting to enter into the marriage , however distasteful it appears to you .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>but there is a problem with polygamist marriages and whatever else youre talking about ( polygamy is the only thing i can come up with right now ... help me out ? ) . to us , theres no moral difference between marriage between a man and a woman and marriage between a man and a man or a woman and a woman . in a polygamist marriage , harm is done to many potential people , and there is an infringment of human rights in polygamist marriages . in homosexual marriages , no one gets hurt and no one's rights are infringed . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Morals have nothing to with it Bennedict . Its about definition . Morality is in the mind of the beholder so if you are happy that gay marriage is not morally wrong then you should be free to hold that opinion . However , gay marriage is not the same as hetero marriage . A gay married couple is as different from a hetero marriage as a man married to his father . As for polygamist marriages .. if all parties agree then there is no infringement of human right ... if we allow gay marriages then we cannot prohibit polygamous marriages .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>there is such a thing as social morals though . and both incest and polygamy go against the morals of society - our society at least . first of all , most women who agree to polygamous marriages are heavily brainwashed into doing so . in a gay marriage , no one is indoctrinated into doing it . but monogamous marriages are part of our culture and its socially ' wrong ' to step outside of that ; but regardless , it doesnt make any sense to say that if you allow a gay couple to get married , you open up a massive flood door of anyone getting married to anyone or anything . there are boundaries and its simply unfair to place gay people out of those boundaries just because theyre gay . can i get married to my own foot ? no . why ? because ... its just not right . and that's polar opposite thinking from allowing gay marriage . and of course gay marriage is different . that doesnt mean it shouldnt happen . interracial marriages are different from same-race marriages , but those are ok ... i hope . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not so long ago gay sex was considered beyond the pale let alone gay marriage so really morals have nothing to do with the gay marriage debate . Unless we allow for gay marriage to be prohibited again when enough people find it immoral . We should ban all marriages that are the result of coersion but we cannot ban a certain type of marriage in case one or more of the participants are coersed . The example of you marrying your own foot shows a little bit of desperation IMO and is not worth commenting on . Monogamous marriages between a man and a woman are part of our culture not all forms of monogamous marriages . Interacial marriages are exactly the same as same race marriages .. there is no difference whatsoever . Gay marriages are different to opposite sex marriages .. for reasons explained<br><b> S2:3-  </b>before the 1960 s , interracial marriages were banned in the southern states , obviously due to discrimination . today , the ban on gay marriage is more of the same . - many of the arguments against repealing the interracial ban were very similar to what your arguments are . i disagree and think there is absolutely no difference between interracial marriage bans and homosexual marriage bans . i assume youll agree with me in saying that interracial couples have every right to get married , even though it was previously expressed that it shouldnt happen . people woke up and realized that it was wrong on racial grounds . im just confused as to why people are playing the same cards against gay marriage and not realizing that it boils down to nothing more than discrimination . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The history of interracial marriage discrimination has nothing to do with my point . You do not seem to undestand that ... I DO NOT THINK THAT GAY MARRIAGE SHOULD BE PROHIBITED .. no matter how many times I post this . A black man marrying a white girl is exactly the same thing as a black man marrying a black girl . A man marrying a man is a completely different relationship than and man marrying a woman . Discrimination only becomes a part of the debate when one proposes that gays CANNOT be married ..... not when one recognises that the marriage between gays and straights are different . I think that you and ohio are bigots to be honest . You are just placing your own discrimination one place up . Saying that polygamous marriages or incestuous are immoral or bad for society is just as discriminatory as prohibiting gay marriages but you justify this by insisting that gay marriage is the same as hetero marriage and scurrilously use racial discrimination as a strawman<br><b> S2:4-  </b>i apologize gansao . your way of thinking is very interesting and i got mislead . i still disagree , there is a difference , but so what ? allowing gays to marry isnt an invitation for any type of marriage . and i already mentioned how polygamous or incestious marriage are wrong - because in polygamous marriages , women are being brainwashed into marrying a man who has 48 other wives and thats an infringment of her rights . in incestuous marriage , so many things are wrong that i dont even want to get into it . theres a difference to people who arent used to vast differences , especially in something like marriage , but its equal and the same to people who have been exposed to diversity within society . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Why women ? Why cant women have polygamous marriages with men ? Some women are forced into opposite sex marriages . Incestuous marriages are not wrong if same sex marriages are ok . The only arguments you have against incestuous marriages is a moral one or an icky factor and both of these can be applied just as effectively to a gay marriage .<br><b> S2:5-  </b>ill get back to you - im researching opinions of polygamous and incestuous relationships . i might actually agree with you . <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Ill be honest with you Bennedict ... I am arguing a small frame opinion . That is ... gay marriage equals breaking the mould therefore opening up a revolutionary change in the idea of marriage .... leading beyond gay marriage to acceptance of multiple kinds of marriage .

I look forward to the results of your<br><b> S2:6-  </b>i read some stuff and thought it over while making a lovely spicy mediterranean pasta and have come to the conclusion that if two ( or more ) people are consenting to marriage , why the hell not ? with polygamy , indoctrination would be a major issue and that would have to be sorted ... but i think for now , with the society that we live in , people would start freaking out if we just lifted the ban on all of these marriage taboos . so for the time being , im anti-polygamy and anti-incestuous marriage on the basis that people like easyrider would freak out entirely . im always looking out for my home-boi . <br><b>S1:7-  </b>Exactly .. this seems the way it works . 50 or so years ago the UK decriminalised gay sex ... no one ever thought that gays would ever be allowed to marry In another 50 years time ... who knows The society I would like to see is a tolerant one that allows everyone to find their own way to hell ..

Do you not think that we are a family that deserves all the same protections of heterosexual couples ?

What makes my family any different and less deserving of equal protections including marriage than any other families ? We have two parents and will be the parents of two children with full custody . Please if you can describe to me what makes my family less deserving of the full protections given to that of heterosexual headed households and what makes us different besides the fact that one of us is not a woman ( is that better ) .

If no one did then you are responsible for your children , not me .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>My children are in no way " outsourced " as they are my biological children . No one is asking for YOU to care for my children as I have all the same taxes and other responsiblities to my government as you do . Please try to answer my question as to why my family is less deserving of government benefits than a heterosexual headed household . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Depends on your circumstances . They may be more deserving of government benefits than some heterosexual households . Do you need to marry your partner to recieve these benefits ? Are you more deserving than a single parent that deliberately has a clutch of children then moans because of lack of government support ?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>With full civil marriage equality , a whole host of benefits are brought about to strengthen my family such as survivors benefits for social security as just one example . Another example would be my husband , given that marriage equality were a reality , would automatically gain guardianship of our children were anything to happen to me . These of course are only a couple of the more than a thousand benefits marriage brings about . Certainly , you may argue that contracts drawn by a paid attorney or myself could reap these same benefits , but I do not understand what legitimate reason my family must jump through these hoops when heterosexual headed households are not required , asked or even expected to do the same . Two parents , two children , participating and supporting equally with our governments requirements as any other family , however receiving no reciprocation from the government to strengthen and protect my famly as It does heterosexual headed families . And no , I am certainly not more deserving than anyone else . We do not nor have not ever asked for a handout of any kind anymore than saying that a heterosexual headed household is asking for a handout when the parents are married . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>As you pointed out , it is only heterosexual couples that get to marry and reap the benefits from it . In a modern secular society there is no reason not to extend marriage to other forms of relationships . However just extending marriage to gay couples is not enough , it must be extended to all permutations of sexual relationships and society must look at sexual relationships that are otherwise banned . I cannot see why marriage should be granted to you but an incestuous relationship be illegal . Making homosexual sex legal is a far cry to making gay relationships officially equal to hetero ones . You are no ' better ' than two half brothers having a sexual relationship or a mother and son ..o r indeed a polygamous gay relationship ... it all deviates from the present definition of marriage . If you get it , everyone should get it .<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Would you agree that each form of proposed marriage arrangements would need to be argued on their own merits separately ? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Yes bit it should be considered in one package . I dont see why gays should have their relationships officialised ( is that a word ? ) and pull up the ladder so other types of relationships cannot follow . Before gay marriage is allowed then all types of sexual relationships should be considered . Lets face it , it would be far harder for people to accept a complete revolution in what we consider to be an appropriate relationship to become an official family than to just allow gays to do it ... using the very arguments that gays have to justify them officially marrying we can justify most other type of marriage . So to prohibit other forms of marriage would be tantamount to discrimination</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3089_96_94__97_99_103_105_108_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>As I already stated Kerry expected to carry Ohio and got smashed there ........ Ohio passed a Gay marriage amendment and the silent majority spoke there as they did through out the U.S. re electing President Bush by 3 million a bigger margin then " Slick Willie " ever got .........<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This statement seems incorrect in too many ways for me to let it stand . First , to assume that the majority of people in Ohio were either silent about their views on same-sex marriage or on their choice for president is utter nonsense . They were absolutely as loud-mouthed about it as anyone else . Your implications that there is some " silent majority " imply a misunderstanding of the political battlefield , and I hope I have been able to clear it up . Next , although Bush won by a larger margin than Bill Clinton ( who you term " slick Willie " for no other reason than to anger and insult his supporters , I assume ? ) , this does not mean that Clinton did not win by a larger percentage . Remember that population increases over time , and there was a slightly higher voter turnout in this election due to its controversy . Even though Bush by a large number of voters compared to previous elections , he won by a marginal percentage due to the fact that the population of the US has increased . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Actually the population growth has nothing to do with the margin of victory ... I am talking about the votes President Bush won by and " Slick Willie " did not even get a 50 percent majority in either the 1992 and the 1996 election ......... He was very lucky that Perot ran in 1992 otherwise Bush would have defeated him ....... I am sure you have heard the term silent majority before ......... These are the people that when they vote make all the polls that the left wing media put out like the presidents approval rating is down or how bad the economy is or how bad the war in Iraq is going .......... If you think that morals and the gay marriage issue had no bearing in the president winning Ohio then you are living in a state of denial my friend ........<br><b> S2:2-  </b>In 2000 , Gore had 48.4% of the popular vote , while Bush had 47.9% . That gives Bush a negative . 5% in popular vote . In 2004 , Bush had 51% of the popular vote while Kerry had 48.1% . That gives Bush a victory by 2.9% of the popular vote . In comparison , Clinton in 1992 had 43% of the vote while Bush Sr. had 37.4% of the vote , which gives Clinton a win by 5.6% . In 1996 , Dole had 40.7% of the vote while Clinton had 49.2% of the vote , which gives Clinton the win by 8.5% . Clinton clearly had far greater victories than Bush ever did , the difference was that there was a competent third candidate running in both of Clinton's wins . http://mediamatters.org/items/200411150007 I have heard the term silent majority in the past , but it cannot refer to a majority which was not silent . The majority in Ohio ( and all of those other 11 states ) was in fact very , very vocal . Every poll was accurate . The term " silent majority " is not appropriate . I have no doubt that majority's desire to oppress the minority did play some factor in Bush's win in Ohio , but statistics suggest that it was a very small part . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Just for your information getting a majority of the vote means over 50 percent ........ Why was Kerry so sure he was going to win Ohio ? It is becasue the silent majority stood up big time ...........<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I did not say that this is not what the majority means . I was addressing the implications of your post , which is that Bush was more supported than Clinton . That is untrue . And why was Bush so sure he was going to win Michigan ? Actually Bush wasn't so sure he was going to win Michigan , and Kerry wasn't so sure he was going to win Ohio . Asking why Kerry was so sure he was going to win Ohio assumes the false premise that Kerry was so sure he was going to win it . In fact , he was not . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>President Bush did not win Michigan in 2000 and it would have been and upset if he won it 2004 but in every state that he lost in 2000 he picked up a bigger percent of the vote in 2004 ........

All the protesting in the world wouldn't have brought it about if the will of the people were not changing to make it happen . At the end of the day , any legislative movement needs the will of the people to be successful . It may not need a full majority in some cases , but it needs enough people on board . That's why legislation requires not only voting ( by legislature ) , but elected officials to do so as well . There was a process our country went through on those issues as whether or not they were legitimate in terms of the law -- it involved a national debate , protests , etc. Sometimes this process results in our country ( the people ) granting civil rights legislation , and sometimes it doesn't ( depending on whether it is deemed warranted ) . The process ( which will undoubtedly take years ) is going on right now in regards to gays . Time will tell what the result will be . Any form of legislation is a voting matter . That's the way our system works .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why is it that whenever this comes up you insist on conflating " the people voting on a law " with " the legislature voting on a law " or " the people electing politicians " ?

Or at least try to , and hope someone doesn't derail the conversation into irrelevant issues like how the legislature works . I will echo the point that several have made here . The idea of allowing the masses to determine civil rights is stupid and wrong . If a group's civil rights need protecting , then they need protecting from the very masses that are doing the voting . Ballot measures may be a legal process , but that doesn't prevent them from being stupid and wrong , now does it ? That's the point that's trying to be made here . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well , that's up to you . If you don't want to derail it , you don't have to . It seems to me that what is really happening in society with these ballot initiatives and other parts of the process is determining whether or not it is a civil right in the first place to give legal marriage to whatever group arrangement is in question . ( In this case , gays couples . ) That process has to take place ; it is just not feasible in our society to give marriage equality to any group of any arrangement that comes along demanding it until we determine for certain that it needs to be done . If society determines that same-sex arrangements of two people should suffice to redefine marriage for it to be included , then so be it . But that process has to be there in some form , realistically . If you are going to draw the line in terms of what can be voted on a ballot initiative or not , what authority determines that ? How are you going to determine where that line is drawn ? And you can't just arbitrarily say " when civil rights are being infringed " because that doesn't carry any legal weight -- it's opinion . Just saying it's " stupid " and " wrong " may be your point being made , but it's a point that doesn't offer any solutions .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You really are a piece of work . All you're saying here is that if society wants to be bigoted it should be allowed to be . Very libertarian of you , but I believe that if the power of the government can be used to fight evil and prejudice , it should . If wrong is happening , and the government can stop it , it should . You will of course claim that the government can't do anything , but history has proven that position wrong . The government has taken stands against biggotry before , and while it hasn't eradicated it , it has improved things . Gee , now I'm supposed to offer solutions before you even get what the point is ? I'm I allowed to use both hands while I type ? Any other restrictions you want to add ?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-6646_209_208__210_211_212_214_215_239_7<br><b>S1:1-  </b>[ QUOTE = gaetano ; 255273 ] As you say , marriage is a public institution and like all institutions has its rules and requirements . If you want to change those rules and requirements then by all means lobby to do so . You are entitled to do so . Equally people who do not wish to change the rules and regulations are entitled to lobby to keep the status quo . You only BELIEVE gays have the right to marriage . Other people BELIEVE they do not . Ask for a vote on it and abide by the majority decision .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Isn't cruel and unjust to decide that someone else should not have what you enjoy ? How would you feel if the world was the other way around . How would you feel if the world were gay and you as a heterosexual were being told you couldn't marry the person you loved because it was against someone elses , that you didn't know or have never met , religious beliefs or that they have some sort of ikk factor ? Can you not put youself in the place of gay people and ask yourself how would I feel ? Do you have any empathy ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>In answer to your first question as it stands , No , it happens all the time . If society had set up the institution of marriage as a gay one since OG was in his cave then I would certainly try and lobby otherwise if I disagreed . If the lobbying failed and the rest of Society said we keep things the way we want them however sorry they may feel , then I would clearly have to abide by that , although lobbying would continue . However castigating people because of their beliefs or stating they shouldn't have them , must be wrong . Otherwise I could claim that you are not entitled to your beliefs which clearly you are<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That is not what I asked you . Do you really lack any empathy ? I didn't ask you what you would do I asked you how you would feel . Let's try again How would you feel if the world was the other way around ? How would you feel if the world were gay and you as a heterosexual were being told you couldn't marry the person you loved because it was against someone elses , that you didn't know or have never met , religious beliefs or that they have some sort of ikk factor ? Can you not put youself in the place of gay people and ask yourself how would I feel ? Do you have any empathy ? For the record I do not believe I have the right to tell anyone who they should be allowed to marry but many of those that are anti same sex marriage think that they have a right to tell people who they should be allowed to marry . Just because something happens all the time does not mean it is not cruel and unjust . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>First of all it is not against " someone else's beliefs " in that incredibly simplistic way . It is against the beliefs of society since the year dot , religious beliefs or ' ikk ' factor whatever that is are irrelevant even if they contribute to some people's attitudes . Second yes I would probably feel sad if I wasn't allowed to marry the person I was with BUT I would be with the person I love in any event . Thirdly , as marriage is looked on as a public institution then Society as a whole is entitled to lay down the rules relating to it just as Society lays down the rules and laws by which we live . Cruelty and injustice occur when you are stopped from doing something you are entitled to do . Gay marriage at present is not something you are entitled to it would seem . Have to say in the UK we have made some steps towards that .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I really think you can not put yourself in someone elses place . So you believe that " Cruelty and injustice occur when you are stopped from doing something you are entitled to do . " ? Is this correct ? So if I use your belief on another topic , say slavery , you then would conclude that slavery was neither cruel nore injust 1 since it was a legal and traditional activity practiced since OG was in the cave 2 slaves should not think it was cruel and unjust because they had no legal rights and standing and thus was not cruel and unjust since they were slaves . My point is just because something is the law or not the law does not make it any less cruel or unjust when viewed from a certain perspective . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Firstly I am not even going to put slavery on the same level as gay marriage . I frankly do not believe that the alleged suffering gays not being allowed to marry comes in any way close to the suffering of slaves . Secondly you are of course perfectly correct about cruelty and injustice ( neither or certainly the first one do I think apply to gay marriage ) and the way forward was to lobby etc as Wilberforce did to abolish slave trade . We can only advance in civilisation ( I hope ) but lobbying publicity etc can help people's awareness in bring matters before their eyes to decide on . There will always be minorities of dissenters ( strange world if none ) but in the last analysis Society determines how it is run . You talk about the tyranny of the majority but of course the reverse can also be true .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I am not comparing the two . I am using your own beliefs and statements and appling them to slavery .</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10349_9_5__17_40_43_50_52_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The cultural meaning of marriage is a formalization of a mating pair , who , in turn , create and support a family unit . Love and reproduction are implied . The legal meaning of marriage is , in most States , a contract between two people who are not under the age of consent , of different genders , of the same species , not closely related and who are not already married . Homosexuals are not a part of the traditional or cultural meaning of marriage . In order to be included , the meaning of marriage would have to change . The catch-22 is that homosexual couples want to be included in the current meaning of marriage , but what gives marriage meaning specifically excludes homosexual couples .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That's your definition . It is certainly not my definition . You don't speak for all of society . I personally define marriage as a union of two people who love one another and wish to make a commitment to one another . If marriage is about reproduction , why does nobody bat an eye when a 65 year old woman marries a 68 year old man ? If you believe marriage is " formalization of a mating pair " , and " reproduction is implied " , doesn't this cheapen the institution of marriage in your eyes ? Obviously , they are not getting married to start a family ... perhaps love is what is important ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Mating pairs exist with or without marriage , and have no legal connection with marriage ( since , legally , it doesn't matter if the two people even like one another , or ever intend on consumating said marriage ) . The only connection between a mating couple and marriage is the connection made on a cultural level . So , logically , the cultural meaning of marriage would be the purpose of a mating couple . While ' purpose ' can mean different things , in this context I daresay most would refer to the evolutionary purpose of a mating couple : reproduction . Love is implied because love brings the couple together for that purpose . While legally a 27 yr old marrying a 70 yr old sugar daddy is not a problem , culturally speaking this marriage is not as meaningful as one that is in-line with the evolutionary purpose I outlined above . You can point to exceptions all you want , but all it does is outline the difference between the legal meaning and the cultural meaning of marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Who gave you the power to decide what is culturally meaningful ? And more importantly , should we legally define marriage based on your perception of " cultural meaning " ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No , you should legally define it any damn way you can get away with . The cultural definition comes from observation .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But who get's to decide that legal definition ... that's the point . In this specific case in point , the anti crowd wishes to limit the rights of others simply based on personally held beliefs ... when no harm is presented to any party involved . In a case such as this , I feel strongly that without a specific vector of harm , we must as a civilized society rule in favor of providing equal rights rather than limit rights of a minority . I think these 4 pages thus far make clear that cultural definition is based on subjective obeservation and personal opinion formed via that observation . Clearly , I and many others here do not share your cultural definition . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>In America the people generally vote on issues , or elect representatives to enact laws . That's how you change the legal definitions . This isn't about equality , snakespit . The title of this thread shows that :P In all seriousness , though , it really isn't about equality . I don't think you have a rational basis upon which to dispute that observation . It is an indisputible fact that the cultural view that has dominated this country ( as evidenced by the definition of marriage ) generally follows evolutionarily sound logic : monogamous pair bonding outside of close familial ties . Inclusion of homosexuals would obviously change that .</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10349_72_70__75_82_83_84_85_86_87_88_89_90_94_95_99_4<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I'm speaking of everyone who lives in the society ... it's implicit that we agree to live by the laws of that society :P A social contract , if you will . That's why we're punished for breaking those laws . Change them , sure ... break them , no . Well , I certainly disagree with your point of view ... what have I said that points to religion ? If the meaning were solely based upon religion then it would be an arbitrary custom . But it's based upon biology , which isn't an arbitrary difference .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>As long as 70 year olds are allowed to marry then you have lost that arguement . What is the difference between a couple of 70 year olds and a gay couple ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>A heterosexual bond's ultimate causation is to facilitate reproduction . Pointing out a particular couple who does not reproduce would not change that fact :P Marriage is a formalization of that bond . Rofl , you would still have a problem with that , don't lie . After all , OMG THEY HAVE BENEFITS YOU DON'T GET OMG . And that's unconstitutional isn't it , Matthew S. At least according to your flawed reasoning .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I want equality . The lack of is what I find unconstitutional and unjust . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Surely , and in your little scenario married people still have benefits that you don't get . So it's a lie that you'd ' be ok with that ' since you've been pretty loudly outspoken about that very point . That if anyone has benefits you don't get then it must be unconstitutional .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I have had this idea for years . http://www.4forums.com/political/gay...man-woman.html <br><b>S1:4-  </b>lol , so what ? You've also been braying about how if some people have benefits that you don't have access to ( and in your scenario it would be much less possible for you to get those benefits ) then it must be unconstitutional . So either you're a hypocrite or you don't actually pay attention to what you say .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I actually have a marriage license . The same license that everyone gets from the state of Iowa , yet my license is not recognized by either the federal government or the state of Michigan , how is that not unconstitutional ? Why are those the only two options ? I want equality and I don't care how it comes about . If my rules where applied to marriage , yes it would suck , but I would then be treated equally to those heteros , who currently do not breed , can not breed , or choose not to breed , yet can get a marriage license at the drop of a hat and have it recognized . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Because the Constitution does not require them to :P It has been long established that States have authority over marriage definitions . Because , gasp , they get marriage benefits while you do not ! Are you saying it's equal for some people to get marriage benefits but single people do not ?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>What is it about the same piece of paper you do not understand ? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>The reason you have that paper is the same reason other States don't have to honor it . That reason is : States decide for themselves what constitutes a marriage . I'm still interested in the fact that you're ok with some people getting marriage benefits and others not getting them .<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Once again the state of Iowa issues one piece of paper to everyone . What part of that do you not understand ? The other states and the federal government must recognize all or none . If marriage is to be about breeders and breeding children , and my rules are adopted by the state then yes I am alright . If my rules were adopted then almost no one would get married , and those who get married have to breed if they don't they are no longer married . They have to have 3 witnesses to their act of breeding , along with a video of the event stored in the public records of the county were they live . <br><b>S1:7-  </b>I understand every part of that . Nothing makes States recognize all or none , Matthew S. In fact , it's been true since the ratification that States establish their own marriage laws ... and anyone in the State is subject to those marriage laws . It doesn't matter what other States say about your marriage because you're not in those States . No you aren't because some people would have marriage benefits but you will not . You've been very vocal that if anyone gets marriage benefits when you do not then it must be unconstitutional . Are you now saying that it's perfectly Constitutional for only some people to get marriage benefits ? And you're wrong , of course . People would get married . Besides ' having witnesses ' ( which is for the signing of the contract not the execution , duh ) , a lifelong relationship with children is the ideal marriage . It's what people hope to have .<br><b> S2:7-  </b>And why would gay people be any different ? What we have is you saying to me that I can't get married because you have some belief against it . I wish I could say to you , you can't go to that place or do that thing because I have a belief against you doing so . <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Saying heterosexuals are the same as homosexuals is political fiction . At some point you'll have to realize that biological differences exist and sometimes that has ramifications for how you're treated . It's a bit like being left-handed ; the world is sort of built around people being rightys . Sorry . You're sitting there demanding the world be changed to suit leftys as if it is your due , while at the same time casually denying that anything was made for rightys in the first place . It's insulting , ignorant and arrogant . I'd oppose you for those reasons alone :P You can . You really can . All you need is for a lot of people to agree with you .</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-5672_18_7__22_24_25_29_30_33_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Yes it does , because what is happening here is that ' family ' and ' marriage ' are being redefined . It is being broadened . People like Colson believe that marriage and family fits a certain criteria for it to truly be a marriage . That criteria IS traditional marriage , and if that changes that in Colson's eyes traditional marriage IS affected . I don't see how you can say that adopting gay marriage has no effect on that . I've heard Colson speak , BTW ; he speaks all over the country . I agree with some of what he's said and some I don't . He would say the same thing about kids raised in single parent homes ; but it's not that he's saying single parent homes are bad ; he's saying that homes with a mother and father are the best scenario . I think that's what he's saying here too . He's basically saying that by his observations of prisons , that traditional families do best in terms of raising children and them staying out of prison . Whether he's right or not is another matter , but I think it's important to at least represent the man's statements correctly here .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>He's done pretty well for a felon . Yet no constitutional amendment banning single-parenthood . How odd ... I wonder how long it will be before folks like Colson and you stop drawing conclusions about same-sex couples from your observations of single-parenthood . Never , I suppose . sigh <br><b>S1:2-  </b>How do you know he wouldn't support one if it were up for a vote ? I wonder how long it will be before folks like you stop claiming things that aren't happening ? I don't draw such conclusions . Sorry . . . accidentally misworded that . No " game " intended at all . I had no idea you've never had a typing mistake in your life .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That was a particularly bad volley . ( see below ) No , you just find them " compelling " . The game I'm talking about has nothing to do with that omission . The game , as you well know , is to engage in disagreement on every possible point . It's right there in your job description . Page 3 , paragraph 2 and 5 . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Look , there's really no need to be hostile here . With all due respect , I do agree on the record here sometimes with people who support gay rights . For instance , I've said I agree the amendment is a bad thing . I've said on numerous occassions that I agree that gays experience violence and harassment and measures must be taken to change that . I've agreed with the gay rights stance on gay adoption . I've agreed that gays shouldn't have to face job and housing discrimination . I've agreed on numerous things . Those aren't instances of disagreement , but of agreement . Maybe I just haven't often found your comments agreeable .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes , I know . You may remember that I pointed out your opposition to the amendment to another poster just the other day . It's precisely the discrepancy between your stated beliefs and your constant arguments in opposition to them that lead people to believe that you do not , in fact , support gay rights . There are other possibilities , of course . Personally , I've latched onto the idea that you're paid to be here . I realize it's a bit silly , but , frankly , it's the least morally repugnant one I can come up with , and I hate to think ill of people I don't know . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>What evv . I've latched onto the idea that you're main reason for being here is to post beligerantly about and to posters you disagree with about THEM rather than the topics at hand .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Sometimes it's hard to tell if people are going ghetto or going gay . Can you describe the hand gestures that went with that ?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-5672_6_5__7_13_15_16_17_20_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Actually , I think it's probably the most compelling argument I've read for the amendment . The be fair , I don't think the author is claiming there is a direct link between gay marriage and crime . He seems to be talking about overall effect on society and traditional family . But I'm still against the amendment ; amending the constitution over something like this is just not the right thing to do .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>" compelling argument " ? So do you believe the basis of what he's claiming ? And are you ready to debate it ? Because there is no " overall effect on society and traditional family " from gay marriage . The " traditional family " has been having its OWN problems , and has been in decline in these countries LONG BEFORE gay marriage ever was legalized . It's like a guy jumping out of an airplane , and he starts falling to the ground . Three seconds later gay marriage is legalized , and conservatives want to blame the fact that he's falling on gay marriage ... It makes no sense . There is no causality here ... Do straight people say , " Hey ! Gay marriage is legal . I don't want to get married now . " Do straight people say , " Hey ! Gay marriage is legal . I want to get a divorce now . " The " most compelling argument " lacks any semblance of sense . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes it does , because what is happening here is that ' family ' and ' marriage ' are being redefined . It is being broadened . People like Colson believe that marriage and family fits a certain criteria for it to truly be a marriage . That criteria IS traditional marriage , and if that changes that in Colson's eyes traditional marriage IS affected . I don't see how you can say that adopting gay marriage has no effect on that .

I don't see how you can say that it DOES have an effect on that . Tell me , for starters , WHAT effect it will happen . Will Colson get a divorce if gay marriage is legalized ? Will Colson wish he had never gotten married if gay marriage is legalized ? THEY are claiming SPECIFIC effects . NEGATIVE effects . Effects that should be PROVEN for them to be claimed ... HOW can they claim those SPECIFIC DETRIMENTAL effects from gay marriage onto OTHER PEOPLE's marriages ??? Where's the proof ? 1 ) Studies DO back-up the issue of " single vs dual parent house-holds " . And that is common sense . Two heads are better than one . Twice the capability to care . 2 ) Studies REFUTE the claims that dual heterosexual parents are better than dual gay parents . They aren't . Gay parents are just as good . The gender of the parents are irrelevant . The sexual orientation of the parents is irrelevant . Where did I misrepresent something Jyoshu ? He's claiming a SPECIFIC DETRIMENTAL EFFECT on families due to gay marriage . THAT is what I'm talking about . THAT is what I want proven , if he's going to claim it . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Easy . . . marriage in the defined sense will be changed . It will be more broadened . Where did he claim that ? All I see is that he feels that traditional families are better in terms of kids from them staying out of prison . It seemed to me you were representing this as someone ' blaming ' gay marriage for crime . If that's not what you meant , then fair enough .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Is that ALL the effect you are claiming then ? Are you then contradicting the previous article's claim that it will have a negative effect on heterosexual marriages ? Did you read the article Jyoshu ? Do you even know what we're talking about ? Again , did you READ the article Jyoshu ? Because if not , then why did you claim : " Actually , I think it's probably the most compelling argument I've read for the amendment . " For Jyoshu's edification : If you don't comprehend that is PRECISELY what the author IS doing , then I don't know what to tell you . It's there in black and white ! <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I never said I was compelled , or convinced by the article . I said it was probably the most compelling that I've seen . I see nothing in that quote blaming gay marriage for crime , directy OR even indirectly . You are making an inference --o ne that may or may NOT be intended . I would think if Colson's point was to lay blame for crime he would have simply said so . He didn't . Colson is simply opposing thge amendment because he believes that traditional families are best in terms of avoiding crime . I don't really agree either -- I think there are too many variables for that to automatically be the case .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Oh . I see . So if somebody said " Christianity causes cancer " , that would be a compelling argument for people to not be Christians . Right ? Give me a freakin ' break Jyoshu . READ the article . It's talking about gay marriage and the effects of it on society . It makes claims that : 1 ) Gay marriage will cause detriment to straight marriages . 2 ) Detriment to straight marriages , e.g. single parent families , yield greater instances of criminals . It's all right there . In plain English . I am making no " inference " . This IS what the author is saying . Then explain to me his next paragraph where he links LEGALIZATION of gay marriage to a decrease in " traditional families " . Can't you put two and two together ? And Colson is not " opposing " the amendment . He's SUPPORTING it . From the article : " This is just one reason that I am so passionately in favor of the Marriage Protection Amendment ... " Can't you even get THAT right ? Or are you so lost in obfuscation that you've confused yourself ?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10585_36_34__39_52_54_64_65_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Bert and Ernie are not gay !!

This is what makes me so sick about your hypocrisy . You seperate the sex from marriage just when it suits you . You want two male characters to be homosexual and take out the homosexual sex element just when it suits you . But two men could live together and be extremely close without being homosexual .. the homosexual element comes in at the genital fondling stage . You know it but cry ' dirty minds ' when this is stated . Pathetic and Miss piggy and kermit are interspecies but not portrayed as sexually active but gays like you want us to believe bert and ernie are .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No . You can portray some of the straight human characters as being married , without it being anything close to an adult sex film . In this case , some are just saying they would like two charcters who are both male to be married . Straight or gay can discuss the fact of marriage , without getting into sex act details or even touching the topic of sex acts . I believe that , and if you don't when it comes to gays , it is indeed you who has the dirty mind where the topic at hand is concerned . Who else has mentioned sex acts ? No one . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Well once we you have same sex marriages then you may have straight men marrying . There may be advantages in this for some straight men . However it seems that the people who wish to see Ernie and Bert get married are men who have sex with each other . You and other gays want Bert and Ernie to be seen as gay men ie men who are sexually attracted to other men . You are all the more sickenly dishonest by pretending otherwise . One does not need to actually show or discuss the sexual acts of people when describing their sexuality ... you are the one that is stupidly suggesting this . However the fact remains that people do have sex and gays have a deviant form of it . There is no evidence that Bert and Ernie have deviant sex but you want them to be described as such but under the guise of ' married ' .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Straight men can already get married to women , so what the hell would be the point of marrying a man if it's not your orientation and you can have everything in marriage anyway ?! No , not necessarily . It can be celibate gay men or straight people who support gay inclusion and think this is the correct way to accomplish it . You can de-emphasize the sexual part , because you are dealing with children , the same way you do from different sex marriages . Nope .
