  <line>This is about gay marriage. S1 seems to believe that someone is making religion into law by saying marriage should be between a heterosexual couple. S2 is arguing that S1's point is not very valid because S1 is not understanding that they are not using the persons perspective. S1 believes that that person is trying to hurt them, while S2 is saying that the person may not necessarily be that way and that the person may be arguing for what they believe to be greater for society, based on their own perspective. S1's religious view of marriage is based on two people's love for each other, while the other person believes its between a man and woman. S2 says S1's argument is empty and that S1 is not showing how the other person is being hurt by gay marriage. S2 thinks S1 is not understanding the overall perspectives and just focusing on their own needs. S1 states that the person's religion put into law affects peoples ability to marry if they are gay, but that S1's religion on marriage put into law would not affect marriage for anyone.</line>

  <line>S1 and S2 are discussing gay marriage in the context of an unknown she that is pushing a law to ban gay marriage. S1 believes that her religious freedom is being persecuted from people against gay marriage.  S1 believes this will result in her family not having legal protection. S2 doesnt believe that S1s religious freedom is being persecuted because she is still bale to hold religious ceremonies. S2 believes the same argument can be made fro m her perspective. S1s believe of marriage is that it should be based on love and not on sex. S2 argues that the religious freedom argument could be used in any format to justify any action. S1 is angered that the religious freedom of another person will go into law and bar her from marriage so she can sustain her heterosexual privilege.  S2 disagrees and thinks she is doing what she thinks is before society. S1 and S2 seem to get annoyed with each other by the end of dialog.</line>

  <line>(S1) says that his religious freedom is being ignored by a politician attempting to make her religious beliefs law.  This law limits legal protection of gay couples and it is not use to protect marriage but heterosexual privilege. (S2)  questions how the politicians view is imposing on (S1) religious freedom. (S1) responds that he believes that marriage should be between two people who love each other and not her/politicians belief that marriage should be between man and woman. However, (S2) says that the argument surrounding religious freedom is an empty argument because anyone can argue for his or her beliefs using religion. (S1) says that gay marriage doesnt violate her/politicians rights of heterosexual privilege, entitlement since she is not protecting marriage but her beliefs. (S2) questions how (S1) religious rights are taken away or harmed. (S1) and (S2) discuss about whose religious belief is better for society. (S1) responds that the her/politicians interest is not part of his interests and or societys and does not hurts him in any way. </line>

  <line> S1 says that someone, her, is trying to put their religious beliefs into law that goes against the religious beliefs of S1.  The law would bar the family of S1 from legal protections but would not affect her. S1 believes that she isnt protecting marriage but preserving her heterosexual privilege. Her religious belief is that marriage should be between a man and a woman but S1 believes that marriage should be between two people in a loving relationship regardless of sex. If she put her religious belief into law it would hurt S1 but if the religious views of S1 are put into law she would still be able to choose who she wanted and S1 would be able to choose whomever. She is trying to keep gay people out of marriage.</line>

  <line> S2 understands the perspective of S1 but does not think it is a valid argument. S2 holds that either if either religious belief were put into law that it would infringe on the others beliefs. S2 claims that S1 has not shown how the religious beliefs would be taken away from such a law. It can be argued in other ways but the idea of not giving gays marriage benefits is imposing on religious freedom is an empty argument. S2 counters S1 by saying that it is impossible to know whether or not she is trying to turn religious belief into law. It is impossible to know or to police someones real motives.</line>

  <line>S1 is talking about a female who is ignoring S1s religious freedom and barring his family from legal protections. S2 questions to how she is impeding S1 from his religious freedom and argues that she isnt trying to take away his right from a religious ceremony. S1 says the womans religious belief is that marriage should be between a man and a woman, and S1s religious belief is that marriage can be between any two people that love each other regardless of their gender. If the womans religious belief gets incorporated in to the law, S1 will not be able to marry the person of his choice but she will still be able to marry regardless of the law. The woman is just trying to keep gay people out of marriage to preserve her heterosexual privilege. S2 argues that either one of them can be impeding on the others religious freedom. S1 does not give in and keeps arguing that she is trying to turn her religious belief into law and bar him from getting married. </line>
