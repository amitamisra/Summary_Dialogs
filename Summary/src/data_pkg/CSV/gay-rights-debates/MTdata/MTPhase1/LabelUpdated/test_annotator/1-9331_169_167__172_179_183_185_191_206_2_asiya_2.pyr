  <line>This debate is about the 9th and how the federal constitution applies to marriage. S1 and S2 begin by talking about trolling and potentially starting a new debate on abortion, which doesn't really have a lot of purpose in this conversation. S2 says that in saying people who want to get rid of gay marriage may have wanted to prevent inter-racial and inter religious marriage. S2 states that Maine's vote on gay marriage was an opinion on gay marriage, rather than the 9th being how the Federal Constitution applies to gay marriage. S2 also says that Bowers Justice Stevens doesn't have the evidence to withstand his analysis. They also bring up Lawrence v. Texas and S2 states that even when majority wants a law it isn't enough for the constitution challenge of the law. S2 goes back to saying how S1's arguments are flawed and that its too repetitive for this conversation, because S1 hasn't disproved anything. They go back to talking trash to each other and they end the conversation.</line>

  <line>S1 and S2 are in unfriendly argument about gay marriage. The argument originally starts in a tangent of Abortion.  S2 thinks that S1 is trolling the thread and briefly comment on abortion playing the devil advocate to shows the misuse of logic is S1's thinking for issues in gay marriage. S1 continues to antagonize S2. S2 continues to discuss the necessity of drawing boundaries in reason and the importance staying on track. S2 says they should use familiar comparison of attacks on inter-racial marriage where if you are against interracial marriage, you are for slavery,  to show his support of gay marriage, just to show S1that type of discourse is not logically accurate. S1 brings the &quot;9th&quot; from Maine and &quot;Prop 8&quot; from California as example of states that have showed that their majority was against gay marriage, but yet people in those states are still trying to get them overturned. S2 compliments S1 for clever banter. S2 ends the discussion by accusing S1 of repeating his points, which pertain to two separate issues. </line>

  <line>(S1) begins talking about the death of a child either by natural or in the hands of a doctor. (S1) also mentions that there are photos in the web and offers to debate about the topic. (S2) questions if (S1) is beginning to debate about abortion. (S2) also indicates playing devils advocate to also talk about gay rights in relation to abortion. (S2) compares abortion to the extermination of Jews in the Holocaust. (S1) bring to (S2)'s attention the overturning of the 9th in Maine's results. (S2) then states that the 9th is about hoe the FEDERAL CONSTITUTION applies to gay marriage. This means that the results reflect how the voters feel about gay marriage. (S2) talks about State's majority has traditionally seen an issue as immoral it is not enough to prohibit the practice and that intimate relationships are no one else's concern and it is a liberty by due process. (S1) talks about the desire of the voters and so brings up the decision made in California. To that (S2) says that he cannot trust the intellectual honesty discourse of (S1) because of his flawed arguments. </line>

  <line>S1 believes that dead &quot; potential &quot; lives don't have &quot; real &quot; or &quot; actual &quot; dead bodies . When a pre-birth child dies ( either naturally or by the hands of a ' doctor ' paid to kill it ) , ... it has a ' real ' body . S1 states willingness to debate the matter further with S2. S1 questions is Maine's voting results will overturn the 9th amendment. California's ban ( being reviewed by the 9th ) is likewise about &quot; the voters &quot; and their desired definition . S1 anticipates the responses of S2 and questions S2's ability to learn from the debate.</line>
  <line> </line>
  <line> </line>
  <line> S2 dislikes that S1 brought up abortion rights in the forum and thinks that S1 would lose abortion arguments by the arguments you have raised here . S2 believes that S1  flubbed up stating what you wanted to say trying to argue that the abortionists could have no qualms exterminating Jews in another Holocaust . It could  could just as easily argue that those people who wanted to prevent gay marriage could just as easily want to prevent inter-religious or inter-racial marriage. They could supposedly just as easily have wanted slavery back , if they're willing to deny people rights because of their differences. Maine's results were about how voters feel about gay marriage not about the federal constitution.  Bowers rationale does not withstand careful analysis . In his dissenting opinion in Bowers Justice Stevens concluded that ( 1 ) the fact a State s governing majority has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice , and ( 2 ) individual decisions concerning the intimacies of physical relationships , even when not intended to produce offspring , are a form of liberty protected by due process . LAWRENCE V. TEXAS The fact that a majority want a law is not enough to satisfy a constitutional challenge of that law .</line>

  <line>S1 says when a pre-birth child dies it has a &quot;real&quot; body. S2 thinks that S1 is trying to get people to talk to him about abortion. He tells S1 to couple a &quot;general welfare&quot; claim with the research that shows abortion has caused lower crime. S2 believes that boundaries do exist and he could easily argue that those people who wanted to prevent gay marriage could just as easily want to prevent inter-religious or inter-racial marriage. S1 poses a question if Maine's results have any bearing on the scotus look at overturning the 9th.  S2 says Maine's results were about how voters feel about gay marriage and the &quot;9th&quot; is about how federal constitution applies to gay marriage. S2 argues that they are two entirely different issues and the S1 pointing to issue A does not refute issue B. S2 believes it doesn't matter how much &quot;desire&quot; the voters have, their law still has to be constitutional and meet the requirements of the 14th amendment. He ends the discussion with S1 until S1 can embrace an honestly open discussion on the topic.</line>
