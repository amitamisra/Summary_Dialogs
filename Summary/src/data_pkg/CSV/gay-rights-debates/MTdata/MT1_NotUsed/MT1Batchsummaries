S1 thinks that acceptance of gays and recent natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes are all signs of the end of the world. He also asks if gays should be able to marry, then why not polygamists, since they aren't really harming anyone either. S2 says that floods and earthquakes have nothing to do with what people do or don't believe or any supernatural being, they are just natural occurrences that have always and will always happen. He agrees that voluntary polygamy should be legalized, though issues such as child support and inheritance would have to be carefully monitored.

The first writer is refuting the second writer's assertions that natural disasters have increased as foretold in the bible. He mocks these views as silly and irrelevant, and questions why God would allow his children to suffer in the first place.

The second writer continues to argue the point and tries to explain how God raises his children how he thinks is best.  The remaining conversation is an exchange of opinions about gay marriage and polygamy, and what the constitution means for minorities. The writers cannot agree on what causes homosexuality or why it should be treated differently from polygamy.

The argument begins and the topic is abortion and how the views of the bible are not valid as a reason for its legal status. The speaker then discusses the constitution and the interactions between majority rule and minority groups. The speakers belief is that the majority is better off by listening to the minority. The argument then reverts back to the authenticity of the bible in describing natural phenomena in the world such as earthquakes and other natural disasters. The speakers do not come to a common understanding or common ground and continue to indicate that they refute points.

In this dialogue, two people are discussing the validity of god. S1 rejects the bibl's prophecizing of wars and natural disasters, and states that the majority has the power to change the constitution. S2 claims certain disasters have been increasing. S1 asserts that connecting such events with groups and behaviors which Christianity has conflict with is not rational; and also asserts that a god who would punish in such a way is not worthy of worship. S2 makes god analogous to a parent disciplining their children. S1 refutes S2, and they being to tangentially discuss opinions on polygamy.

A heated morality argument discussing the nature of God, government policy changing due to what the majority wants, homosexuality, and abortion.  Subject 1 is Atheist while Subject 2 believes in God.  the primary issue debated is that Subject 1 is claiming that if there is a god, how can he punish a particular group such as homosexuals with AIDs while ignoring Africa, which suffers from AIDs and famine?  Subject 2 has a problem with Subject 1 making statements on the nature of God when Subject 1 does not believe in God to begin with.

So why draw the line at homosexuals ? Why not polygamists ? Why do homosexuals deserve the right and polygamists don't ? What merits do homosexuality bring that polygamy doesn't ? S 1 : 4 - So that little peice of geological trivia was just that , and had nothing to do with this debate or any points whatsoever ? Perhaps some people are capable of thinking from another's point of view , if God is a loving parent I can't see how you can justify the view that anything lethal can be used as a punishment . I don't think you know how genetics works in this instance . Or do you think that the method of upbringing they have is purely responisble ? I don't really see any real problem with polygamy itself , but it would have to be watched a little more carefully perhaps as the cultures that practise polygamy tend to be less focused on equality between sexs . As long as you make sure that the marriages are still volentary for both partners and that any person is fully able to leave if they want to then I can't really see the problem . However it is a lot more complicated if you are looking from the benefits point of view with respect to inheritance and other aspects ( child support and suchlike ) but these are realitively minor points that would just have to be worked out if this type of marriage was to be recognised

Using religion as a reason that homosexuality is intrinsically wrong is a poor argument. The Bible is full of contradictions and not everyone believes in its authority. Furthermore, the Bible was written by men, so trying to extrapolate what is in the Bible as "God's word" is inherently inaccurate and prone to misinterpretation. No one can really know what God believes or says, so biblical justification for anti-homosexual actions is not appropriate. Even if you use the Bible as justification against gays, people should also be adamantly against polygamy, adultery, and divorce.

Speaker 1 states that gays living together should not expect healthcare since they cannot marry.  Speaker 2 responds that “that’s just the way it is” is not a valid argument and states that the other speaker does not care that some people have rights while others are not entitles to them. Speaker one says that no one of the same sex can marry no matter straight or gay. Both speakers compare gay marriage to other civil right movements like the right to vote for women and interracial marriage. Speaker 1 states that gays don’t have the same struggles.

Healthcare and how it should be applied is being argued. In essence, it is being argued whether gay people should be given healthcare benefits. There seems to be an issue of this kind and many others relate to segregation. One believes that the obstacles can be overcome while the other believes that Gays have already lost the fight on legal grounds. This relates to the history of how people have been wronged in the past with examples of slavery and interracial marriage. Women are part of the conversation and they are the new example of unfair treatment. There is an emphasis on free speech and unalienable right that gays don’t have in comparison to their counterparts. This is wrong and Jefferson is used as an example.

The first writer states gays rightly cannot expect to extend health care to their partners since they are not married, just like unmarried straight couples.

The second writer thinks this is a ridiculous claim because gay couples do not have the option of marrying while straight couples do, at which point the first writer says it is a valid claim because everyone in the US has the right to marry someone of the opposite sex.

The second writer then says gays will overcome and gay marriage will be legalized, comparing it to slavery and women's rights issues. The first writer then disagrees.

S1 says that gays have exactly the same rights as everyone else, so the situation is not comparable to other human right's struggles such as the civil and women's rights movements, gives cases of states that have outlawed gay marriage and suggests that if gays want healthcare they should marry a person of the opposite sex to get it. S2 replies that gays can't really enter into an opposite sex marriage because they don't love someone of the opposite sex, and feels that gays will ultimately win the right to equal rights, marriage and healthcare much like interracial couples did.

In America, marriage or descendence is typically required to share health benefits. On one side there are claims that gays have the same right to marriage as straights.  That is, they can marry a member of the opposite sex.  On the other side, this means that gays are denied the right to marry who they want and thus are denied health care among other benefits of marriage.  Some would compare the issue to slavery, women's suffrage or even interracial marriage but are they really comparable?  The original Constitution condoned slavery and specifically defined citizens (voters) as men.

Comparing the Civil Rights Movement to gay rights is not intellectually honest. S1 implies that people are not born gay, but choose the lifestyle. Race, though, is something you cannot control as you are born black or white or Asian. In fact, major civil rights leaders are not in favor of equating gay rights with civil rights.

Dialog 3 involves the comparison between the struggle for gay marriage and the struggle for civil rights.  Speaker one contends that they are completely different.  He finds this issue insulting to all African Americans and then implies that most civil rights leaders are not in favor of homosexual marriage.  Speaker 2 argues that civil rights leaders support gay marriage.  Speaker 2 then provides links to articles about their positions on the issue. Speaker 1 then implies that Martin Luther King would be against gay marriage.  Speaker one opines that we will never know either way.

S1 thinks that all gay people are like those he believes were in San Francisco bathhouse in the 1980's - having unprotected sex with multiple partners, anonymous orgies, unconcerned with the spread of sexualy transmitted diseases and generally immoral. He points out that some people are trying to get such bathhouses reopened in spite of the public health concern. S2 points out that these people, if they even exist, are a small, isolated group of individuals that have nothing to do with gay marriage, gay rights or the greater population of homosexuals that do not participate in such things.

It appears the main issue here concerns the re-opening of Gay Bathhouses in California, It is hard to summarize this as both 'Common Law and Morality' and mixed here, So if one abandons dialog and cuts to the gist of the matter its plain that bathhouses has existed since millennium but basic human behavior and reaction plus social outlook has somewhat now changed in the intervening years, It would seem to the impartial reader that the 'Public Health' authorities would be best put to resolve these complicated issues due to both public exposure and to the issues of pathogenic exposure?,.

This is two people arguing over Bath Houses in San Francisco and comparing it to Sodom in the bible. One feels his research is not very good regarding the Bath Houses in San Fransisco and how they are just not true or accurate. The other party feels that searching on the internet is sufficient enough for him to believe that they did and still so exist. The conversation was apparently supposed the be about gay rights and somehow took a turn to attacking a small group of people that MAY have been involved in bath houses in the SF area.

S2 challenges S1 to prove claim and again calls him a homophobe for making accusations without proof.  S1 says this is why they closed these bathhouses down in 1980s.  S2 Says 1980s are not relevant.  S1 says gays want the bathhouses reopened.  S2 says this has nothing to do with gay rights and it's irresponsible to equate this with all gays.

He cites a rumor he has heard about gay men having unprotected group sex in bath houses in San Francisco as evidence of how disgusting homosexuals are as a whole.

The second writer is outraged by his homophobia, and demands he produce evidence or take back his comments. He says this is just a stereotype and does not represent all gay people.  He then expresses that it has nothing to do with the topic at hand and is irrelevant.

S1 feels that people are currently equally divided on the issue of gay marriage, but becoming increasingly accepting as time goes on, so even if current votes fail or are delayed by politicians fearing losing their reelection campaign, gay marriage will surely be legalized in the future. S2 feels that the majority opposes gay marriage and most of the support for it comes from youth, who will become more conservative. He thinks this is why gay marriage supporters prefer to fight in court, so they can get a liberal judge to interpret the law in their favor without a vote.

In this dialogue, two people discuss marriage between gay people. S1 claims that in Australia the majority of citizens do not support marriage between gay people. S2 implies agreement with this notion, and suggests that Australia is more evenly split on the issue, but that in the US gay people are not as likely to demand that the be voted on. S1 asserts that young people are in support of marriage equality, thus eventually, it will be nationally accepted. S2 retorts that people become more conservative as they age. S1 and S2 then disagree over this statement.

Using the courts is one avenue of getting equal rights for gays around the world. In fact, using the courts can bypass the political process and litigants can choose the venue in the hopes of finding a sympathetic judge.
