S 1 : 2 - They're not legally recognized because they don't meet the legal criteria for marriage , ie one man , one woman . A cat doesn't meet the legal definition of a dog . Do we change the definition of dog to appease the cat ? That's the real question to be answered by society .

That's not to say that we shouldn't consider the possibility of allowing gay unions with , possibly , equivalent rights to hetero couples if we , as a society , see the benefit in doing so . For example , prior to FDR , the concept of state welfare was considered ludicrous and unconstitutional , but he was able to get enough support ( and enough political muscle ) to change society's mind on the role of the Federal gov't once he demonstrated the " good " that doing so had on America in its most dire time of need . People were willing to sacrifice a little freedom for security just as Ben Franklin had warned against . Now , I'll be the first to tell you that I think FDR was the biggest threat to American freedom that ever existed , but one can't argue his ability to change public opinion on the role of the Federal gov't .

He does, however, recognize that if there were a good reason to allow it, there could be gay civil unions with similar legal rights to marriage, but fears that 500,000 gays would rush to enter into such unions. S2 states that if marriage is just a legal definition then there is no reason it can't be redefined to allow gay marriage and that a marriage rush would not be a problem.<p><b>Summary1_WordCount</p></b>102<p><b>Dialog1_WordCount</p></b>461<p><b>key2</p></b>1-2583_199_195__201_202_207_212_215_233_234_235_2<p><b>Dialog2</p></b>S 1 : 1 - So the CDC's distinction of males having sex with males doesn't mean that they're gay ? Minimally , they're bisexual . And , if you recall , we were talking about male children , as in " my son " . No , the CDC statistics show that the risk of women getting HIV from hetero males is small , unless they're drug addicts . You're attempting to make a distinction without a difference .

There are lots of things that I can do to decrease the risks associated with an inherently dangerous practice , but none of them are as " safe " as abstention . Sorry . S 2 : 1 - It's still a young disease , give it some more time ... Women Women make up nearly one-third of new HIV infections . 4 In 1992 , women accounted for 13.8% of people living with AIDS 5 ; by the end of 2001 that percentage had increased to 21% . 6 Among women , sexual contact accounts for 75% of infections . 7 http://www.cdcnpin.org/scripts/hiv/hiv.asp#women Percentage with HIV who are women in North America increases from 20% in 2001 to 25% in 2003 ... http://www.unaids.org/bangkok2004/GA....htm#TopOfPage S 1 : 2 - I've seen the facts on women . I believe that you are attempting to deflect the issue , however . If you dig a bit deeper , you find that women contracting HIV are doing so predominantly by having sex with bisexual men , having sex with heterosexual junkies with HIV and sharing needles with HIV infected people . It can't be argued that it's a mainstream " straight " disease by any stretch of the imagination . S 2 : 2 - It's being spread by men having sex with women . None of your data disproves that fact . S 1 :3 - Usually by men who acquired HIV from having sex with other men , that is . You like to omit salient facts in your argument . S 2 :3 - You should take off the blinders and learn to read more carefully . Your data only said they MAY contact it from a man who had sex with another man . Even if it were usually from men who first aquired it from other men , it is still being spread by men having sex with women . I am not omitting anything . You are looking for a scapegoat so relations between men and women won't be held responsible for the diseases they spread from that activity . It's similar to Mary getting a disease from a parnter John , and John and Mary blaming the person and the activity which gave him the disease , saying that he Mary and their activity isn't really to blame , just because they contracted the disease from John and Mary's activity . They had no need to use a condom , and it's not John or Mary's fault for not involving a condom in their activity . S 1 : 4 - If you want to find the source of a leak , you don't look at the end of the pipe , do you ? Wouldn't you trace the pipe back to its origin ? The origin of women with HIV is typically from having sex with a man with HIV who acquired it by having sex with a man with HIV who got it by having sex with a man with HIV ... etc. , etc. , Now , I agree that due to all of the bisexuals and MSMs out there who have spread the disease to women today , even having heterosexual relations isn't safe . But the widespread propagation of HIV took place in the gay community , not straight America . Straight America has acquired HIV tangentially to the main cause , either through transfers of blood from needles or via sex with a high risk partner , namely drug addict or MSM . S 2 : 4 - We do not know where the original leak of HIV started . Yes , it's easy for you to scapegoat a certain group you don't like , when you don't know where that original leak was , as I said above . The CDC also cites women having sex with an already infected partner or men with unspecified risks , as risky for women . It's not just MSM . S 1 : 5 - Agreed . But the floodgates opened up in the gay community . When did I EVER use the term " always " or " exclusively " ? I've used the word predominantly a few times , however . Do you dispute that ? S 2 : 5 - A victim of a disease is a victim of a disease . That is very subjective to say " floodgates " opened with a certain group . If the " floodgates " had opened with heterosexuals as could be said of Africa , would that have made any difference ? If one group instead of another has more cases of the disease , or had more at the beginning , does that make any difference ? It's a virus that continues to spread among all groups of people . You are saying one particular group which gets the disease , has made a bad choice , simply because it chooses to express it's sexuality . I haven't seen anything which states the most predominant higher risk area ( for women ) , exclusively , involves a woman partnering with an MSM .<p><b>Summary2</p></b>S1 thinks that gay men are the root of the AIDS epidemic, and that most, if not all, AIDS infections in other populations, if traced to their source, would lead back to homosexual activity between men. S2 points out that AIDS is still a new disease and it is increasing in other populations, such as women in heterosexual relationships. He thinks the gay community is a scapegoat for the spread of AIDS because people do not want to take responsibility for their behavior and regardless of which group had the most infections years ago, AIDS is currently a global problem.<p><b>Summary2_WordCount</p></b>102<p><b>Dialog2_WordCount</p></b>878<p><b>key3</p></b>1-1281_466_275__483_561_576_625_633_1<p><b>Dialog3</p></b>S 1 : 1 - Give us a break , the bibe saying ' in the future there will be Wars ... and Earthquakes !

I don't really see any real problem with polygamy itself , but it would have to be watched a little more carefully perhaps as the cultures that practise polygamy tend to be less focused on equality between sexs .

He also asks if gays should be able to marry, then why not polygamists, since they aren't really harming anyone either.

The speaker's main argument is that the term gay marriage is an oxymoron and thus is a circular argument. The speaker ends his side of the argument by establishing his views as anti-federal government by illustrating his dislike for the social welfare policies of FDR. Speaker 2 then asks for clarification of logical points.<p><b>Summary1_WordCount</p></b>99<p><b>Dialog1_WordCount</p></b>461<p><b>key2</p></b>1-2583_199_195__201_202_207_212_215_233_234_235_2<p><b>Dialog2</p></b>S 1 : 1 - So the CDC's distinction of males having sex with males doesn't mean that they're gay ? Minimally , they're bisexual . And , if you recall , we were talking about male children , as in " my son " . No , the CDC statistics show that the risk of women getting HIV from hetero males is small , unless they're drug addicts . You're attempting to make a distinction without a difference . Are you claiming that MSM aren't gay ? They certainly aren't heterosexuals . The only time I would think that occurs is in prison . There are lots of things that I can do to decrease the risks associated with an inherently dangerous practice , but none of them are as " safe " as abstention . Sorry . S 2 : 1 - It's still a young disease , give it some more time ... Women Women make up nearly one-third of new HIV infections . 4 In 1992 , women accounted for 13.8% of people living with AIDS 5 ; by the end of 2001 that percentage had increased to 21% . 6 Among women , sexual contact accounts for 75% of infections . 7 http://www.cdcnpin.org/scripts/hiv/hiv.asp#women Percentage with HIV who are women in North America increases from 20% in 2001 to 25% in 2003 ... http://www.unaids.org/bangkok2004/GA....htm#TopOfPage S 1 : 2 - I've seen the facts on women . I believe that you are attempting to deflect the issue , however . If you dig a bit deeper , you find that women contracting HIV are doing so predominantly by having sex with bisexual men , having sex with heterosexual junkies with HIV and sharing needles with HIV infected people . It can't be argued that it's a mainstream " straight " disease by any stretch of the imagination . S 2 : 2 - It's being spread by men having sex with women . None of your data disproves that fact . S 1 :3 - Usually by men who acquired HIV from having sex with other men , that is . You like to omit salient facts in your argument . S 2 :3 - You should take off the blinders and learn to read more carefully . Your data only said they MAY contact it from a man who had sex with another man . Even if it were usually from men who first aquired it from other men , it is still being spread by men having sex with women . I am not omitting anything . You are looking for a scapegoat so relations between men and women won't be held responsible for the diseases they spread from that activity . It's similar to Mary getting a disease from a parnter John , and John and Mary blaming the person and the activity which gave him the disease , saying that he Mary and their activity isn't really to blame , just because they contracted the disease from John and Mary's activity . They had no need to use a condom , and it's not John or Mary's fault for not involving a condom in their activity . S 1 : 4 - If you want to find the source of a leak , you don't look at the end of the pipe , do you ? Wouldn't you trace the pipe back to its origin ? The origin of women with HIV is typically from having sex with a man with HIV who acquired it by having sex with a man with HIV who got it by having sex with a man with HIV ... etc. , etc. , Now , I agree that due to all of the bisexuals and MSMs out there who have spread the disease to women today , even having heterosexual relations isn't safe . But the widespread propagation of HIV took place in the gay community , not straight America . Straight America has acquired HIV tangentially to the main cause , either through transfers of blood from needles or via sex with a high risk partner , namely drug addict or MSM . S 2 : 4 - We do not know where the original leak of HIV started . Yes , it's easy for you to scapegoat a certain group you don't like , when you don't know where that original leak was , as I said above . The CDC also cites women having sex with an already infected partner or men with unspecified risks , as risky for women . It's not just MSM . S 1 : 5 - Agreed . But the floodgates opened up in the gay community . When did I EVER use the term " always " or " exclusively " ? I've used the word predominantly a few times , however . Do you dispute that ? S 2 : 5 - A victim of a disease is a victim of a disease . That is very subjective to say " floodgates " opened with a certain group . If the " floodgates " had opened with heterosexuals as could be said of Africa , would that have made any difference ? If one group instead of another has more cases of the disease , or had more at the beginning , does that make any difference ? It's a virus that continues to spread among all groups of people . You are saying one particular group which gets the disease , has made a bad choice , simply because it chooses to express it's sexuality . I haven't seen anything which states the most predominant higher risk area ( for women ) , exclusively , involves a woman partnering with an MSM .<p><b>Summary2</p></b>The argument between the two speakers discussing the association of HIV and Aids with sexual orientation. The two further argue the causation and correlation of the data. For example, the speaker argues that women contract HIV through bisexual males who have had sexual contact with other men. The speaker against gay marriage concedes that any sex, even between male and female, is unsafe. The two begin to evaluate how important it is to understand the origination of the disease. The argument ends with Speaker 2 stating that the disease is simply a disease and it doesn't matter who is affected.<p><b>Summary2_WordCount</p></b>100<p><b>Dialog2_WordCount</p></b>878<p><b>key3</p></b>1-1281_466_275__483_561_576_625_633_1<p><b>Dialog3</p></b>S 1 : 1 - Give us a break , the bibe saying ' in the future there will be Wars ... and Earthquakes !

You implied that the Earthquakes were not a natural thing and dinviinly caused Even if there is a god , any ' loving parent ' that kills some of its children to make a point , when they are fully capable of just changing the issue anyway is hardly deserving of worship . As for people changing , not only is that dubious anyway but not really proof of anything , there are alcoholics who recover and don't drink and that is definitely genetically influenced . You clearly have no real idea about the state of genetic research or how it works , we are nowhere near finding the purpose of everything . There doesn't appear to be one gene , but there is probably a combination that lead to a greater chance of being gay . @ Rev , Power of Attorney would be fine , but giving that there is already favouritism shown to some people , why should that favouritism be arteficailly restricted . In the interest of fairness it seems a lot easy to recognise a few more people in an existing group that abolishing it .

For someoen that claims there is no God it's amazing how you're the expert now on the nature of God . i agree there is a disposition but that doesn't mean that they are genetically confined as the alcoholic isn't . So why draw the line at homosexuals ? Why not polygamists ? Why do homosexuals deserve the right and polygamists don't ? What merits do homosexuality bring that polygamy doesn't ? S 1 : 4 - So that little peice of geological trivia was just that , and had nothing to do with this debate or any points whatsoever ? Perhaps some people are capable of thinking from another's point of view , if God is a loving parent I can't see how you can justify the view that anything lethal can be used as a punishment . I don't think you know how genetics works in this instance . Or do you think that the method of upbringing they have is purely responisble ? I don't really see any real problem with polygamy itself , but it would have to be watched a little more carefully perhaps as the cultures that practise polygamy tend to be less focused on equality between sexs . As long as you make sure that the marriages are still volentary for both partners and that any person is fully able to leave if they want to then I can't really see the problem . However it is a lot more complicated if you are looking from the benefits point of view with respect to inheritance and other aspects ( child support and suchlike ) but these are realitively minor points that would just have to be worked out if this type of marriage was to be recognised<p><b>Summary3</p></b>The argument begins and the topic is abortion and how the views of the bible are not valid as a reason for its legal status. The speaker then discusses the constitution and the interactions between majority rule and minority groups. The speakers belief is that the majority is better off by listening to the minority. The argument then reverts back to the authenticity of the bible in describing natural phenomena in the world such as earthquakes and other natural disasters. The speakers do not come to a common understanding or common ground and continue to indicate that they refute points.<p><b>Summary3_WordCount</p></b>100<p><b>Dialog3_WordCount</p></b>933<p><b>HITId</p></b>3RWO3EJELHG00SMGBJIPIRDJ995P1W<p><b>worker_id</p></b>A3O3NBBS790FO7<p><b>key1</p></b>1-2583_34_32__51_56_62_65_1<p><b>Dialog1</p></b>S 1 : 1 - Agreed , when the husband is part of a hetero relationship .

What is the reason it's not legally recognized ? Because the couple is gay . Where do you get the figure of 500,000 gay couples who want to immediately be married ? Would these gay couples beat the straight couples in some kind of a race to the weddings occurring at the same time , or occurring over the course of a month or a year ? S 1 : 2 - They're not legally recognized because they don't meet the legal criteria for marriage , ie one man , one woman . A cat doesn't meet the legal definition of a dog .

To me , and I'm guessing millions of others , the term gay marriage is an oxymoron . That's not to say that we shouldn't consider the possibility of allowing gay unions with , possibly , equivalent rights to hetero couples if we , as a society , see the benefit in doing so . For example , prior to FDR , the concept of state welfare was considered ludicrous and unconstitutional , but he was able to get enough support ( and enough political muscle ) to change society's mind on the role of the Federal gov't once he demonstrated the " good " that doing so had on America in its most dire time of need . People were willing to sacrifice a little freedom for security just as Ben Franklin had warned against . Now , I'll be the first to tell you that I think FDR was the biggest threat to American freedom that ever existed , but one can't argue his ability to change public opinion on the role of the Federal gov't .

What are the logical reasons for marriage discrimination against gays and lesbians ?<p><b>Summary1</p></b>In this dialogue, two people are discussing marriage as it relates to gay people and straight people, respectively. The S1 suggests that the words "wife" and "husband" do not fit within the confines of any gay relationship, because it does meet the definition of marriage. The S2 claims that this is false logic since such ideology asserts marriage can only be between a man and a woman. The S1 then confirms that marriage should not be redefined to include gay people, but suggests gay people could have their own form of union with equitable rights to those of married people.<p><b>Summary1_WordCount</p></b>107<p><b>Dialog1_WordCount</p></b>461<p><b>key2</p></b>1-2583_199_195__201_202_207_212_215_233_234_235_2<p><b>Dialog2</p></b>S 1 : 1 - So the CDC's distinction of males having sex with males doesn't mean that they're gay ?

They don't fully disagree on the topic but have some disparities such as what makes marriage an actual marriage?  Their problem with the term "gay marriage" is that marriage is defined as a legal union between a heterosexual man and heterosexual woman.  So by making gay marriage legal, it negates the original definition of marriage.  The subjects agree that gay couples can be united by another recognized legal term, such as a civil union, if society does not have a problem with the issue.<p><b>Summary1_WordCount</p></b>97<p><b>Dialog1_WordCount</p></b>461<p><b>key2</p></b>1-2583_199_195__201_202_207_212_215_233_234_235_2<p><b>Dialog2</p></b>S 1 : 1 - So the CDC's distinction of males having sex with males doesn't mean that they're gay ?

Yes , it's easy for you to scapegoat a certain group you don't like , when you don't know where that original leak was , as I said above .

But the floodgates opened up in the gay community . When did I EVER use the term " always " or " exclusively " ? I've used the word predominantly a few times , however . Do you dispute that ? S 2 : 5 - A victim of a disease is a victim of a disease . That is very subjective to say " floodgates " opened with a certain group . If the " floodgates " had opened with heterosexuals as could be said of Africa , would that have made any difference ? If one group instead of another has more cases of the disease , or had more at the beginning , does that make any difference ? It's a virus that continues to spread among all groups of people . You are saying one particular group which gets the disease , has made a bad choice , simply because it chooses to express it's sexuality . I haven't seen anything which states the most predominant higher risk area ( for women ) , exclusively , involves a woman partnering with an MSM .<p><b>Summary2</p></b>Subjects are debating the blameworthiness of HIV between different groups.  Subject 1 believes that homosexual males are the main group to be blamed.  Subject 2 refutes this by claiming that as HIV is a young disease, over time the number of heterosexual females infected with HIV from a heterosexual male will rise.  They then state that just because Subject 1 does not like a particular group, does not mean they should blame them for a disease.  Much of the argument also revolves around the idea that bisexual men can be blamed for giving women HIV.<p><b>Summary2_WordCount</p></b>95<p><b>Dialog2_WordCount</p></b>878<p><b>key3</p></b>1-1281_466_275__483_561_576_625_633_1<p><b>Dialog3</p></b>S 1 : 1 - Give us a break , the bibe saying ' in the future there will be Wars ... and Earthquakes !

Agreed , when the spouse is part of a hetero relationship . Gay spouse is not a legally recognized category . S 2 : 1 - So the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem . What is the reason it's not legally recognized ? Because the couple is gay . Where do you get the figure of 500,000 gay couples who want to immediately be married ? Would these gay couples beat the straight couples in some kind of a race to the weddings occurring at the same time , or occurring over the course of a month or a year ? S 1 : 2 - They're not legally recognized because they don't meet the legal criteria for marriage , ie one man , one woman . A cat doesn't meet the legal definition of a dog . Do we change the definition of dog to appease the cat ? That's the real question to be answered by society . Actually , I pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only , but after reading the CBO report , I see that I wasn't far off . They predicted 600,000 gay couples would want to get married it allowed . S 2 : 2 - This is circular reasoning however . It's stating that marriage simply is heterosexual , and so completely ends debate . S 1 :3 - Exactly my point , just as a cat can never be considered a dog just because someone wants it to be . To me , and I'm guessing millions of others , the term gay marriage is an oxymoron . That's not to say that we shouldn't consider the possibility of allowing gay unions with , possibly , equivalent rights to hetero couples if we , as a society , see the benefit in doing so . For example , prior to FDR , the concept of state welfare was considered ludicrous and unconstitutional , but he was able to get enough support ( and enough political muscle ) to change society's mind on the role of the Federal gov't once he demonstrated the " good " that doing so had on America in its most dire time of need . People were willing to sacrifice a little freedom for security just as Ben Franklin had warned against . Now , I'll be the first to tell you that I think FDR was the biggest threat to American freedom that ever existed , but one can't argue his ability to change public opinion on the role of the Federal gov't .

But there options to assuage advocates of gay marriage, which is to grant equal rights to gay couples that straight couples have, which is known as gay unions. The phrase "gay marriage" is an oxymoron because historically marriage has always been between man and woman. semantically, marriage cannot be redefined because people want it to change, and the phrase has a constant meaning.<p><b>Summary1_WordCount</p></b>106<p><b>Dialog1_WordCount</p></b>461<p><b>key2</p></b>1-2583_199_195__201_202_207_212_215_233_234_235_2<p><b>Dialog2</p></b>S 1 : 1 - So the CDC's distinction of males having sex with males doesn't mean that they're gay ? Minimally , they're bisexual . And , if you recall , we were talking about male children , as in " my son " .

S 2 : 1 - It's still a young disease , give it some more time ... Women Women make up nearly one-third of new HIV infections . 4 In 1992 , women accounted for 13.8% of people living with AIDS 5 ; by the end of 2001 that percentage had increased to 21% . 6 Among women , sexual contact accounts for 75% of infections . 7 http://www.cdcnpin.org/scripts/hiv/hiv.asp#women Percentage with HIV who are women in North America increases from 20% in 2001 to 25% in 2003 ... http://www.unaids.org/bangkok2004/GA....htm#TopOfPage S 1 : 2 - I've seen the facts on women . I believe that you are attempting to deflect the issue , however . If you dig a bit deeper , you find that women contracting HIV are doing so predominantly by having sex with bisexual men , having sex with heterosexual junkies with HIV and sharing needles with HIV infected people .

Also, the concept of gay men being more susceptible to contracting HIV is not entirely accurate. Men who get HIV may get it from drug use. But gay men are definitely more suceptible to getting HIV than a heterosexual man because anal sex is more risky. With anal sex, tearing and bleeding may occur, which is the highest risk for contracting HIV. However, heterosexual couples also engage in anal sex and use of condoms can reduce this risk, so merely saying "gay's are more likely to get and pass on HIV" is only half of the truth.<p><b>Summary2_WordCount</p></b>121<p><b>Dialog2_WordCount</p></b>878<p><b>key3</p></b>1-1281_466_275__483_561_576_625_633_1<p><b>Dialog3</p></b>S 1 : 1 - Give us a break , the bibe saying ' in the future there will be Wars ... and Earthquakes !

No one can really know what God believes or says, so biblical justification for anti-homosexual actions is not appropriate.

S 1 : 2 - And the point is , in VA gays can't get married , therefore they can't share their gay lover's healthcare . Simple as that . Hopefully gay marriages will be outlawed everywhere so we don't have to continue to hear them bitch and moan about healthcare .

So , I take it you liked segregation , prohabition and prefer women barefoot in the kitchen rather than at the polls voting for anything . Wow ! all I an say is wow . S 1 : 2 - I'm guessing you mean " prohibition " . Gays don't have the right to shared healthcare because they're not married ! Gays have rights ... they can marry members of the opposite sex . Nobody can marry members of the opposite sex , it's not just gays . Gays have all the rights that straight people do . Straights can't marry people of the same sex , and neither can gays . If straigh people want heatlcare , they can marry someone of the opposite sex ... so can gays !

It is what they said about people flying , looking for a cure to polio , It is always darkest before the dawn ! S 1 : 4 - Looking at slavery is incorrect . Slavery was wrong because certain individuals who couldn't change their color were targeted and often tortured . They were treated as property and had no rights . HOWEVER , gays have the exact same rights as heterosexuals and are not property , nor can they be targeted by color , etc. Women voting is also a terrible example . That has to do with free speech , which is an unalienable right ( last time I checked , gays being allowed to marry wasn't an unalienable right ) . That was also when women couldn't hold jobs and had to work in the home . Gays don't have to do that . Interracial marriage goes along with slavery and is an absolutely terrible example . It was looked down upon , not illegal . Thomas Jefferson had children by a black woman .<p><b>Summary3</p></b>Speaker 1 states that gays living together should not expect healthcare since they cannot marry.  Speaker 2 responds that thats just the way it is is not a valid argument and states that the other speaker does not care that some people have rights while others are not entitles to them.

They are arguing if it is universal or it is how the environment influences the perception Christians have about gay marriage. The example used is that in Spain, evangelical Christians dont opposed gay marriage while in this country they do. They dont worry about the important things in this country and that is a problem. The one making such accusations is being accused of exaggerating the issue at hand and seems to lack credibility. There seems to be a shift in where the topic actually leads.<p><b>Summary1_WordCount</p></b>104<p><b>Dialog1_WordCount</p></b>229<p><b>key2</p></b>1-1875_13_11__14_16_31_39_1<p><b>Dialog2</p></b>S 1 : 1 - Healthcare usually applies to spouses .

If marriage is not legal in a state such as VA, there is no way it can apply in this situation. There is an other side to the equation where exceptions that may be made such as cohabitation or having children. There seems to be a disagreement about common law in this situation.

In essence, it is being argued whether gay people should be given healthcare benefits. There seems to be an issue of this kind and many others relate to segregation. One believes that the obstacles can be overcome while the other believes that Gays have already lost the fight on legal grounds. This relates to the history of how people have been wronged in the past with examples of slavery and interracial marriage. Women are part of the conversation and they are the new example of unfair treatment. There is an emphasis on free speech and unalienable right that gays dont have in comparison to their counterparts.

He expresses a wish for gays to leave VA and marriage to be outlawed everywhere in the US so he will not have to hear gays complaining about it anymore.

The second writer disagrees with him and says men can marry their girlfriends to extend them coverage or even live in a common law marriage, while gays do not have those options and thus it is unfair.<p><b>Summary2_WordCount</p></b>101<p><b>Dialog2_WordCount</p></b>214<p><b>key3</p></b>1-1875_21_20__22_24_25_27_30_2<p><b>Dialog3</p></b>S 1 : 1 - So , then 2 gays people living together in VA shouldn't expect healthcare , since a couple who isn't married doesn't get it .

The second writer thinks this is a ridiculous claim because gay couples do not have the option of marrying while straight couples do, at which point the first writer says it is a valid claim because everyone in the US has the right to marry someone of the opposite sex.

The second writer then says gays will overcome and gay marriage will be legalized, comparing it to slavery and women's rights issues.

The technique is similar to that being used to restrict abortion and pornography.

On one side there are claims that gays have the same right to marriage as straights.  That is, they can marry a member of the opposite sex.  On the other side, this means that gays are denied the right to marry who they want and thus are denied health care among other benefits of marriage.  Some would compare the issue to slavery, women's suffrage or even interracial marriage but are they really comparable?

We benefit from families with adopted children , step children , families with no children at all . No it does not . Prove it will come up , and also prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . Marriage is that now . You're right , it has nothing to do with the Bible . It has everything to do with the slippery slope logical fallacy , which we've discussed in the forum ad nauseum . It only shows that those opposed do not have an argument . You know the prospect of incest and polygamy is much less socially acceptable than gay marriage , so you try to erroneously tie polygamy and incest to gay marriage in people's mind to strike fear in them , and hope their logical reasoning can be replaced by irrational fear . S 2 : 1 - a married couple as the head of a home is considered a nuclear family it already has . the question of legality is what this whole issue is about . marriage is a legal instituation , how could legality NOT come up . yes it is whoa ... hold up ... are you saying that only because gay marriage is less unacceptable that incestuous relations , that its ok to grant gay marriage but not sibling marriage ?? if the incestuous society begin to parade and protest , until society accepts them on the level that they accept gays now , what will you say then ? on what grounds should we discriminate against 2 siblings wanting to get married , particularly if they believe they truly love each other , or if they believe that they were born with that attraction ? this is classic hypocracy . if 2 siblings want to love each other in their private lives , how is that any business of yours ? and what does irrational fear have to do with anything ? do you have an irrational fear of an incestuous or polygamous lifestyle ? based on what ? give me one reason why society shouldnt accept an incestuous relation between two consenting adults S 1 : 2 - Then what may lead to incest and polygamy is the fact that marriage is a legal institution , is that what you are saying ? If so , these things may come up equally as a result of straight legal marriage or gay legal marriage or interracial legal marriage , or legal inter-faith marriage or legal marriage with legal divorce , etc. It doesn't relate specifically to gay legal marriage at all . I was saying this is how many people attempt an argument against gay marriage , by attempting to incite fear by spouting off a parade of horribles that have nothing to do with the issue of gay marriage . What if straight people are married and winged green monkeys come flying out of everyone's derriere in the future ? What will you do then ? Demonstrate how gay marriage specifically relates to incest and incestuous marriage and polygamy . This is the gay rights forum , not the incest forum . S 2 : 2 - thats not what im saying . what may lead to incestuous marriage is if siblings or related people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . and what may lead to polygamous marriage is 3 or more people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . do you see a pattern here ? ooooh .. nice way to snake out of the issue ... let me refresh your memory since you brought it up , what exactly does the social acceptance of any type of " taboo " relationship have to do with their right to be legally married ? is there a certain limit of " tabooness " , and if youre past that limit then no marriage for you ? and what fear are you talking about ? i'm talking about people that love each other and want to tie the knot . how could that possibly strike fear in somebody ? please .... S 1 :3 - Yes , that's true . Yes , that's true . Are you saying love is the pattern ? Well , love applies to straight marriages as well as gay marriages . Love is not exclusive to gay marriages . If that's the connection , we can just as easily say straight marriage will lead to incestuous marriage and polygamy . You are saying love will cause a slippery slope . It's still fallacious . The issue I brought up was why this fallacy is often used , that is to create fear , because incest and polygamy are indeed considered so taboo . The issue is not the tabooness of anything and everything , but how it is being used to distract from the issue of same-sex marriage , when there isn't a logical , rational argument against same-sex marriage . It's an indication of desperation on the part of some of those who are against same-sex marriage . I have no reason to discuss the level of acceptability or lack thereof of every single thing , before I accept one thing that is different from all those other things . I can deal with that one thing on all of its own merits and shortfalls , without being drawn into a false dilemma , either accept everything or else don't accept one thing , as if those are the only two choices , fallacy . S 2 :3 - gay marriage will change the definition of marriage from " a legal union between a man and a woman " to " a legal union between any parties that love each other " . if its ok for 2 people that love each other and want to tie the knot , then how could incest be a taboo ? based on what ? again with the double standard . gay marriage was considered just as much a taboo as incest or polygamy just a few years ago . being gay emerged from its taboo status through parades , promotional efforts , and , unfortunately , by spreading lies ( i'll deal with that in another thread ) . however , incestuous people didnt go through the process of parading their lifestyle in front of the world and practically begging for approval from society . so incest is still deeper in taboo status than homosexuality . why is it ok to deny incestuous relations the right to marry on the grounds that it is considered taboo , but ok to approve gay marriage on the same grounds ?<p><b>Summary2</p></b>Dialog two states that it is basically at taboo for gay and incestuous people to get married. For years, it has been unnacceptable for either of these things to occur.

The percentage of people getting divorces who have been married over 5 years drops dramatically ........... S 2 : 1 - Um , young people and young marriages really aren't the same thing . There are those young people who actually do stay together past those first five years . The truth of the matter is that couples in general who divorce do so more often within the first five years , regardless of age . The point was and still is , that heterosexual marriages end in divorce nearly 50% of the time . End of story . You can try to pretty it up all you want , it doesn't change the fact that you heteros are no better at staying together than you expect us gays / lesbians to . S 1 : 2 - Of course there are but a lot of young people get married and realize it was a mistake and get divorced ............ S 2 : 2 - Yeah , so ? There are a lot of older people who get married and realize the same thing and get divorced ... all within the same five year time period . One does not really have a lot to do with the other . Nor does it change the fact that more than half of ALL marriages end in divorce . Period , end of story , no nit-picking ... { Just remember these marriages still only are consisted of HETEROSEXUALS ... } S 1 :3 - yes but because of the high rate of young people that get divorced it throws the percentage off ...... Statistics prove by a wide majority that gays in general are much more promiscuous then straights .........

If you throw out the lesbians it would be about 2 percent .......<p><b>Summary1</p></b>This is an argument against homosexual marriage. It discusses divorce rates that are already too high and the breakdown of the nuclear family.  Speaker one argues that once you move young marriages out of the statistics, divorce rates are well below 50%. Speaker two argues that people of all ages are getting divorced within the first five years of marriage.  These heterosexual couples divorce at a rate of over 50% and homosexual marriage could hardly do much to increase this rate.  Speaker one counters that homosexuals are more promiscuous and even more likely to divorce after marriage.<p><b>Summary1_WordCount</p></b>97<p><b>Dialog1_WordCount</p></b>461<p><b>key2</p></b>1-4350_46_31__54_59_66_69_1<p><b>Dialog2</p></b>S 1 : 1 - We don't just benefit from what is often considered the common , nuclear family . We benefit from families with adopted children , step children , families with no children at all . No it does not . Prove it will come up , and also prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . Marriage is that now . You're right , it has nothing to do with the Bible . It has everything to do with the slippery slope logical fallacy , which we've discussed in the forum ad nauseum . It only shows that those opposed do not have an argument . You know the prospect of incest and polygamy is much less socially acceptable than gay marriage , so you try to erroneously tie polygamy and incest to gay marriage in people's mind to strike fear in them , and hope their logical reasoning can be replaced by irrational fear . S 2 : 1 - a married couple as the head of a home is considered a nuclear family it already has . the question of legality is what this whole issue is about . marriage is a legal instituation , how could legality NOT come up . yes it is whoa ... hold up ... are you saying that only because gay marriage is less unacceptable that incestuous relations , that its ok to grant gay marriage but not sibling marriage ?? if the incestuous society begin to parade and protest , until society accepts them on the level that they accept gays now , what will you say then ? on what grounds should we discriminate against 2 siblings wanting to get married , particularly if they believe they truly love each other , or if they believe that they were born with that attraction ? this is classic hypocracy . if 2 siblings want to love each other in their private lives , how is that any business of yours ? and what does irrational fear have to do with anything ? do you have an irrational fear of an incestuous or polygamous lifestyle ? based on what ? give me one reason why society shouldnt accept an incestuous relation between two consenting adults S 1 : 2 - Then what may lead to incest and polygamy is the fact that marriage is a legal institution , is that what you are saying ? If so , these things may come up equally as a result of straight legal marriage or gay legal marriage or interracial legal marriage , or legal inter-faith marriage or legal marriage with legal divorce , etc. It doesn't relate specifically to gay legal marriage at all . I was saying this is how many people attempt an argument against gay marriage , by attempting to incite fear by spouting off a parade of horribles that have nothing to do with the issue of gay marriage . What if straight people are married and winged green monkeys come flying out of everyone's derriere in the future ? What will you do then ? Demonstrate how gay marriage specifically relates to incest and incestuous marriage and polygamy . This is the gay rights forum , not the incest forum . S 2 : 2 - thats not what im saying . what may lead to incestuous marriage is if siblings or related people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . and what may lead to polygamous marriage is 3 or more people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . do you see a pattern here ? ooooh .. nice way to snake out of the issue ... let me refresh your memory since you brought it up , what exactly does the social acceptance of any type of " taboo " relationship have to do with their right to be legally married ? is there a certain limit of " tabooness " , and if youre past that limit then no marriage for you ? and what fear are you talking about ? i'm talking about people that love each other and want to tie the knot . how could that possibly strike fear in somebody ? please .... S 1 :3 - Yes , that's true . Yes , that's true . Are you saying love is the pattern ? Well , love applies to straight marriages as well as gay marriages . Love is not exclusive to gay marriages . If that's the connection , we can just as easily say straight marriage will lead to incestuous marriage and polygamy . You are saying love will cause a slippery slope . It's still fallacious . The issue I brought up was why this fallacy is often used , that is to create fear , because incest and polygamy are indeed considered so taboo . The issue is not the tabooness of anything and everything , but how it is being used to distract from the issue of same-sex marriage , when there isn't a logical , rational argument against same-sex marriage . It's an indication of desperation on the part of some of those who are against same-sex marriage . I have no reason to discuss the level of acceptability or lack thereof of every single thing , before I accept one thing that is different from all those other things . I can deal with that one thing on all of its own merits and shortfalls , without being drawn into a false dilemma , either accept everything or else don't accept one thing , as if those are the only two choices , fallacy . S 2 :3 - gay marriage will change the definition of marriage from " a legal union between a man and a woman " to " a legal union between any parties that love each other " . if its ok for 2 people that love each other and want to tie the knot , then how could incest be a taboo ? based on what ? again with the double standard . gay marriage was considered just as much a taboo as incest or polygamy just a few years ago . being gay emerged from its taboo status through parades , promotional efforts , and , unfortunately , by spreading lies ( i'll deal with that in another thread ) . however , incestuous people didnt go through the process of parading their lifestyle in front of the world and practically begging for approval from society . so incest is still deeper in taboo status than homosexuality . why is it ok to deny incestuous relations the right to marry on the grounds that it is considered taboo , but ok to approve gay marriage on the same grounds ?<p><b>Summary2</p></b>This is an argument about homosexual marriage. Speaker 1 believes that homosexual marriage would increase both the breakdown of the tradition family and the institution of marriage.  It also sets a bad legal precedent for other forbidden relationships like polygamy and incest.  Speaker 2 believes that people in love should be allowed to get married and homosexual marriage will bring more stability to families.  He says the incest and polygamy are red herrings because both of these taboo relationships involve heterosexuals rather than homosexuals.  Speaker 1 believes if one is right than all should be allowed<p><b>Summary2_WordCount</p></b>96<p><b>Dialog2_WordCount</p></b>1056<p><b>key3</p></b>1-3124_9_8__11_12_15_16_19_25_1<p><b>Dialog3</p></b>S 1 : 1 - I will take this one ........

Granted after some thought and much consideration there is both right and wrong on both sides of both Homosexuality tho judging from the -GIST- of the stated article it is badly compared to the secondary issue of 'Gay Marriage', It would seem that the earlier writers are trying to reconcile the article whilst skipping the core essential fact that neither 
writer can reconcile the two separate issues of Homosexuality as expressed frankly there is no 'Acceptable' argument to justify either of the opposing points in 'Modern Society' as there are both glaring errors and truths also on both sides.<p><b>Summary1_WordCount</p></b>110<p><b>Dialog1_WordCount</p></b>393<p><b>key2</p></b>1-788_12_9__15_31_35_40_2<p><b>Dialog2</p></b>S 1 : 1 - It would lead ultimately down the road to a marriage bill for polygamists . That is why the current push for a Constitutional Amendment to ban gay marriage also contains a provision banning polygamous marriage as well . Hmm .... some opposition to the petition ... More left wing ideology at work . S 2 : 1 - If the man after God    s own heart had multiple wives , why can    t I ? :) I have heard others say that we already have polygamy in America . It    s called serial polygamy because of our liberal divorce laws . So now those that are opposed to even more laws on the books and a return to Old Testament practices are considered left wing ? What    s this world coming too ? LOL S 1 : 2 - King David having multiple wives was under Old Testament practice . Jesus himself stated that divorce laws were granted by Moses and allowed by God because of the hardness of the people hearts . Jesus said a man shall leave his father and mother and be cleaved to his WIFE , Not WIVES . BTW , its called serial MONOGAMY . If its ' right wing ' to support a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage than its ' left wing ' to oppose a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage . S 2 : 2 - So is it a sin or just a practice ? I don    t remember Jesus saying polygamy was wrong . The statement you referred to does indicate that he was talking about a single wife , but I wouldn    t base a whole social convention on one word out of a whole book . Anyway the Jews don    t believe in the New Testament . Would it be okay for them ? Man I screwed that one up . I    ll try to be a little more articulate in the future . :) Okay I was just wondering . I base my wing on what I think is correct , not left or right . A few years ago it was right wing to be against the deficit , now it seems to be left wing . But that just shows what I know about wings . LOL S 1 :3 - The idea that it is now left wing to be against deficits is absurd . Numerous Democrats actually wanted to spend more than the Bush Administrations 12.5% increase in federal spending . S 2 :3 - I was basing that on your previous statement In other words , anything that is opposed to one wing must be the opposite so I don    t see how it    s absurd unless you want to call your original statement absurd . This is obviously not the thread for this discussion but I will reply this time and see where it takes us . You didn    t state what you considered to be    numerous    nor did you supply anything to back up that statement . However deficits depend on both increased spending and lower revenues . Bush has done both with large tax cuts and large discretionary spending increases . And even the conservatives are beginning to criticize him for being a big spending president . Over the past 23 years ,    conservative    administrations have increased the deficits and    liberal    administrations have decreased the deficits .

The Constitution of the U.S. gives me this right to be opposed to it , just as it gives you the right to be for it .<p><b>Summary1</p></b>The first writer believes there is nothing wrong with gay marriage and expresses that a relationship between two men who are faithful to each other is better than one in which a man has a different wife for every day of the week, referring to polygamy.

The second writer disagrees. He questions how the first writer knows men with multiple wives aren't in loving and faithful relationships. He is against gay marriage and calls those who are against banning gay marriage heterophobes. He cites a poll of Americans as evidence both political ideologies are against gay marriage in the United States.<p><b>Summary1_WordCount</p></b>101<p><b>Dialog1_WordCount</p></b>393<p><b>key2</p></b>1-788_12_9__15_31_35_40_2<p><b>Dialog2</p></b>S 1 : 1 - It would lead ultimately down the road to a marriage bill for polygamists . That is why the current push for a Constitutional Amendment to ban gay marriage also contains a provision banning polygamous marriage as well . Hmm .... some opposition to the petition ... More left wing ideology at work . S 2 : 1 - If the man after God    s own heart had multiple wives , why can    t I ? :) I have heard others say that we already have polygamy in America . It    s called serial polygamy because of our liberal divorce laws . So now those that are opposed to even more laws on the books and a return to Old Testament practices are considered left wing ? What    s this world coming too ? LOL S 1 : 2 - King David having multiple wives was under Old Testament practice . Jesus himself stated that divorce laws were granted by Moses and allowed by God because of the hardness of the people hearts . Jesus said a man shall leave his father and mother and be cleaved to his WIFE , Not WIVES . BTW , its called serial MONOGAMY . If its ' right wing ' to support a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage than its ' left wing ' to oppose a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage . S 2 : 2 - So is it a sin or just a practice ? I don    t remember Jesus saying polygamy was wrong . The statement you referred to does indicate that he was talking about a single wife , but I wouldn    t base a whole social convention on one word out of a whole book . Anyway the Jews don    t believe in the New Testament . Would it be okay for them ? Man I screwed that one up . I    ll try to be a little more articulate in the future . :) Okay I was just wondering . I base my wing on what I think is correct , not left or right . A few years ago it was right wing to be against the deficit , now it seems to be left wing . But that just shows what I know about wings . LOL S 1 :3 - The idea that it is now left wing to be against deficits is absurd . Numerous Democrats actually wanted to spend more than the Bush Administrations 12.5% increase in federal spending . S 2 :3 - I was basing that on your previous statement In other words , anything that is opposed to one wing must be the opposite so I don    t see how it    s absurd unless you want to call your original statement absurd . This is obviously not the thread for this discussion but I will reply this time and see where it takes us . You didn    t state what you considered to be    numerous    nor did you supply anything to back up that statement . However deficits depend on both increased spending and lower revenues . Bush has done both with large tax cuts and large discretionary spending increases . And even the conservatives are beginning to criticize him for being a big spending president . Over the past 23 years ,    conservative    administrations have increased the deficits and    liberal    administrations have decreased the deficits . So yeah it looks to me like left wing is against deficits and right wing is for deficits .<p><b>Summary2</p></b>The first writer believes allowing gay marriage would be a slippery slope leading to the legalization of polygamy. He says the desire to allow either is a left wing ideology.

The second writer argues that polygamy was allowed in the bible, so he is not sure why Christians or the first writer are so opposed to it. He asserts that it is not left wing because it originates from religious practices.

The discussion then digresses into what exactly defines left wing or right wing ideologies. The writers discuss federal deficits and whether opposing these deficits is called a liberal or conservative ideology.<p><b>Summary2_WordCount</p></b>102<p><b>Dialog2_WordCount</p></b>552<p><b>key3</p></b>1-3134_11_10__12_13_14_28_43_47_60_62_1<p><b>Dialog3</p></b>S 1 : 1 - I think a better comparison is Sodom ..........

That is not homophobic , that is a fact and you should condemn it too ........... S 2 : 2 - So , you have been there to see this I take it or are you going on rumors and misinformation . Did you read about this on the focus on family website ? Sorry , I just don't believe you . S 1 :3 - Go to Yahoo and do a search on San Francisco Gay bath houses if you don't believe me ....... When the AIDS first came out they were shut down but they are flourishing again now and the occupants have gone back to unprotected sex ......... From what I have surmised you are gay . I am surprised you did not know that ..... S 2 :3 - YOu made a very specific claim about 100 men in a daisy chain having unprotected sex . It is clear to me that post was not based in fact , but opinion . If you don't have the proof of the claim , you shouldn't make it ! That is what makes you a homophobe . You make claims about gays without knowing the truth . S 1 : 4 - Why do you think they closed the bath houses down in the eighties ? S 2 : 4 - This , at last check is 2005 , what they did in the 80's has nothing to do with the topic at hand , or your comments . So either justify your comments or take them back and admit they were uncalled for ... S 1 : 5 - Joe you need to read the link I cited in a post in this thread ......... Gays in SF are trying to get the bath houses reopened ......... S 2 : 5 - Great ! What does that have to do with gay rights ? What does it have to do with the title of this thread ? How can you take what a small group of gays in California are doing and equate it to the behaviors of all gays . That is irresponsible .<p><b>Summary3</p></b>The first writer believes homosexuals and homosexual acts are deplorable, and compares them to the destruction of Sodom from the bible. He cites a rumor he has heard about gay men having unprotected group sex in bath houses in San Francisco as evidence of how disgusting homosexuals are as a whole.

The second writer is outraged by his homophobia, and demands he produce evidence or take back his comments. He says this is just a stereotype and does not represent all gay people.  He then expresses that it has nothing to do with the topic at hand and is irrelevant.<p><b>Summary3_WordCount</p></b>100<p><b>Dialog3_WordCount</p></b>407<p><b>HITId</p></b>3XDSWAMB22Z5N7XTRTMYZSMKI2JCQ1<p><b>worker_id</p></b>A1LZB1IN8UX3AH<p><b>key1</p></b>1-1281_13_12__20_22_27_30_34_36_40_2<p><b>Dialog1</p></b>S 1 : 1 - Should they ?

S1 claims that the behaviors are what should be treated unequally, and states only Christianity's practices are legal, which proves their justification.<p><b>Summary2_WordCount</p></b>105<p><b>Dialog2_WordCount</p></b>813<p><b>key3</p></b>1-1281_461_460__462_463_470_474_475_5<p><b>Dialog3</p></b>S 1 : 1 - I believe someone brought up the Australian situation , conserning a gay marriage ban .

S1 claims that in Australia the majority of citizens do not support marriage between gay people. S2 implies agreement with this notion, and suggests that Australia is more evenly split on the issue, but that in the US gay people are not as likely to demand that the be voted on. S1 asserts that young people are in support of marriage equality, thus eventually, it will be nationally accepted. S2 retorts that people become more conservative as they age. S1 and S2 then disagree over this statement.<p><b>Summary3_WordCount</p></b>103<p><b>Dialog3_WordCount</p></b>343<p><b>HITId</p></b>3XDSWAMB22Z5N7XTRTMYZSMKI2JCQ1<p><b>worker_id</p></b>A3TSHG5R492EHU<p><b>key1</p></b>1-1281_13_12__20_22_27_30_34_36_40_2<p><b>Dialog1</p></b>S 1 : 1 - Should they ? What are western standards ? What were they 20 yrs ago ? What were they 100 yrs ago ? Marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract . S 2 : 1 - Where would that put families started by artificial insemination ? S 1 : 2 - The same as any other heterosexual couple . It's not the way children are created ( adopted , serrogacy , etc ) . It ' s the nature of the relationship ( heterosexual ) . Natural refers to nature not child bearing . S 2 : 2 - which god enforces marriage rules when the cermony is performend by a judge ? There was a tribe in the Congo that allowed it . Their shamans told them that the warriors could only marry outer warriors . To be with a women , they thought , might make then softer , and more woman like , and not as fearless in combat . Ok , so conceiving a child is not what makes it nature , what is it ? Wouldn    t polygamy also include some of that same sex taboo , to women marred together ? Why do you feel your values are right and others that disagree as wrong ? S 1 :3 - Polygamy is not women married together . It's one man or women married to multiple of the opposite sex like a harem or entourage . Everyone feels their values are right or else they wouldn't believe in them . What we value shows . Of course atheist don't believe in God so they have a different set of values . I of course believe in God first , family second , and country third . If you have different values then of course you will think yours are better if not then you wouldn't have them . Our values are what guide us . I feel that from perspective my values give someone a better balance and stability to function in society . You probably think otherwise but I feel statistically I can support mine . S 2 :3 - Sorry , I don    t practice Polygamy ; I don    t know the inner workings of the family . I would think it would be a good way for bi-sexual to stay below the radar . I worded the question badly ; I should have asked why do you feel that your morals should be forced on to others ? By keeping the laws the way they are now it is discrimination . Correct me if I am wrong , but I did not think you could fire some one for being gay . S 1 : 4 - It's all good I didn't think you knew what you were talking about anyways ? The questions is why should they force their moral on us ? Should we let other people like nudist and rapist force their mroals on us ? S 2 : 4 - How is allowing them to marry    forcing there morals on us    ? Yes we would have to deal with the fact of it , but the US has been dealing with the fact of Polygamy fro years . There is only one case that was prosecuted in recent history ( that was mostly due to one of his    wives    being 14 when married . S 1 : 5 - When society legalizes behavior it is in fact accepting it as non-detrimental and accepting it . It is a form of forcing our society to accept the behavior .<p><b>Summary1</p></b>Marriage is a legal institution and can be defined by the populace and courts. Since it is a legal institution, it is not appropriate to equate gay marriage with a human right. Treating gays with respect is different from letting them marry, which is a legal definition and can be restricted to the historical definition of one man, one woman.<p><b>Summary1_WordCount</p></b>60<p><b>Dialog1_WordCount</p></b>555<p><b>key2</p></b>1-1281_206_203__227_238_259_278_467_3<p><b>Dialog2</p></b>S 1 : 1 - You're late . I didn't bring up religon in my argument . Jake did . So please don't specualte anything until you knwo what we're talking about . All laws are based upon morals . So it is based upon the morals of the country whcih happen to be predominantly Christian . England was one of many countries . There is no new family structure that didn't exist before this country . My definition of negative effect is that the puposes for which something is created is hindered or compromises . By changing standards there is a harm to it's integrity . Intregrity is compromised when it isn't stable . Soemthing that changes all teh time loses that integrity like John Kerry on his views . Things must remain consistent to be integral . This argument has a flaw . That when there is guaranteed religous freedomw then we dont ' have equal rights . Everyone has equal rights in terms of believing . However behavior is regualted by the government . Therefore we can do anyting in the name of religion until it violates behavior that is acceptable by society . S 2 : 1 - Fine , so what if the government said people are free to ' believe ' in God , but any sign of them putting their belief into practice , such as going to church or even just praying in private was illegal ? Would that be acceptable ? After all it is just regulating behaviourA , not belief ? Your comparisons are ludicrous . All of these situations involve non-consensual acts either through lack of knowledge or involvement of minors . You cannot compare that to consensual acts between adults . S 1 : 2 - That probably wouldn't be acceptable to most people but it would be legal and equal . They don't allow religious practices of polygamy , animal or human sacrifices , body mutilation , and many other religious practices . So then we should allow prostitution , polygamy , human trafficking , drug trafficking , gambling , drug distribution , and all other consensual acts . S 2 : 2 - But they obviously wouldn't be equal , because a significant proportion of the population would be restricted from worshipping how they want in a for that hurts nobody . These elements mostly have links to crime over and above the act itself , that justifies restrictions . Homosexuality doesn't . S 1 :3 - The poeple would be equal . The religions would not . Look at our country . Almost all Christian beleifs are legal and no other non-Christians Churches have almost all their legal beleifs . That's it ? Crime ? That's it . The criminal link ? So if they criminalized homosexuality then it would be okay to ban gay marriage . Homosexuality has links to crime too . Sodomy is a crime . Define harm becaue homosexuality is harmful according to many . S 2 :3 - This is not equality . You are using the letter of the law to twist the purpose of the law , and even then doing it using very shaky logic . Equality is about general concepts , not specifics . It is equality to say ' everyone is has the same right to worship who they want ' , it is not equality to say ' everyone has the same right to worship who we tell them to ' . That is equality within an unequal system , which cannot be counted . Can you re-phrase , I don't follow . No . As I said , those have strong links to criminal activity irrespective of the act itself being a crime . For example drug use has noted links to theft , the same just cannot be said for homosexuality . No it isn't . And even if it was , that has nothing to do with homosexuality anyway . Physical or psychological injury or damage . Homosexuality is therefore in no way harmful . And I have serous doubts about the ' many ' who say it is . S 1 : 4 - Equality is treating every person the same . However it does not mean treating every person's behavior the same . It does not mean treat every organization the same either . Everyone has the same rights . NOt every religous practice , ideology , or behavior get the same treatment . Teh people determine what is in the public's interest to protect and ban . It basically only the Christian practices that are completely legal . Islamic polgamy and other religons don't have their practices recognized as often as christianity . Homosexuality has strong links to sodomy . Also prostitution is legal in Nevada so shoudl all states be forced to allow taht behavior ? Insome states adults cann have sex wiht 14 - 16 yr olds in some cases . Should other states recognize that too ? Most serial killers of men and young boys were homosexuals . Sodomy is a crime do you wnat me to post it ? gynocologist , Gi specialists , and colon specialist have all stated the effects homosexual related activites . Also there is a higher risk of disease transmission among homosexual men so much so they are not allowed to donate blood for 5 yrs from their last activity .<p><b>Summary2</p></b>Using the Bible as a reason to discriminate against gays is wrong. In the US, some gay behavior is still illegal, which is wrong and outdated because these laws are based on biblical rationale.<p><b>Summary2_WordCount</p></b>34<p><b>Dialog2_WordCount</p></b>813<p><b>key3</p></b>1-1281_461_460__462_463_470_474_475_5<p><b>Dialog3</p></b>S 1 : 1 - I believe someone brought up the Australian situation , conserning a gay marriage ban .
