S1 argues that same sex marriage is not the same essential component to people's general welfare that one man and one woman is. This person believes that society can survive without homosexual unions, polygamy and bestiality, and that it would not survive long without heterosexual marriage. He or she argue that S2 is simply disagreeing on where the legal line should be drawn for marriage, and that government has the right to impose a legal distinction somewhere.
S2 argues that homosexual couples and families all have the same basic needs, responsibilities to one another and society as heterosexual people do. This person believes that S1 is wrong by rebutting the idea that society could also survive without allowing many minorities the same rights as the majority.

S1 claims that same-sex marriage is not the same essential component of society that opposite-sex marriage is. He clarifies by suggesting that society can function without same-sex marriage, but not without opposite-sex marriage, presumably due to the reproductive element involved. He redefines the argument to be whether the government has the right to decide which types of marriages it will recognize, suggesting that the debate is just about where the line is drawn.
S2 claims that same-sex and opposite-sex families have the same needs and responsibilities within society. He claims that S1 is correct that society could function without giving minorities the same rights as majority but that this is amoral, and that there is no good reason to deny people the right of same-sex marriage.

S1 thinks it doesn't matter if anyone is harmed by gay marriage it is different than the basic structure. He thinks society could not survive without heterosexual marriage but it can without gay marriage. He argues that the real issue is where to draw the lines on marriage laws. S2 argues that society could survive without many of the rights it has and that argument is really a way of discriminating against minorities, therefore it isn't an argument. S2 agrees the issue is where to draw the line but states you need reasons the line should be there and there isn't one for gay marriage.

S1 believes S2's statements exclude gay couples from the term marriage.  S1 feels the argument of society's survival is a way of saying it's alright to exclude a minority group from what is to be considered the social norm as homosexuals have been.

S2 believes whether or not gay marriage impacts the public's view of marriage, that society could survive without it whereas society could not survive as a whole without heterosexual unions. S2 supports his/her statements with the argument that most people agree the government has a right to draw a line where marriage is concerned as in polygamy, incest, statutory, so it could be said the only valid argument is not that of inequality but more of where the line should be drawn.

Two people are discussing the importance of gay marriage to society.  S1 states that gay marriage is not an essential component to the welfare of society.  He states that our society can survive without homosexual unions, polygamy and bestiality; without heterosexual marriage society would not survive long at all. S2 retorts that this is not an argument, as society could survive without giving many minorities the same rights as the majority. S1 states that the people through government has the right to draw the line on what is recognized as marriage, and the disagreement is to where that line is.  S2 states that the real issue at hand is banning gay marriage.
