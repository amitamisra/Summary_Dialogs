S1 argues that state and federal laws on the issue of homosexual marriage are specifically directed against homosexuals. They believe that the courts are upholding equal protections and that those who oppose the rulings do so because of prejudice. They argue that equal protection under the law is a global blanket effect and cannot be argued to exclude certain groups. They argue that barring homosexuals from marrying each other serves as an obstacle in a homosexual's pursuit of life, liberty and happiness because they are forbidden to marry the person that they love. 
S2 believes that it is illegitimate to argue that the constitution means one thing when it was never meant to in the first place. They believe that in order to get equal protection, that one would have to change the constitution to mean something completely different. They do not believe that homosexual marriage was in any part of the original meaning of equal protection. They argue that the 14th amendment wouldn't apply to homosexuals unless they were originally denied marriage as defined today.

Two subjects are discussing the issue of gay marriage.  S1 is in favor of gay marriage while S2 is against it.  S2 feels if allowances are altered to allow gay marriage, then the other restrictions would need removed as well.  He also feels doing so would reduce moral judgment.  S1 disagrees advising the general consensus is that all people are entitled to equal rights except when they include gays.  S2 argues there is no document defining equal rights making S1's argument invalid.  S1 defends his original argument by saying the Constitution as it is defined right now prevents homosexuals from their rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  He also feels that supporting the rules remaining the same amounts to bigotry.  S2 argues this by stating his feelings that if laws were altered to allow gay marriage, they would also need to be altered to allow things such as incest marriages, challenging S1 to offer information to support why gay marriage laws should be passed; however, a ban remain on other such unions.

S1: The court upholds equal protections, but not for gays in federal and state laws. Equal protection under the law is for all. There is no evidence in the constitution that equal protection does not extend to homosexuals. For gays, not being able to marry is an obstacle to their pursuit of life, liberty and happiness. Gay partnerships are not protected in the same way that heterosexual marriages are. Denying gay marriage means denying an equal right. 

S2: Marriage is restricted by age, sex, species, number, capacity etc. If equal protection for gay marriage is desired, than these restrictions would have to be removed. The constitution would have to be changed. Gay marriage is not a part of the term "equal protection" in the constitution. The original understanding of the 14th amendment does not apply to gays unless they are denied marriage (as it is defined today) for being gay.

S1 cites court decisions upholding equal protections for people regardless of sexual orientation. He accuses S2 of claiming the courts are engaging in illegitimate judicial activism whenever they support equal rights for homosexuals. He argues that it is unconstitutional to prevent homosexuals from marrying because that would be restricting their pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness. He says that heterosexuals take the right to marry the person you love for granted and should extend the same right to people in homosexual relationships. 
S2 reasserts his claim that it is illegitimate to misinterpret the original constitutional meaning of equal protection. He claims that true equality would require relaxing the marriage restrictions based on age and species, for example, which he suggests would be inappropriate. He claims that homosexuals are not being denied the right to marry because they are gay, but rather because the genders of the two people involved to not fit the criteria for marriage. He claims this demonstrates equality because two straight males or females would not be legally allowed to marry either.

S1 Accuses S2 of using straw-men in arguments. States courts have supported equal protection. Claims S2 doesn't understand definition of equality, and of being maliciously disingenuous. S2 Denies use of straw-men, asks for their use to be pointed out. Denies original intent apply to gay marriage under equal protection due to lack of documentation. Asks why S1 doesn't answer question. References other limitations to marriage that exist. S1 Sarcastically calls self stupid for believing constitutional mention of equal protection applied to gays. S2 Questions existence of documentation that links equal protection to gays but not other groups. S1 Accuses S2 of bigotry and links denial of gay marriage to being a denial of "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness". S2 Accuses S1 of ignoring S2's points and instead insulting him. Accuses S1 of borderline breaking the rules of the forum. S1 States that the lack of equal protection is obvious to a blind-man, S2 is deliberately denying facts. S2 Questions why it is wrong to deny gay marriage but not to deny incestuous marriage.
