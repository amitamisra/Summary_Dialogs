S1 claims that legalizing same-sex marriage requires redefining family and marriage and that it would affect traditional marriage. He references a person named Colson who believes that same-sex households are deficient compared to heterosexual households in the same way that a single-parent household is deficient compared to a two-parent household. There is nothing inherently wrong with the deficient family systems, but they are not ideal. S1 notes that he does sometimes agree with gay rights supporters, for example, believing that the constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage is a bad idea, that homosexuals do experience violence and harassment, and that homosexuals should not be discriminated against when it comes to adoption, housing, or employment. 

S2 rejects the comparison of same-sex households to single-parent households by noting that there is not a constitutional amendment to ban single-parenthood. He claims that S1's inconsistent arguments in favor of and against same-sex marriage make it doubtful whether he actually does support gay rights, and he suggests that it is possible that S1 is being paid to post on the forum.

S1 feels that marriage and family are being redefined, and that including gay marriage into the definition of traditional marriage affects traditional marriage in a negative manner. He expresses that he supports some of what Colson says and doesn't support some of the other stuff he says. He admits to accidentally miss-wording something, and refutes any "game" being involved. He feels that S2 is being hostile, and that S2's main reason for being there is to disagree with people and not to debate the topic at hand.
  S2 feels that Colson has done very well for being a felon, but that he should stop drawing conclusions about gay parenthood based on observations of single parenthood. He thinks S1 does not actually support gay rights, but is purposely misrepresenting himself, and points to times that he said one thing and then voiced opposition to that same thing. He questions wether S1 might be getting paid to be there, and feels this is the least bad reason that S1 could have for the discrepancies in his views.

S1 believes that what is happening is a redefining of the meanings behind family and marriage. Specifically, they believe that the definitions for both are being broadened. This person argues that to certain people, that is what matters and is why people oppose homosexual marriage. They point out that those who speak out against it believe that traditional families perform the best in terms of raising children and keeping them from becoming criminals. He or she argues that these people do not believe that single parent homes are bad, necessarily, but that a home with both a mother and a father are best. However, he or she personally agrees with the homosexual movement's opinions on the matter of homosexual marriage and that there should be efforts to stop discrimination and harassment.
S2 believes that people with opinions opposing homosexual marriage are getting their opinions from negative observations of single parenthood. They do not believe that S1 has been consistent in their arguments and that S1's opinions lean towards standing against homosexual rights rather than supporting them.

S1 is pointing out that by changing the definition of marriage in a proposed amendment it will affect traditional marriages. S1 quotes Colson and is attempting to make sure that Colson is not misrepresented. That Colson's belief is that the "traditional" household is the best scenario and does the best job in regards to keeping their children out of prison. He asserts that Colson feels the same regarding single parent households as well. That they are not "bad" but traditional households have the most success. S1 agrees with some of Colson's points but also agrees with many gay rights issues regarding discrimination, harassment, and adoption. S1 also points out that S2 seems to attack posters personally rather than the topics at hand. 
S2 feels that S1 continually draws conclusions about gay marriage from single parent household statistics. S2 also feels that S1 may be compensated financially for participation in the forum due to the discrepancy of S1 opposing the amendment and his stated beliefs but constantly bringing up arguments which are in opposition to those beliefs.

S1 begins by defending Colson, who does not appear directly in the conversation but primarily deals with issues of single parenthood in favor of traditional families.  This then carries into the debate on same sex marriage arguing the family structure is not as secure, even looking at whether or not children of non traditional families end up in prison at higher rates.  S1's argument gets confused when he later states that he is in favor of sex sex adoption, quite contrary to the beliefs of Colson whom he was initially defending.  He also speaks in favor of protects for homosexual relationships and individuals and against the amendment that would prevent gay marriage.
S2 takes issue with what Colson argues pointing out that single parenthood has not been attacked politically through attempts at amendments.   He mostly questions S1's validity, accusing him of being paid to post.  There is not much opinion being given from S2 but rather objections to much of what S1 has said both in the current text as well as mentions of previous debates.
