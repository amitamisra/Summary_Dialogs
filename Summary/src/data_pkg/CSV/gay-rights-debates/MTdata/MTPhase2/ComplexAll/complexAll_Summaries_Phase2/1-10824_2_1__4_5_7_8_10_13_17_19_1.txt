S1 does not believe that new laws will call for the imprisonment or execution of homosexual citizens in the United States. They believes that there is more danger of economic collapse under President Obama than those laws concerning the gay issues. They don't think that S2's fears are warranted and such extremes cannot happen again.
S2 believes that every Republican candidate has stood on a platform that opposes gay rights, such as marriage and civil unions and wish to reinstate sodomy laws across the country. They argue that President Obama personally believes that marriage is between one man and one woman, but does not wish to push his personal beliefs into law and instead has supported marriage equality as much as he can. They argue that no president has done more for the homosexual community as President Obama. They argue that there is a legitimate danger of laws going too far and that imprisonment of homosexuals can happen as it was federally accepted in the past of different races such as the Native Americans and Japanese.

S1 believes that the gay-rights movement, S2 in particular, are paranoid.  There is not much being said to support his argument, most of the conversation is dominated by S2.  He argues that economic issues are more likely to hurt those in the gay rights movement than any possible laws.
S2 has concerns about the possibility of creating a true second class citizens of  the GLBTQ community.  He refers to President Obama of being the only politician to put his beliefs aside and support gay marriage.  He references past injustices to support his claims that it is possible that gays will be lawfully discriminated against.  He mentions Native Americans and the genocide they experienced; Japanese Americans and the internment camps; African Americans and past slavery.  He worries that history will be allowed to repeat itself in the form of discrimination of homosexuals and points out recent attempts at renewing sodomy laws by some politicians.  At the end he seems to be in favor of an amendment to the Constitution to protect gay rights.

S1 references a Yahoo News article titled "On Gay Marriage, Media Gives Obama a Pass." He accuses S2 of being a fear-monger, claiming that it is absurd to claim that people are attempting to imprison or execute homosexuals in the United States and that the police are not currently attempting to prevent people from engaging in homosexual behaviors. 
S2 claims that every republican presidential candidate in the previous election wanted to ban same-sex marriage and to persecute homosexuals by reinstating anti-sodomy laws. He mentions that although President Obama believes that marriage is between a man and a woman, he is not willing legislate based on his personal beliefs, so he has been a strong supporter of marriage equality, more so than any other president in US history. S2 accuses republicans of basing their legislation of personal beliefs and claims that the rights of homosexuals should be protects through a constitutional amendment that restricts religion's role in society in order to prevent future human rights atrocities like those that occurred to Native Americans and Japanese Americans.
