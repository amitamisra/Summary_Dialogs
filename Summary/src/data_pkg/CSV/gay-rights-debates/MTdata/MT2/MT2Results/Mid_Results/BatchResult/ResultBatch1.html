But however much I disagree with Sullivan on many political issues , he's right about that . The world did change when the Mass . legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights . It may be a big change in a small state , but it is a recognition that the winds of change are blowing against homophobic bigotry . You are just going to have to get over it . The world just isn't as anti-gay as it used to be . And that means that you are going to have to accept equal rights eventually , as gay marriage . Presumably you will hope than in a few years , bigots in Massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality . I think you'll be out of luck .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You wish that I wish . Do you just like to argue for the sake of being argumentative ? You've picked out the one single thing I said there that you could disagree with and are making an issue of it , not even willing to agree on anything else I said . But fine , go ahead and think this is some world-changing event if it makes you feel better . Well , clearly you didn't even read my post . ( shrug ) <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You have often posted here that you oppose gay marriage . That means you oppose equal rights for gays . If you have changed your mind , and hope that Massachusetts doesn't overturn gay marriage , you would have said so . Since you didn't , you don't .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No , you said you I " will hope than in a few years , bigots in Massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality " . I had said , very plainly , that I think such legislation is an over-intrusion by the government . Clearly you didn't read my post . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Are you claiming now you are in favour of legal marriage for gays in Massachusetts now the legislature has voted for it ? Because if so , that would be a change .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I'm saying that I would not want an amendment put in place banning it , because that would be an over-intrusion into peoples ' lives by the government . So naturally , I wouldn't want such an amendment voted into creation , either , and that's why I took issue with your claim that I would . That's been my position here for as long as I remember . And it's a true conservative position ( as opposed to neocon ) , BTW . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Are you saying that you are not in favour of a government ban on gay marriage ? You oppose DOMA laws ?

S1 states that the world changed when the Mass. legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights.  To him, it means that people are changing against homophobic bigotry and he contends that S2 hopes that the bigots will overturn equality.  S2 disagrees with this, stating that the court decision for equal rights is not a big change, and he only disagrees because the legislation is an over-intrusion by the government.  S1 rebuts stating that such a position means S2 favors gay marriage, to which S2 rebuts by stating that he believes that legislation favoring or banning gay marriage are both over-intrusive into people's lives by the government.<br><b> key:   </b>1-5176_12_7__15_16_17_18_20_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>Who are you to say it is unjust ?

Of course being a heterosexual you would not understand . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I suggest you get a majority of people and change the law then . This is what happened during slavery ... they actually passed 3 amendments about it . The courts aren't the all knowing group of people that have enlightened minds about what is or isn't fair . Your whole case is based on saying the majority is always be ignored if someone objects to them . I am in the minority when it comes to abortion ... does this mean the court should listen to me and declare abortion illegal ?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No because abortion does not effect your life personally . That iis waht we mean the courts should look at the INDIVIDUIALS life and decide upon that . If a law that the majority favors is unjust in an individuials life then it must be over ruled for the individuials sake . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>What ? That makes no sense . If a law is unjust to one person then it needs to be overruled ? Of course unjustice is defined by the person in question . You make no sense here . You still fail to understand how our courts work too . You want them to work a certain way as opposed to the way they were created under our constitution .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You want a society that oppresses people . If the law effects even one person adversly then it is unjust and needs to be overturned .

I'm not saying businesses can't legally do it -- they can -- I'm saying I think it's pretty unethical . It's easy for you to sit back and say what you're saying when you dislike religion , but this is no different than an employer telling a gay employee they can't express themselves as being gay on the job . One is discrimination for being gay , the other is discrimination for being religious . If you're going to be for equality , then be for equality in all cases . Not just picking and choosing your pet issues .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Once again jyoshu ; I manage a fast food resturant . Do you agree that I do not have to serve boy scouts and evangelical christains ? My moral beliefs are against them I should have the right to turn away their business . After all they go against my religious beliefs so I can refuse to serve , or even hire them . Right ? If I use your logic I should beable to do whatever I want and use my religious beliefs as an excuse . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Mistaken notion ? She said clearly " I've worked on plenty of legislation . . . We enact the will of the people " It sounds to me like she's a legislator . That's certainly the way it comes across -- how could you possibly take that any other way ? A better analogy would be if you were trying to force a Jewish employee , whom you KNEW was Jewish , to work on his sabbath rather than being willing to work with him about that . Or to suddenly tell him he has to eat a pork sandwich or something . And remember , this is a different issue than benignly serving food . We're talking about a major religious issue here -- gay marriage , to religious people , is like asking them to approve most any bad thing in society you can think of . You have to take the seriousness of the religious view into account here somewhat .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Why ? It is not my problem they have evil religious values . Do they work for the state or God ? Does God pay their paychecks or do the taxpayers ? They just have to sign a civil contract . So what if that person is the only person able to do marriage contracts in the area . How does the state ensure that gay people can exersize their right to marriage if the only person able to perform the marriage is exempted from perfoming the marriage based upon religious beliefs ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I just think you are viewing this the wrong way -- making it more complicated than it is . It is simply a provision that allows a person to let someone else conduct the civil ceremony if their religious beliefs don't allow them to do it . The same idea that would allow a Jewish person to pass on eating pork if it were suddenly expected for him or her to do it when it wasn't before . That's all this is -- let's not make mountains out of molehills ...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yet what if there is no one else in the community ? How is the government going to ensure gay people are able to exersize their rights ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well , then I guess they need to ensure someone is there that WILL do it as well .

S2 then proposes a scenario where the only person available to perform the gay marriage ceremony is exempted based on religious beliefs, their rights won't be upholded.

Case in point , the " traditional definition " of marriage according to Blackwell's Commentaries on the Common Law meant the disappearance of the identity of the woman into the identity of the man .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The legal definition is a human-made construct and as such can change . But given it is a human-made construct and we live in a democracy , the way it would change is via a vote . In 26 states so far the definition of marriage remains one man and one woman . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not so . Fundamental rights are not subject to plebescites . See Loving v . Virginia for a fuller exegesis .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This seems so absolute for someone that believes in an " evolving " constitution . Perhaps we evolved out of the Loving decision which was incorrect in reasoning . Even if a right is in the constitution , it is still subject to a vote ... just takes a bigger one to amount of votes . Finally , what does marriage being a " fundamental right " have to do with anything if the question is defining marriage ? You said it was subject to change ... so how does it change if not by vote ? By your opinion ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>"    ... the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature , in order , among other things , to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority .    Alexander Hamilton Once again , if you have a problem with this , take it up with the Framers , not with me . Anyone defending the principle that same-gender marriage can be banned by state action must first show as a condition precedent that marriage is not a fundamental right or , in the alternative that there is a COMPELLING REASON to ban the practice . Even for this rogue Court , that's a high burden to meet .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I don't have a problem with it but it seems you do . What I do have a problem with is the courts deciding legislative items . You propose the judiciary become the legislative branch . On the contrary . You must show why it isn't a state power to do so . Also , you didn't answer any of my questions .

You should know that I am for no marriage in government . It should be left to a religious institution where it will actually mean something . The states should then go back to doing something that actually makes sense and doesn't reward people like Britney Spears for being white trash .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That is all well and good , but it is not the religious ceremony and sanction that gays are looking for . They already have that ; there are churches that perform same-sex marriages . It is the civil benefits that are at issue .

For example : * Assumption of Spouse    s Pension * Automatic Inheritance * Automatic Housing Lease Transfer * Bereavement Leave * Burial Determination * Child Custody * Crime Victim    s Recovery Benefits * Divorce Protections * Domestic Violence Protection * Exemption from Property Tax on Partner    s Death * Immunity from Testifying Against Spouse * Insurance Breaks * Joint Adoption and Foster Care * Joint Bankruptcy * Joint Parenting ( Insurance Coverage , School Records ) * Medical Decisions on Behalf of Partner * Certain Property Rights * Reduced Rate Memberships * Sick Leave to Care for Partner * Visitation of Partner    s Children * Visitation of Partner in Hospital or Prison * Wrongful Death ( Loss of Consort ) Benefits What do you say ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>yeah I know . I'm saying that there should be a better system . For example , if you had a best friend who you are roommates with ... both hetero for the sake of argument ... and never wish to get married then could they get some of the benefits you described ? My Uncle actually was single until he died but he had a female friend who he was best friends with ... why couldn't they get some kind of benefits if they so choose ? Hospital vistiation rights and things of that nature are obviously the most important in this kinda situation .

Your suggestion would be to marry someone I don't want to me married to , that is a different thing . It is not using " that logic " . I thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you . Isn't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities ? I am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly . I happen to think that's a bad idea .

Just take a look at the Old Testament to find marriages between one man and many women . Polygamy is also present in African and Islamic culture too . And in some tribes in Nigeria , there is a culture of polyandry ( one woman , many men ) . So marriage is not some one man , one woman thing that has been adhered to since time began .

I'm saying that there should be a better system .

My Uncle actually was single until he died but he had a female friend who he was best friends with ... why couldn't they get some kind of benefits if they so choose ?

This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality , abortion rights , and religious truth claims , leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs . But this posture is often dogmatic , intolerant , and coercive , for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues , and if one does not embrace it , one may likely face public ridicule , demagogic tactics , and perhaps even legal reprisals .

S2 provides the argument that DOMA on a federal level could actually be found unconstitutional.

Now you're saying that same sex marriage has been against society's beliefs since the year dot . So is marriage a new thing that is only a male-female thing , or is marriage something that has been around since the year dot ( and would include those examples that I gave - American Indian berdaches , gay marriage within early Roman society etc ) ? I assume early Roman society falls within the year-dot-till-now period . Smiley<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Same sex marriage has never been commonplace . There are a couple of Bhuddist sects who allow it . It was definitely frowned on in Roman Times . The Greeks had homosexual liaisons , some from desire , some for a form of mentoring reasons .

They'd be that way toward any group wanting to change marriage to fit themselves if it changed marriage from the traditional view . I assure you if there was a movement afoot in this country by polygamists to change marriage to include them , there would be a similar reaction toward that . It's not that you're gay .

I'm not saying businesses can't legally do it -- they can -- I'm saying I think it's pretty unethical . It's easy for you to sit back and say what you're saying when you dislike religion , but this is no different than an employer telling a gay employee they can't express themselves as being gay on the job .

Or to suddenly tell him he has to eat a pork sandwich or something . And remember , this is a different issue than benignly serving food .

He believes the courts are an intermediate body between the people and legislature; thus to ban gay marriage one must prove it isn't a right or give compelling evidence against it.

This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality , abortion rights , and religious truth claims , leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs . But this posture is often dogmatic , intolerant , and coercive , for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues , and if one does not embrace it , one may likely face public ridicule , demagogic tactics , and perhaps even legal reprisals .

S2 argues that the state constitution does not supersede the federal constitution, so the question is whether the state constitutional amendment violates the 14th amendment.

S2 asserts that redefining marriage to include same-sex couples does not harm anyone. He said that offending the sensibilities of people does not constitute harm.

S2 does not agree that the articles provided proves anything and Marriage has always been mostly between Men and women with the only time that gay marriage was aloud was because of different cultural reasons and not common at all. S2 then retorts that S1 must not have read the articles that clearly shown how the opposite was true and that gay marriage is indeed commonplace in history. S2 replies that in spite of the evidence that S1 read there is still not enough to prove that gay marriage was a normal common thing.  <br><b> key:   </b>1-6646_150_144_1_151_152_154_156_161_11 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>It's good to see all of the apologists coming out of the woodwork to argue against someone else's strawman argument .

It was also spread initially by blood transfusions . Do you then agree with Paul Cameron ? " At the 1985 Conservative Political Action Conference , Cameron announced to the attendees , ' Unless we get medically lucky , in three or four years , one of the options discussed will be the extermination of homosexuals .

Of course not , but that doesn't change the fact that I am angry that its here and consumes many good people and lots of resources that could be better spent curing cancer and other diseases , all because of the promiscuity of a small minority of the population .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So the lives of gay people are less important ? The statement you made is a bigoted statement . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Still throwing out strawmen , Matthew ? Show me where I EVER claimed that the lives of gays were less important .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Right here You have implied that those that the lives of those who catch and spread hiv , largely gay men in the US , are not as important and worth curing as those with cancer and other diseases . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>That's an inaccurate interpretation of what I wrote . I said that , had we not had all of this HIV in the US , our medical resources could have been doing something else , like finding a cure for cancer . That's a far cry from saying that now that we have AIDS , we should forget those infected and research something else .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>135<br>S1 and S2 are discussing the origins of the how the AIDS virus spread throughout America.

S2 then retorts that S1 is right about some of his data and that the AIDS virus can be linked to the gay community, he then asks S1 if that was what he wanted. S1 responds by saying he simply wanted an apology for being called a bigot when all he was doing was simply stating facts. S2 says that some of his opinions would lead to the conclusion that S1 is a bigot. <br><b> key:   </b>1-6646_268_261_1_272_274_289_290_291_293_294_13 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>It seems to me that the point there is that it is not a bigot ... er , spade merely because you CALL it a spade . IMO , if someone has to resort to name-calling , it tends to only indicate they are having to resort to something besides sound arguments .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Oh my . Perhaps we should say it's an anti-gay bias , or a person with an anit-gay bias ? Are the terms acceptance-challenged , inclusion-challenged , anti-discrimination challenged , appealing to you ? E Mutz or his " Joe " , assumed those protesting against gay discrimination are nuts or trying to hijack heritage , but won't say why . If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , chances are ... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Or maybe he's simply arguing a different point than you . IMO it's just simply arrogant of you to automatically write off disagreement as " bigotry " . YOUR view is that this is about " acceptance " ; but that doesn't mean that's the real issue . E Mutz is right in saying that disagreement is not the same as bigotry .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>What is the basis for the disagreement or the different point of view if it is not a lack of acceptance of homosexuality or its visible and open displays and representations ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>But the problem is that you insist on always mischaracterizing that as bigotry . It's a very ugly word , and I suspect that's the reason you use it ( for its effect ) and why you don't entertain the idea that bigotry may not always be what's behind it .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I say it is , and I explain why . Replace the word " gay " with another minority , and tell me it is not . It's an ugly thing . I've explained why I believe that's what's behind it . If you believe don't believe that , why don't you tell me what is behind it ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I think it all goes back to one's motivations . What I don't think you and some others understand is that people often don't take that stand on the basis of not liking gay people . They do it because of the way they view marriage . If any other minority came along wanting marriage to be changed from one man and one woman , I suspect they'd get the same response .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>We weren't just discussing marriage specifically . Somehow whenever gays are involved , a group of people take a stand of being opposed , because of the way they view one thing or another in society , as being straight-only , or excluding gays . Yes , from the anti-gay crowd , sorry those who don't wish to include gays . However , no other identified minority would want that , because only one minority identifies as gay . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>But it's not always about not-including-gays . That's not the basis in many cases . ( hey , that rhymes ! ) It's about the way they view marriage ! They'd be that way toward any group wanting to change marriage to fit themselves if it changed marriage from the traditional view . I assure you if there was a movement afoot in this country by polygamists to change marriage to include them , there would be a similar reaction toward that . It's not that you're gay . It's that you want to redefine marriage . Ah , there's no use . I've tried to get you to see this before .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>134<br>S1 and S2 are continuing a conversation on the proper definition of what being a bigot is. S1 says that just because someone presents scientific evidence on gays that might be offensive to some people does not mean that person is a bigot; it simply means that he has a different opinion than the other person. S2 responds by saying that if said person presents evidence and seems to have an anti gay bias then that person is a bigot. It seems S2 is trying to indirectly call S1 a bigot and S1 is simply defending his positions on Gays as purely factual and scientific nothing more and nothing less, and that S2 is mischaracterizing a strong word that he shouldn't just because  offends him.</p><br><br><b>worker_id </b>A24NNA9YH4ZIA0<br>HITid:</b>  338GLSUI43B2CJU9VJL3RY3IPUXSFB<br> <b>Status:</b>Approved<br><b> key:   </b>1-6949_18_17__19_20_21_22_29_1 <br><b> dialog_text:</b><br><b>S1:1-  </b>You wish .

The speaker also believes the world is not as anti-gay as it used to be. Speaker one believes that speaker two is opposed to gay marriage because speaker two does not support equal rights for homosexuals.

Speaker two has opposed gay marriage and likely equal rights for gays in the past, but opinions that the cause of this opposition is that the speaker believes that government is over-intruding by creating legislature regarding the topic of gay marriage. Speaker two has a very conservative stance in politics and believes government should not be interfering with people's personal lives.

Speaker two believes that the majority is oppressing the LGBT community and being treated as second-class citizens. The speaker believes that if a law effects an individuals' life in an unjust way, then it is courts responsibility to overrule it for the individual's sake. Speaker two believes society is oppressing people, and that if a law adversely effects even one person, it is unjust.

I'm not saying businesses can't legally do it -- they can -- I'm saying I think it's pretty unethical . It's easy for you to sit back and say what you're saying when you dislike religion , but this is no different than an employer telling a gay employee they can't express themselves as being gay on the job .

My moral beliefs are against them I should have the right to turn away their business . After all they go against my religious beliefs so I can refuse to serve , or even hire them . Right ? If I use your logic I should beable to do whatever I want and use my religious beliefs as an excuse . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Mistaken notion ? She said clearly " I've worked on plenty of legislation . . . We enact the will of the people " It sounds to me like she's a legislator . That's certainly the way it comes across -- how could you possibly take that any other way ? A better analogy would be if you were trying to force a Jewish employee , whom you KNEW was Jewish , to work on his sabbath rather than being willing to work with him about that . Or to suddenly tell him he has to eat a pork sandwich or something . And remember , this is a different issue than benignly serving food . We're talking about a major religious issue here -- gay marriage , to religious people , is like asking them to approve most any bad thing in society you can think of . You have to take the seriousness of the religious view into account here somewhat .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Why ? It is not my problem they have evil religious values . Do they work for the state or God ? Does God pay their paychecks or do the taxpayers ? They just have to sign a civil contract . So what if that person is the only person able to do marriage contracts in the area . How does the state ensure that gay people can exersize their right to marriage if the only person able to perform the marriage is exempted from perfoming the marriage based upon religious beliefs ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I just think you are viewing this the wrong way -- making it more complicated than it is . It is simply a provision that allows a person to let someone else conduct the civil ceremony if their religious beliefs don't allow them to do it . The same idea that would allow a Jewish person to pass on eating pork if it were suddenly expected for him or her to do it when it wasn't before . That's all this is -- let's not make mountains out of molehills ...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yet what if there is no one else in the community ? How is the government going to ensure gay people are able to exersize their rights ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well , then I guess they need to ensure someone is there that WILL do it as well . Gee , that darn religious freedom -- messing everything up , huh ?<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>119<br>The issues here appears to stem from an employee citing some religious view to his/her boss indicating why they cannot perform a job duty.

Speaker one doesn't think people should pick and choose what they want equal rights on, in this case between religion and other rights issues, that it should be all or nothing. Speaker one therefore believes that speaker two is unfairly discriminating against an employee based off their religious views.

Speaker two believes that society dictates that you have to be biased at times. Speaker two continues that if speaker one's logic holds true, then he/she should be able to turn away customers based off his/her own personal religious views.

Case in point , the " traditional definition " of marriage according to Blackwell's Commentaries on the Common Law meant the disappearance of the identity of the woman into the identity of the man .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The legal definition is a human-made construct and as such can change . But given it is a human-made construct and we live in a democracy , the way it would change is via a vote . In 26 states so far the definition of marriage remains one man and one woman . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not so . Fundamental rights are not subject to plebescites . See Loving v . Virginia for a fuller exegesis .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This seems so absolute for someone that believes in an " evolving " constitution . Perhaps we evolved out of the Loving decision which was incorrect in reasoning . Even if a right is in the constitution , it is still subject to a vote ... just takes a bigger one to amount of votes . Finally , what does marriage being a " fundamental right " have to do with anything if the question is defining marriage ? You said it was subject to change ... so how does it change if not by vote ? By your opinion ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>"    ... the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature , in order , among other things , to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority .    Alexander Hamilton Once again , if you have a problem with this , take it up with the Framers , not with me . Anyone defending the principle that same-gender marriage can be banned by state action must first show as a condition precedent that marriage is not a fundamental right or , in the alternative that there is a COMPELLING REASON to ban the practice . Even for this rogue Court , that's a high burden to meet .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I don't have a problem with it but it seems you do . What I do have a problem with is the courts deciding legislative items . You propose the judiciary become the legislative branch . On the contrary .

For someone that believes in an evolving constitution why can't it evolve away from the Loving decision ?<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>132<br>The issue is here is the definition of marriage, and what government body/level has the right to change this definition.

Speaker one believes that courts and federal government should be able to rule on the definition of marriage and cites several previous cases in the past where the federal government stepped up to introduce legislature. This speaker believes that "fundamental rights" are not subject to state votes and can be decided by government.

Speaker two believes that each state should decide the definition of marriage and questions what "fundamental rights" have to do with the "definition" of marriage. This speaker believes that it should left up to a vote to decide the definition of marriage and that legislature should not be confused with judiciary.

They already have that ; there are churches that perform same-sex marriages . It is the civil benefits that are at issue .

For example : * Assumption of Spouse    s Pension * Automatic Inheritance * Automatic Housing Lease Transfer * Bereavement Leave * Burial Determination * Child Custody * Crime Victim    s Recovery Benefits * Divorce Protections * Domestic Violence Protection * Exemption from Property Tax on Partner    s Death * Immunity from Testifying Against Spouse * Insurance Breaks * Joint Adoption and Foster Care * Joint Bankruptcy * Joint Parenting ( Insurance Coverage , School Records ) * Medical Decisions on Behalf of Partner * Certain Property Rights * Reduced Rate Memberships * Sick Leave to Care for Partner * Visitation of Partner    s Children * Visitation of Partner in Hospital or Prison * Wrongful Death ( Loss of Consort ) Benefits What do you say ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>yeah I know . I'm saying that there should be a better system .

My Uncle actually was single until he died but he had a female friend who he was best friends with ... why couldn't they get some kind of benefits if they so choose ? Hospital vistiation rights and things of that nature are obviously the most important in this kinda situation .

Your suggestion would be to marry someone I don't want to me married to , that is a different thing . It is not using " that logic " . I thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you . Isn't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities ? I am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly . I happen to think that's a bad idea . People get married for many reasons , some of which I would feel are not good reasons , but I would not make it illegal to do so . I am talking about the right to marry a person of your choosing .<br><b>Summary   <br>Word_Count </b>126<br>The issue here is whether government or religion should decides the principles of marriage, and who is allowed to get married.

Speaker one believes that leaving it up to religions groups does not satisfy what gays are looking for. They are searching for the civil benefits that come with a marriage and would like to be treated equally in that respect. The speaker believes gay should be able to marry a person of their choice and get equal rights.

Speaker two opinions that there should indeed be a better system for marriage benefits and that it is all "single" people that get screwed over by marriage's current stature. Speaker two believes that gay people should marry a woman if they want the same rights.
