This person goes on to argue that homosexual people can serve their country, but must conceal their sexuality since he or she believes that there are spiritual consequences for living a homosexual lifestyle. This person believes  that, as it is legal, if enough religious-minded people pass a Constitutional Amendment against homosexual unions and marriages, and those who oppose it would not be able to do anything about it.
S2 refutes S1's arguments about free speech entitlement by stating that it is guaranteed by the Constitution regardless if one has served in the military or not, and that includes homosexual citizens. He or she argues that forcing homosexuals to conceal their sexuality is a violation of freedom of speech. This person also does not believe in the New Testament and argues that those who do are not entitled to force their opinions upon those who do not, and that it is wrong to do so.<p><b>Word_Count189</p></b><p><b>Summary1</p></b>S1 argues that the opinions of just one person, namely Paul Cameron, does not reflect the views of the entire Republican party. He or she argues that no one has taken Paul Cameron's arguments seriously for a long time, and that no Republican in leadership would call for the extermination of homosexual citizens. This person argues that what Paul Cameron says should be limited solely to Paul Cameron and not generalized to reflect the views of the entire Republican party.
S2 counters by stating that Paul Cameron is the most quoted individual by the Republican party and that his research has been entered in the Congressional Record multiple times. This person argues that Paul Cameron's name is associated with many legal briefs filed by opponents of same-sex marriage, including Lawrence vs. Texas and the same-sex marriage senate hearings. This person also points out that Paul Cameron is president of the Family Research Institute, and that the Republican party admits to rallying the Family-Values crowd against gay rights in order to garner support for their political platform. <p><b>Word_Count191</p></b><p><b>Summary2</p></b>S1 argues that not just the common nuclear family benefits society, and that those who adopt are just as beneficial as those who do not. This person argues against tying polygamy and incest to same-sex marriage since they believe there is no evidence to tie causation between them. He or she believes that it is a common tactic for those who oppose same-sex marriage to bring a correlation of incest and polygamy to it as a means to garner support against it.
S2 argues that there is a slippery slope when it comes to allowing same-sex marriage. He or she believes that there is a cause to argue for incest marriages if homosexual marriage is allowed. This is because they argue that homosexual marriage, if legalized, will change the definition of marriage from being a legal union between one man and one woman to a legal union between any number of parties that love each other. This person argues that because of the gay marriage movement, a homosexual lifestyle, which was previously considered taboo, became accepted. <p><b>Word_Count193</p></b><p><b>Summary3</p></b>S1 argues that condoning violence is not synonymous with the gay marriage debate, and does not believe that anyone is truly arguing for violence against homosexual individuals. They argue that those who do call for violence and name calling while arguing their point are wrong to do so. He or she believes that the debate gets sidetracked whenever this happens, and has been a common occurrence in the debate. This person also believes that a number of people debating have been using violence and name calling in their arguments.
S2 somewhat agrees with S1, but believes that he or she might be taking the situation a bit too lightly. This person points out instances in which inflammatory comments were made and that certain ads for Prop 8 were deliberately inciting and inflammatory. This person believes that these arguments attempt to incite violence and that rhetoric is used in such a manner as to justify exactly that. However, S2 defends a few of the individuals S1 calls out by arguing that such things were not actually stated. <p><b>Word_Count190</p></b><p><b>Summary4</p></b>S1 attempts to interject arguments of abortion to parallel the debate, and states that potential lives don't have real or actual bodies, while unborn children do. This person points out that California's ban on gay marriage reflects the voters and their desired definition of marriage.
S2 points out that the SCOTUS look at the 9th is about how the Federal Constitution applies to gay marriage and that Maine's results were about how voters feel about it. This person mentions that Justice Stevens concluded that the fact a State's governing majority has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice and individual decisions concerning the intimacies of physical relationships, even when not intended to produce offspring, are a form of liberty protected by due process. S2 also points out that Lawrence vs. Texas concluded that though a majority may want a law, it isn't enough to satisfy a constitutional challenge of that law; The law must be constitutional and meet the requirements of the 14th amendment. <p><b>Worker_Id</p></b>A3P41XDMEM1QDB<p><b>HIT_Id</p></b>359AP8GAGGK9Q9Q7GEXRO1MJ4EB7CW<p><b>Word_Count202</p></b><p><b>Summary0</p></b>S1 is arguing that their belief of the freedom of speech is stemming what they had been fighting for and doesn't believe that everyone should at least in full have the same right. S1 specifically targets gays in which they should keep quiet about who they are and what they do especially if they are serving the same country as S1 does. S1 believes there will be some retribution in this life or the next if the general populous does not follow the word of God and goes as far as to mock S2.
S2 has their own beliefs but feels that for every American; women, children, gays, straight, men all have equal right to freedom of speech. While S1 is inputting religion into the government, the fact is that there is separation of church and state and that per the government, our freedoms blanket every individual no matter creed, color, religion, or sex. S2 is seeking the understanding that S1 has the right to believe in what they want but should also accept S1's beliefs.<p><b>Word_Count193</p></b><p><b>Summary1</p></b>S1 is in defense of Republicans as a whole group. Studies were done by Paul Cameron about gays and S1 is putting to bed the thought that if one Republican speaks out against gays then the whole group of them must be in on it as well. Paul Cameron is one person in this debate and S1 reiterates to S2 that this is the fact even though S2 generalizes the whole debate as Republicans, the Senate, and GOP all being involved.
S2 feels that the studies done by Paul Cameron are used in almost every gay-related issue that is in existence. He feels that since these are brought into the discussion and the opponents are using them, then everyone who supports Republicans must be in on it too. S2 feels that Paul Cameron has an in with the President so much so that he could actually call and the President would drop what he is doing in order to appease him. His battle is about everyone not just Paul Cameron and his studies in this situation.<p><b>Word_Count193</p></b><p><b>Summary2</p></b>S2 is trying to convey the idea that at one point same-sex marriage was seen as very taboo. Only within the last few years has it become more acceptable. S2 relates that idea with incestuous and polygamous relationship which are both still very taboo. S2 states that why aren't these treated the same and there is instead a double standard since these relations all stem from "love". S2 doesn't appear to be using fear to prove a point but rather just holding traditional marriage as the baseline and comparing same-sex marriage to all different kinds of marriage whether it be to someone you are related to or multi-partner relations.
S1 believes that using this type of reasoning is only used to spread fear of the same-sex marriage. S1 is arguing only for gay marriage saying that any other type of marriage should be debated elsewhere. It appears they only have an opinion for the rights of gay individuals and the legal definition of what marriage is. They seek to dismiss the debate on any other type.<p><b>Word_Count195</p></b><p><b>Summary3</p></b>S2 is angry with the fact that a certain forum member is posting derogatory comments about gays. S2 believes the posts are meant to incite violence against this particular group of people. His belief is that people are getting away with telling lies about the gay community. That is there is gay marriage then parents with have to force their children to be taught about gay marriage. S2 does not think that S1 is doing their job as a moderator to enforce the rules of the forum and believes people are getting away with flagrant remarks.
S1 argues the fact that gay marriage and violence against gays are not synonymous. S1 states that no one specifically has argued for there to be violence against these types of people and the matter of fact is that everyone receives comments such as these, gay or straight. S1 adds that even if every religious person must say 'no violence' after their statements that S2 and their like minded people would still not be satisfied with treatment of those people.<p><b>Word_Count197</p></b><p><b>Summary4</p></b>S1 is seeking out someone to debate them about issues of abortions. Then changing the subject begins to speak on the subject of SCOTUS overturning on the 9th, trying to incite S2.
S2 realizes that S1 is looking for someone to debate on abortions but seeing as S1 has made claims already about gay rights that would lose their arguments on abortion topics. S2 declares that S1 never addresses a full idea and just repeats the same idea about abortion causing less crime in areas. When S1 brings up the topic of gay marriage S2 rallies and lets them know that they have two different beliefs on the issue. While they are two entirely separate issues S2 concludes that in the case of Lawrence v. Texas that the majority want a law is just not enough to satisfy a constitutional challenge of that law. S2 suggests that S1 cannot successfully draw valid arguments between the two issues and is instead just repeating the same argument in hopes someone will take a shot at them to debate.<p><b>Worker_Id</p></b>A2B2U8VNS9DK94<p><b>HIT_Id</p></b>359AP8GAGGK9Q9Q7GEXRO1MJ4EB7CW<p><b>Word_Count204</p></b><p><b>Summary0</p></b>S1, a military Veteran by his account, is anti-gay and anti-Obama.  He engages in dialog with S2, who is not religious, regarding free speech, the don't ask/don't tell policy, and religion in general.  S2 rebukes S1 for claiming a special right to free speech as a result of having served in the military by noting that it is the Constitution that provides the right and not current military actions.  He notes that the freedom extends to everyone including 'the' gays, who should be able to speak of their orientation without losing their jobs. S1 repeatedly taunts S2 with a rhetorical question as to whether his daddy plugged 'da hole today', including once with respect to whether the Immaculate One (Obama) did so.  In response to comments such as "Soddom and Gomorroh liberals" S2 tells S1 that his New Testament beliefs are philosophical fiction and that bigots should not dictate other people's behavior based on such beliefs.  S2 replies that the religious minded can amend the Constitution to do just that.<p><b>Word_Count188</p></b><p><b>Summary1</p></b>S1 and S2 discuss Paul Cameron, a psychiatrist and president of the Family Research Institute and whether his extreme anti-gay views are representative of the Republican party or its policies.  S1 consistently maintains that the Republican party has distanced itself from the individual and his extreme views and notes that the suggestion, attributed by S2 to Cameron, that homosexuals be sent to concentration camps for extermination, is absurd and too outlandish for any politician.  S1 compares the attempt to paint Republicans as Cameron adherents to calling Democrats anti-Religion because John Lennon attacked religion.  S2 repeatedly asserts that Cameron is often cited by Republicans in legislative efforts and in lawsuits regarding gay rights issues, and counters that if Democratic politicians cited the lyrics to Imagine as frequently as republicans refer to Cameron, then they would appropriately be tagged atheists.  S2 also provides a link to a URL which may cite examples supporting his assertion that a wide array of Republicans cite and rely on Cameron in a variety of anti-gay contexts.<p><b>Word_Count189</p></b><p><b>Summary2</p></b>S1 and S2 discuss whether the legalization of gay marriage would lead to the legalization or attempted legalization of other currently prohibited unions, such as polygomous or incestuous marriages.  S1 asserts that the attempt to tie gay marriage to incest and polygamy is a fear mongering tactic of bigots.  S2 suggests that the underlying bases of love and desire for incest or polygamy may be the same as that which motivates homosexuals to wish to marry, and defies S1 to differentiate the situations. S1 notes that the legal institution of marriage is not exclusive to gay marriage, and includes legal inter-faith marriages and inter-racial marriages, and that opponents of same-sex marriage use other taboo relationships to create fear.  S2 suggests that if incestuous people under the protests and movements that have led to the current liberalization of attitudes toward the gay community, they too would be in the present position of the gay community vis-a-vis taboo and suggests it is therefore hypocritical to require them to do so to qualify for marriage.<p><b>Word_Count192</p></b><p><b>Summary3</p></b>S1 and S2 discuss the nature of name calling and violence against gays.  They both agree that there is no place for it in debating the issue of gay marriage, but they are not in agreement with what constitutes name calling or violence.  S1 takes a broad perspective to the issue, finding it applicable to slurs and in situations where someone posits future possible scenarios about gay marriage intended to frighten or offend others, such as churches being required to perform them, or school children having to be educated about homosexuality.  S1 also expresses the opinion that personal comments and attacks in the forum may be exceeding the actual substantive points and comments about the designated discussion topics.  S1 and S2 have apparently warmed to each other after some prior testy exchanges.  They discuss other posters, including Archie and Jason, in the context of the inappropriateness of name calling in a debating forum.  S1 defends Archie and asks for specifics.  S2 offers Archie's comment "bitchy as a gay."<p><b>Word_Count187</p></b><p><b>Summary4</p></b>S1 makes anti-abortion comments and invites debate on the topic.  S2 says he is tempted to adopt S1's positions just to be able to debate S1 on the abortion issue in other forums.  He suggests he can use S1's arguments against her, including one based on "General Welfare."  S1 is willing to have the abortion debate, and S2 analogizes those who would accuse abortionists of wanting to exterminate jews to those who would call anti-gay marriage proponents advocates against inter-faith or inter-racial marriages.     The conversation turns to pending legal developments regarding gay marriage in Maine and California and whether they relate to the will of the voters or a rights issue found in the Constitutional which would invalidate a contrary State law.  S2 argues that there is a distinction in Maine, because it was an election result as opposed to a Federal Court considering a Constitutional restriction.  S1 points out that the California ban being considered by the Court was also the result of an election.<p><b>Worker_Id</p></b>A2SS24O1E0M20H<p><b>HIT_Id</p></b>359AP8GAGGK9Q9Q7GEXRO1MJ4EB7CW<p><b>Word_Count185</p></b><p><b>Summary0</p></b>S1: Gay men should not be allowed to serve in the military, nor should they be allowed freedom of speech. If they are in the military, they must stay in the closet. The Bible states that homosexuality is wrong. Even if one does not believe that the Bible is the word of God, God prevails regardless and his teachings are the truth. If enough people wanted to pass an amendment banning same sex marriage  for religious reasons or not  it could be passed.

S2: All Americans are granted rights by the Constitution. Gay men in the military must follow rules the same as everyone else in the military. It is ludicrous to believe that all people should be subject to the philosophies of a religious text that they do not abide by themselves. Especially so when people advocate for its philosophies be applied as law. Personal religious beliefs cannot be used to dictate the actions of others, no matter how right they believe those beliefs to be. 
<p><b>Word_Count189</p></b><p><b>Summary1</p></b>S1: It is well known that, in general, the Republican Party has an anti-gay stance. Psychologist and sex researcher Paul Cameron has made claims to ban homosexual sex acts in the United States, and has even called for the extermination of gay people.  In the past, the Republican Party has cited his claims in their anti-gay arguments, but not recently. No Republican in a position of leadership would go as far as to call for the extermination of gay people, as Paul Cameron did.

S2: Anti-gay psychologist and sex researcher Paul Cameron has been oft quoted by the GOP in their arguments concerning limiting the rights of gay people. His research has a moral basis, and is not taken seriously by those who oppose his anti-gay stance. Paul Cameron went as far as to call for the extermination of gay people. His arguments have been used recently, in state legislature even. His name and research are cited in legal briefs filed by the opponents of same sex marriage. 
<p><b>Word_Count183</p></b><p><b>Summary2</p></b>S1: Polygamy and incest are considered less socially acceptable than homosexuality, but they are often used in the arguments of opponents of gay marriage to indicate the slippery slope of gay marriage. The incest and polygamy examples are used to incite fear by suggesting that gay relationships are just as unnatural. This argument is used to distract from the main argument of gay marriage.

S2: If incestuous society made themselves known as gay society has, it is possible that they could be accepted on the same level that homosexuals are now, and become more normal. If two siblings want to marry, that is their choice, just like if two men want to marry. Incest is wrong because people do not accept it. Gay relations are still somewhat taboo, but homosexuality is being socially accepted. The same could happen for sibling relations. Gay marriage WILL mean that the definition of marriage changes; from man and woman to any two parties that love each other. 
<p><b>Word_Count129</p></b><p><b>Summary3</p></b>S1: Just because a person opposes gay marriage does not necessarily mean that they condone violence against homosexuals. People will opposed gay marriage on religious grounds. Gay marriage supporters may jump to the conclusions that gay marriage opposes condone violence towards homosexuals because of their religious beliefs. Verbal abuse and violence is associated with opposing gay marriage.

S2: Those who oppose gay marriage believe that having accept gay marriage (as heterosexual marriage has been accepted) means that the life and opinions that they have chosen for themselves will be threatened. They believe that informing children about gay marriage or having gay marriage ceremonies in churches threaten the life they believe to be the right way to live. 
<p><b>Word_Count153</p></b><p><b>Summary4</p></b>S1: The majority opinion and moral opinion on gay marriage will prevail over the Constitution and federal law. If enough people oppose gay marriage, then they will have the laws themselves changed to disallow it.

S2: Opposers to gay marriage could use a general welfare claim to support their argument. But ultimately, it is up to the federal government, not the vote of the people where laws are concerned. A states governing majority may not outlaw a practice on the grounds that it is deemed immoral. Additionally, the intimacies of physical relationships, gay or straight, are a form of liberty protected by the due process of law. Laws still have to be constitutional and meet the requirements of the 14th amendment in order to be passed. Questions of morality are not enough to change laws. 
<p><b>Worker_Id</p></b>A16M3Z8PFAN9KW<p><b>HIT_Id</p></b>359AP8GAGGK9Q9Q7GEXRO1MJ4EB7CW<p><b>Word_Count185</p></b><p><b>Summary0</p></b>S1 believes he fought for his freedom of speech right when he served in the US military. He borrowed Bible terminology such as Sodom and Gomorrah, stiffed-necked crowd to describe gay people and those who support them. He believes that gays should not openly state their sexuality in the military. He believes that a Constitutional Amendment passed by a majority to legislate against gay unions and gay marriages is perfectly legal. S2 repeatedly mocked S2s sexual orientation with crude sexual references.
S2 finds S1s claim to have fought for freedom of speech ironic given S1s position that gays do not have the right to openly serve in the US military. S2 believes that the Constitution grants freedom of speech to all US citizens  it is a right that is not earned by serving in the military. He views attempts to legislate against gays as imposing the Christian religious belief on every US citizen. S2 ignored S1s crude references to his sexual orientation.<p><b>Word_Count192</p></b><p><b>Summary1</p></b>S1 maintains that the Republican Party(GOP) neither called for the extermination of nor for gays to be interned in concentration camps. He asserts that S1 attempts to link psychologist Paul Camerons position on gays to the GOP are invalid because Cameron is not part of the partys leadership. Therefore Cameron does not speak for the GOP. Claiming that the GOP is anti-gay on the basis of Camerons comments is like saying the Democratic Party is anti-religion on the basis of John Lennons call for a world with no religion. Furthermore, no one in the Republican leadership cites Cameron in a long time.
S2 asserts that Paul Cameron is the most quoted expert cited in Republicans attempts to limit the rights of gay people. Therefore it is fair to take Camerons comments as representative of the GOPs position on gays. S1 contends that the GOP consistent use of family values as a pretext to rally support against gay rights reveals their anti-gay stance. Therefore S1s claims that the GOP is not anti-gay is laughable.<p><b>Word_Count181</p></b><p><b>Summary2</p></b>S1 asserts that opponents to gay marriage are using incest and polygamy to incite irrational fear of allowing gay marriage. He challenges S2 to prove that allowing gay marriage will lead to a rise in incestuous and polygamous marriages. He rejects S2 reasoning that one cannot accept gay marriage without accepting incest and polygamy. He believes gay marriage should be considered on its own merits and shortfalls without being drawn into a false dilemma of either accept everything or else don't accept one thing.
S2 asserts defining marriage as a legal union between two persons who love each other will open the way for incestuous and polygamous marriage to become legal.  S2 reasons that same-sex, incestuous and polygamous relationships are considered taboo by society. Same-sex relationships emerged from its taboo status through parades and promotional efforts to gain public approval. But incestuous people didnt attempt to obtain societal approval through the same process. Allowing same-sex marriages while outlawing incest and polygamy would be a double standard.<p><b>Word_Count185</p></b><p><b>Summary3</p></b>S1 asserts that speech against gay marriage is not speech advocating violence towards gays. Therefore it is proponents for gay marriage should avoid claiming that those who are against gay marriage condone violence against gays. S1 believes that one should not have to stop standing up for their principles just because of extremist who can misconstrue their stance as condoning violence against gays. S1 believes that it is possible to conduct a rigorous debate on gay marriage without each side resorting to personal attacks and threats of violence over disagreements. 
S2 quotes another forum poster as an example of how anti-gay speech incites extremists to spew hate-speech against gays. Therefore those who expressed anti-gay speech are responsible for inciting violence against gays. S2 finds the forum board moderators being selective in censoring phrases that are personal attacks on gays. S2 asserts that while S1 may not have used name-calling and personal attacks, S1 uses passive aggressive tactics to attack those who disagree with his stance on gay marriage.
<p><b>Word_Count191</p></b><p><b>Summary4</p></b>S1 brought out an abortion topic in a gay marriage forum thread. S1 agree to debate S2 on gay marriage anytime even though he thinks that S2 will not learn anything from the debate. S1 ask S2 if Maines voter results on gay marriage will result in the SCOTUS overturning the 9th Amendment as applicable to include gay marriage. 
S2 calls S1 out on posting an abortion topic on a gay marriage forum thread. S2 contends that the Maine vote is about how the majority of voters feel about gay marriage, and the 9th Amendment is about how the Federal Constitution applies to gay marriage. S2 cited LAWRENCE V. TEXAS which states that the fact that a majority want a law is not enough to satisfy a constitutional challenge of that law. Thus S2 asserts that the Maine vote is does not have a bearing on the 9th Amendment. S2 asserts that the Maine vote has to be constitutional and meet the 14th Amendment for it to be legally binding.</body> </html></body> </html>
