This person believes that anti-homosexual sentiments are based on prejudice and that those who oppose homosexual lifestyles use religion and morals as an excuse to say that they aren't actually prejudiced. This person voices a displeasure in those who would press their own personal biases upon others, especially when using morals or religion as reasons for doing so.
S2 believes that people can have a strong moral or religious belief and not be prejudiced. This person does not approve of a homosexual lifestyle and argues that it is not because of prejudice but because of his or her personal religious beliefs. He or she, however, states that they have no desire to impose such beliefs on anyone else. This person believes that what they personally believe is not what everyone else does, and agrees that people can falsely claim a moral or religious opposition to homosexual lifestyles. <p><b>Word_Count191</p></b><p><b>Summary1</p></b>S1 believes that in 1909, the stance against homosexuality was based on a moral obligation and not prejudice because homosexuality at that time was viewed as behavioral and not genetic. This person parallels the treatment of women and blacks during that time period and state that it was viewed, back then, as morally right. They argue that since most people viewed homosexuality as a behavior and not a state of being in 1909, it couldn't have been prejudiced. This person does not believe that there was a social identity among homosexuals in 1909 because society viewed it as morally wrong.
S2 argues against the idea that ignorance is a reasonable excuse for prejudice. This person also uses the parallel of treatment of blacks and women, but argues that morality was an excuse to hide the prejudice. They argue that ignorance is what led to a distinct prejudice towards certain lifestyles and people, and argues against the idea that there wasn't a social identity for homosexuals in 1909 when there was obvious disapproval aimed in their direction. <p><b>Word_Count189</p></b><p><b>Summary2</p></b>S1 argues that group marriages would not make sense under current marriage laws, as they only account for two individuals in a legal marriage. They state that opponents of homosexual marriage tend to argue that a change to marriage law would make it too open ended. This person does not believe that to be true, and argues that homosexuals are not trying to broaden the scope of marriage, but only change the law to be inclusive of themselves. They believe that bringing up hypothetical arguments to the contrary is a distraction.
S2 argues that an effect of homosexuals being allowed to legally marry would lead to even more changes to marriage laws that would include more than simply homosexual relationships. This person believes that allowing homosexual marriage is a case that broadens marriage and if allowed, can open basis for future arguments to broaden the law further. They firmly believe that marriage as an institution is between a heterosexual male and female and that changing that in any way gives legal grounds to continue changing it. <p><b>Word_Count191</p></b><p><b>Summary3</p></b>S1 believes that since support for marriage equality is growing, it is only a matter of time before the majority votes in its favor. This person uses the DC council votes as evidence to support this as well as the fact that five states have passed gay marriage legislation. They state that any step towards viewing homosexuals as normal people is a good thing, and that even viewing civil unions in a positive light would and could be enough.
S2 does not believe that marriage equality is something that the majority of the voters wish to see enacted. This person argue that any legislation put into motion has been pushed around the voters, and never accounted for on an actual ballot. They refute S1's argument that five states have passed gay marriage legislation on the grounds that it was not done via the voters, and never actually put on a ballot. They argue that if homosexuals were willing to simply accept civil unions that are equivalent to marriage, they might find stronger grounds for legal acceptance. <p><b>Word_Count187</p></b><p><b>Summary4</p></b>S1 believes that new England and New York will have gay marriage within the next few years and that the west coast might come soon after. They argue that after this time period, gay marriage legislation will stop for the next twenty years or so and that thirty states already define marriage as between one man and one woman. They do not believe that the supreme court would overturn gay marriage bans as unconstitutional and believes that states will ultimately be the ones to recognize whether it should be legal or not. They argue that current marriage laws are disputed between states and have been for decades and believes that the courts will be unable to intervene.
S2 believes that a federal recognition of gay marriage will be soon coming, and argues against S1's claims on the basis of Roberts and Alito being constitutional literalists. They believe that there is enough support in the Supreme Court to follow the constitution as written and that it will find any laws prohibiting gay marriage unconstitutional as a result.<p><b>Worker_Id</p></b>A2SS24O1E0M20H<p><b>HIT_Id</p></b>3QGTX7BCHP27BYNYKZ221F98MQ35ZF<p><b>Word_Count185</p></b><p><b>Summary0</p></b>S1: Religion is a good tool to guide ones own actions, but not for telling others how to live. People have been prejudiced against homosexuals for a long time. Moral or religious prejudice is still prejudice. A person can claim a moral or religious stance without having one. You cannot justify an anti-gay agenda on morals or religion. An anti-gay stance on the grounds of religious belief is prejudice. Prejudice based on religious belief implies that a religious persons acts of prejudice could have a negative impact on homosexuals, because they believe that being gay is morally reprehensible. 
 
S2: Prejudice is a fact of human existence. Christianity is a moral system. When people claim religion in morals, they abandon that moral system. It is religious belief - not prejudice - that makes one take an anti-gay stance. The Bible says that homosexuality is wrong, so if you believe in the Bible as your moral canon, then you believe that homosexuality is wrong as well. 
<p><b>Word_Count198</p></b><p><b>Summary1</p></b>S1: In 1909, being homosexual was morally wrong, and people could be prejudiced about something that they did not recognize as innate. There was little historical evidence to prove that people in 1909 believed that it was right or good to oppress black people or women, and this sentiment extend to homosexuals. In 1909, people knew that gay sex occurred and they understood its occurrence to be entirely behavioral, and therefore, immoral. Homosexuality was not understood as a social identity back then, so there was no gay lifestyle to be prejudiced against. Sodomy was criminalized, not being gay.

S2: There was prejudice against gays in 1909 just as there is now. The immorality of homosexuality in 1909 is based on ignorance. As long as gay people lived straight, they could be as sexually non-normative as they wanted to be. There were terms for gay men back then, like sodomite and molly, so there was a clear identity for people to be prejudiced against. Men who acted gay were punished for it in 1909. 
<p><b>Word_Count158</p></b><p><b>Summary2</p></b>S1: Opposers to gay marriage often jump to conclusions about who can get married why not cousins, group marriages, children, dogs? Polygamous marriage raises legal concerns that are not currently covered in traditional marriage laws, for example. The goal of gay marriage supporters is to be able to get married  not to broaden marriage. Broadened marriage is a side effect of legal gay marriage.

S2: Gay marriage supporters want marriage laws changed to accommodate gay marriage. Broadened marriage could change the current traditional marriage laws. Polygamy, for example, would require more marriage laws changed than gay marriage would, as more people are involved. But if enough people wanted legal polygamous marriage, the laws would be passed. Marriage would be broadened if gay marriage is made legal, whether that is the goal of gay marriage or not. 
<p><b>Word_Count173</p></b><p><b>Summary3</p></b>S1: Washington DC s city council recently legalized gay marriage. Peoples support of gay marriage has been growing steadily in the past ten years, and will soon be the majority opinion. Five states have already legalized gay marriage. Those opposed to gay marriage may view gays as promiscuous and sexual deviants, but most gay men are assuredly quite normal. Civil unions will not be accepted in place of marriage, as they do not allow the same legal rights as marriage.
 
S2:  Councils and legislatures may vote in favor of gay marriage, but it has yet to be the majority vote of the people. Gay marriage should be played in a positive light by its supporters, because the current public perception of gay men is that they are promiscuous and lead a gay lifestyle that is offensive. Anti-gay marriage supporters will support civil unions in lieu of gay marriage, and homosexuals should be satisfied with that. 
<p><b>Word_Count190</p></b><p><b>Summary4</p></b>S1: Legally, it is complicated to legalize gay marriage in all states, as DOMA is in place and states have chosen not to recognize other states marriages for decades.  Attempts abide by the FFC clause to in respect to marriage (even before DOMA) require such lengthy legal arguments that they are rendered prohibitive. The choice of law doctrine must be considered and DOMA could be found to be unconstitutional by vote of the SCOTUS. How will states use the choice of law doctrine so that the FFC clause does not apply? 

S2: If Congress removes DOMA, a vote for legal gay marriage will pass quickly, and certain justices of SCOTUS already approve of gay marriage. DOMA has yet to be declared unconstitutional because there has yet to be a case made to challenge DOMA in the courts, so it has not been decided upon by SCOTUS. The choice of law doctrine trumps the FFC clause in cases of marriage contract and there is a current tradition of respecting other states marriage licenses for<p><b>Worker_Id</p></b>A2B2U8VNS9DK94<p><b>HIT_Id</p></b>3QGTX7BCHP27BYNYKZ221F98MQ35ZF<p><b>Word_Count195</p></b><p><b>Summary0</p></b>S1 and S2 are discussing anti-gay bias and the nature of prejudice versus valid religious beliefs.  S1 believes it is prejudicial to hold anti-gay opinions, whether based on religious values or otherwise, and use them to impose ones views on another. S2 agrees that religious belief can be improperly used as the pretext for acts of prejudice against the gay community, but proposes that only people who are lying about having religious values against homosexuality should be accused of being prejudiced.  S2 asserts vaguely that her belief that "Christ is a resurrected being" somehow absolves her of prejudice in being generally opposed to homosexuality.  S1 seems inclined to grant her leeway based on such a religious objection, but requests more specifics as to why a Christian must oppose homosexuality and admonishes S1 not to actively agitate against the gay community or advocate for public policies which are discriminatory.  S1 is opposed to groups such as "Focus on the Family" (may be a misnomer) who attempt to impose their views on others.<p><b>Word_Count189</p></b><p><b>Summary1</p></b>S1 and S2 are discussing society's attitude toward homosexuality in 1909 in reaction to a court case addressing a 1909 issue.  It is not clear when the opinion was issued, but S2 suggests that the unanimous opinion of 6 judges implies that a ruling in 1909 against homosexuality was not based on prejudice because the act of homosexuality was viewed more as a crime rather than membership in a group.  S1 asserts that there have always been homosexuals and prejudice against them, citing Oscar Wilde for example.  S2 argues that genetic causes were not considered at the time, that homosexuality was deemed misbehavior, and in the past were repressed enough to not constitute a known community which could be discriminated against.  S1 likens historical discrimination against the gay community to historical discrimination against blacks with slavery and women with misogyny.  S2 differentiates the latter two by arguing that nobody openly supported slavery or misogyny as a good and moral thing, whereas the prosecution of sodomy was considered a routine legal proceeding.<p><b>Word_Count187</p></b><p><b>Summary2</p></b>S1 (Kronos) and S2 (Jyoshu) are discussing the fact that there are other groups besides the gay community who may want marriage equality rights, such as polygamy advocates or 17 year olds.  Jyoshu sees the changes in law that would be required as an attack on social and legal precedent that can get out of control or be difficult to implement.  Kronos complains that this is a frequent tactic of anti-gay marriage advocates who unfairly claim  that gays want to "make marriage an open ended institution."  Jyoshu notes that whatever the intent, the result is the kind of change the anti-gay advocates warn against.  Kronos asserts that specific laws could accommodate specific groups.  He also argues that the motivation of gays who wish to marry is sincere and the same as the motivation behind opposite sex marriages, and therefore the broadening of marriage is a side effect and not the goal.  Jyoshu says she understands but complains that gay marriage would open the door to further broadening of marriage.<p><b>Word_Count189</p></b><p><b>Summary3</p></b>S1 has posted news of the DC Council voting to authorize gay marriage and is celebratory about it.  S2 (JP) asserts that the politicians will pay a price and that the matter will be overturned when it is put to a vote.  He argues that a majority of people, including himself, would support laws providing rights and benefits for gays who elect to enter into civil unions, but not gay marriage.  He asserts no electorate would vote for gay marriage.  S1 refutes the suggestion by noting that 5 States had already approved gay marriage.  He also notes that gay marriage laws would not force heterosexuals to enter into them or attend gay weddings.  S2 seemingly corrects S1 by noting that the States in question had not put the issue to the general public for a vote.  S1 states that he would be happy with civil union laws, and each of them agree that the gay community has a PR problem and that many homosexuals are actually boring and inconspicuous.<p><b>Word_Count191</p></b><p><b>Summary4</p></b>S1 and S2 are pondering the future of gay marriage laws in the United States.  S1 posits that States on the East and West Coasts will have gay marriage laws, but that mosts states will be able to prevent them with laws of their own which define marriage as between a man and a woman.  S2 is optimistic that the Supreme Court will find State laws that ban gay marriage unconstitutional if Congress acts to remove DOMA [Defense of Marriage Act].  S1 questions why the Court doesn't find DOMA unconstitutional, to which S2 asserts it has not had the opportunity to do so yet.  S2 also argues that choice of law rules in the various States will result in gay marriages not being recognized in States where there is no gay marriage, and that States have historically already done so on that basis.  He further asserts that resort to choice of law rules means that the FFC [Full Faith and Credit Clause] of the Constitution is not addressed in this context.<p><b>Worker_Id</p></b>A78NRS3RT3RDI<p><b>HIT_Id</p></b>3QGTX7BCHP27BYNYKZ221F98MQ35ZF<p><b>Word_Count190</p></b><p><b>Summary0</p></b>S1 believes it is prejudice as opposed to religious or moral beliefs which fuel the anti-gay agenda; advising a moral-bases system does not allow for the intentional targeting of another and also religion could be cited but is not based upon dictating how another should live.  S1 believes all religious based arguments regarding gay issues eventually circle around to prejudice and invites S2 to support the religious argument without this happening.  S1 advises there is no issue with people who do not try to push their views on others.

S2 concedes religion is not to blame in and of itself and eludes to the point that often times people who are claiming a religious or moral reason for their actions are doing so after having gone against the premise on which their belief is based.  S2 also advises he/she is against same sex relationships because the Bible says it's wrong but does not impose his/her beliefs on others and is not prejudice.  S2 refuses to give the summary of their religious argument.<p><b>Word_Count189</p></b><p><b>Summary1</p></b>S1 sides with the court's argument that in 1909 there was no prejudice toward gays as they didn't know what this was at that time and this makes it a moral standpoint, not a prejudice against.  S1 feels S2 does not have a firm grasp of historical facts due to the points made.  S1 rejects the point of gays having been forced to conform to society and cites that hetero-society did not believe in sodomy and due to this would not support relationships between two males.

S2 compares the treatment of homosexuals in that era with the oppression of the black race and the belief women were a lesser gender.  S2 believes the morality of the era was based on ignorance and prejudice as it is today. S2 advises the moral system used in that era was prejudice based on ignorance and society is plagued by the same ignorance and non-morals. S2 also believes gays were not thought of as human.  Free to be gay as long as they weren't openly gay.<p><b>Word_Count190</p></b><p><b>Summary2</p></b>S1 believes changing the law to outline group marriages would be a tedious task.  S1 believes transforming to open ended would open the door for other issues such as children being allowed to marry.  S1 believes those who practice other types of unions are using same sex marriage to open the door for other types of unions to be accepted and recognized as well. S1 believes this is the reason most people do not want to broach the subject of polygamist unions advising the goes is not to broaden marriage.

S2 feels laws will need to be changed to tailor to same sex marriages and the same courtesy should be extended to polygamous marriage.  S2 argues that society can deal with the issue of polygamy without opening the flood gates to include groups such as children, family members, and animals. S2 argues if the institution of marriage is to be changed to include same sex couples, there is no choice but to also face the subject of other types of unions as well.<p><b>Word_Count188</p></b><p><b>Summary3</p></b>S1 announces the vote to support gay marriage in DC and congratulates the District.  S1 feels the majority of society does support marriage equality and will vote for it advising five states had already voted for and passed same sex unions.  S1 advises they would be happy to accept the title Civil Union as long as the same rights were extended which are given to hetero couples.  S1 also acknowledges the negative image gays have received is part of the reason some will not accept the concept of gay marriage an advises work is needed to change these stereotypes in order to move forward.

S2 believes once brought to a public vote, marriage equality will not be passed and believes a majority of people would support civil unions but not marriage of same sex couples due to insurance benefits and other benefits afforded to married couples.  He/she does not support the argument of five states having voted on gay marriage but instead believes these were passed without a ballot vote. S2 agrees.<p><b>Word_Count189</p></b><p><b>Summary4</p></b>S1 believes New England and New York will pass gay marriage and the West Coast will as well; however, S1 also believes the influx of states to recognize the unions will drop off for as many as 30 years.  S1 also believes the removal of DOMA will not effect the outcome nationally advising each state has a right to pass or not pass in the state as well as the fact one state does not have to recognize another state's laws; meaning, just because someone is married in New York does not mean Pennsylvania would have to recognize that marriage. S1 feels courts will rely upon choice of law doctrine for guidance.

S2 does not agree with this information and believes if DOMA is removed gay marriage will be passed nation wide.  S2 also feels the majority of Justices will vote pro gay marriage should DOMA be removed from the equation.  Also, there is a belief each state will eventually recognize the unions entered into in states which do allow gay marriage. <p><b>Worker_Id</p></b>ADUJUZANFOWKW<p><b>HIT_Id</p></b>3QGTX7BCHP27BYNYKZ221F98MQ35ZF<p><b>Word_Count149</p></b><p><b>Summary0</p></b>S1 thinks morals are no arguments because prejudice is the most likely reason behind anti-gay groups and positions. He believes someone can claim to be acting on morals or religion when in fact it can still be prejudice and seeks reasons why others should not be gay based on someone's religious beliefs. He thinks that it is okay to believe in something for religious reasons but it isn't okay to impose them on other people. S2 agrees morals are out because people are abandoning a moral system, Christianity, when they claim religion in acts of prejudice. S1 admits that people may claim to have a moral belief and not really have one but asserts his beliefs are based on religious values and faith. As long as he is not imposing those on anyone it shouldn't be an issue.<p><b>Word_Count153</p></b><p><b>Summary1</p></b>S1 believes that the people of 1909 didn't understand homosexuality as an orientation or identity. He believes they viewed it in terms of actions and had no concept that people were gay. Therefore, it wasn't about prejudice and bigotry. It was about the fact that they thought gay sexual relations were wrong. He gives the example of saying heterosexual relations being wrong, but not being heterosexual as a state of being.  S2 states that S1 is admitting the view of it being wrong is based on ignorance but also thinks it is based on prejudice. He gives an example of people using morals to treat women and black people as inferior. He points to the term sodomite, and prior to that molly, as evidence that gay was seen as an identity, and there was prejudice towards it. <p><b>Word_Count149</p></b><p><b>Summary2</p></b>S1 thinks many of those against gay marriage often make an illogical jump from gay marriage to other things such as polygamy or lowering the age of consent. S1 thinks this doesn't fit because most of the laws on the books are designed for two people, regardless of gender, and expanding it to polygamy would require a lot more work. Furthermore, he sees the expanding of marriage as a side effect - not the goal of gay marriage. S2 believes there is no way to avoid discussing other things such as polygamy because gay marriage is expanding marriage and it is a logical assumption that if you expand marriage other things will follow from that expansion. Intent, for him, isn't the issue. Equality and broadening marriage will eventually include other things, in his opinion.<p><b>Word_Count140</p></b><p><b>Summary3</p></b>S1 believes support of gay marriage is growing and eventually the majority of people will support marriage equality. He points out that 5 states have gay marriage and denies that it is being forced on anyone. He thinks the image some have of the gay community is wrong and that gay people are boring, tax paying citizens just like everyone else. S2 points out that the 5 states that have gay marriage are due to the courts or legislature. He thinks people resent having things forced on them and fight back against it. He believes homosexuals need more positive PR to fight the negative image of gay people and highlight the benefits of gay marriage. He also thinks that most would support civil unions but not marriage, himself included.<p><b>Word_Count153</p></b><p><b>Summary4</p></b>S1 believes New England and New York along with some other states will get gay marriage and afterwards gay marriage legalization will stop for years. He takes the position that states may choose not to recognize gay marriage even without DOMA by way of the choice of doctrine law that allows states to not recognize marriages they find offensive. Even if the full faith and credit clause is pushed he thinks the process would take so long it would prove ineffective. S2 believes if Congress repeals DOMA same sex marriage will come to the rest of the US by a 7 to 2 ruling. He believes the full faith and credit clause to be a constitutional mandate which would force the states to recognize gay marriages and the only reason DOMA has not been declared unconstitutional is because it has not been challenged in the courts.</body> </html></body> </html>
