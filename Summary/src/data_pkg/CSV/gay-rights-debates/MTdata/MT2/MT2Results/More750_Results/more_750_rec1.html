S2, Lesz, is an advocate of government involvement to permit gay marriage, and also to facilitate a set of predictable rights associated with marriage unions, such as inheritance and visitation.  She asks S1 to look at the big picture and notes that Christians who are now taking libertarian views about getting government out of marriage are hypocrites and doing so merely as a reaction to gay marriage.  S1 concedes the mean spiritedness of such individuals, but nevertheless believes the government should abstain.  He proposes that the most affected single people would agree and asks for details about S2s argument.  S2 explains that her partner died at a time when they were not eligible for marriage and she had difficulties with her partners family regarding inheritance and assets.  She notes how expensive, difficult and potentially ineffective it can be to engage lawyers and try to do with private contracts what is otherwise easily<p><b>Word_Count189</p></b><p><b>Summary1</p></b>S1 and S2 are discussing legislation apparently proposed by a Ms. Musgrave which would ban gay marriage.  S1 is a gay man who notes he and the gay community will be harmed by such legislation.  He complains that a ban would violate his religious freedom.  He asserts that his religious belief is that marriage is between two people who love each other and not just between one man and one woman.  He claims the law would codify Musgraves religious belief that marriage is solely between a man and a woman and would therefore defeat his own religious belief.  He also asserts that it Musgrave would not be hurt by his own gay marriage, whereas the ban would hurt him because he would not be able to marry another man.  S2 disagrees that it is a matter of religious freedom and notes that calling something a religious belief is inappropriate in the context legislative priorities.  She suggests other arguments would be more appropriate than religious freedom, and notes that Musgraves actual motivation may well be secular.<p><b>Word_Count193</p></b><p><b>Summary2</p></b>S1 is an activist on behalf of the gay community who is opposing legislation and/or a Constitutional Amendment banning gay marriage that has been proposed or advocated by a Ms. Musgrave.  He argues that gay marriage does not hurt her, but that a ban on it significantly hurts him and the gay community.  He also attributes the phrase She wants to protect her heterosexual privilege to himself, and notes that he stands behind it.  He is vehemently opposed to evangelical Christians and is determined to take them on with protests and arguments for having crossed the line to harm the gay community.  He states he is at war with them and will do whatever it takes to knock them down.  S2 asserts S1 has failed to make a religious argument supporting his side, and proposes that the democratic process requires that the majority rules.   S1 questions whether slavery and the holocaust could be supported by a majority democratic process.  S2 finds it inappropriate to equate a ban on gay marriage to slavery or the holocaust.<p><b>Word_Count191</p></b><p><b>Summary3</p></b>S1 believes that Democratic politicians are forced to appease conservatives and therefore do not express their progressive views as openly as they otherwise would because they need to get elected and obtain positions of power in order to implement progressive agendas.  He claims conservative activism has made gay rights a poisoned topic with adverse consequences to politicians.  S2 questions whether that means S1 believe Biden pretended to be against gay marriage in order to garner votes or influence.  She thinks politicians should be taken at face value, and should be expected to make their actual positions known.  S1 finds it naive to expect a politician to be frank about his or her opinions, and proposes that the electorate has a responsibility to read between the lines  including by judging politicians by their actions and the significance and frequency of their lies -  to determine where they really stand on issues.  S2 finds S1s perspective to be political cynicism, and not a sufficient reason for the public to give up on expecting candidates to be honest.<p><b>Word_Count197</p></b><p><b>Summary4</p></b>S1 and S2 are discussing whether being for gay rights but against gay marriage is inconsistent.  S1 is comfortable with it being an inconsistency and understands why S2, who is pro-gay marriage, would be upset about someone being inconsistent in that way.  S2 does not see the positions as necessarily inconsistent.  She argues that a proponent of gay rights could exclude marriage from the particular set of rights to which gays are entitled, and therefore be consistent in promoting gay rights while not supporting gay marriage.  She implies that it would be inconsistent if an individual believed that marriage is one such right, but then failed to advocate for it.  Thus she finds S1s admission of inconsistency  surprising.  She is concerned about Bidens similar position.  Because S1 relies on subjective belief about marriage as a right, she does not have enough information to assess Bidens position and would like to know more about that.  But she asserts it is not necessarily a litmus test for whether she and her colleagues would select or endorse Biden.<p><b>Worker_Id</p></b>A16M3Z8PFAN9KW<p><b>HIT_Id</p></b>3WUVMVA7OB34H4ZFFVTJ9QPUE44AZQ<p><b>Word_Count176</p></b><p><b>Summary0</p></b>S1 believes that government should not be involved in defining marriage. He feels that it is an unnecessary intrusion into the private lives of citizens. He also feels that the governments record of involvement in marriage resulted in benefits given to married couples that place an unfair burden on single people who have to pay for the support of these benefits. He feels that same-sex couples should seek legal rights similar to married couples through a series of specific laws rather than ask the government to define marriage to include same-sex couples.
S2 believes that government should be involved in defining marriage to include same-sex couples. This simplifies the legal hurdles same-sex couples have to clear to obtain similar protection with opposite-sex couples. Since government is already involved in defining and enforcing the legal rights accorded to married couples, he believes that it is hypocritical for someone to call for government to stay out of defining marriage after they have benefitted from government regulations on marriage. <p><b>Word_Count189</p></b><p><b>Summary1</p></b>S1 expressed a religious belief that marriage is between two persons who love one another regardless on gender. He argues that limiting the legal definition of marriage as between a man and a woman imposes one set of religious belief over another. Thus it violates his freedom of religion. He argues that a person seeking to keep marriage as between a man and a woman is preserving heterosexual privilege while keeping homosexuals second-class citizens. This hurts gay couples who do not have the same legal protection of marriage as heterosexual couples.
S2 argues that tying religious freedom rights to gay marriage rights is invalid. According to S2, S1 has to show that defining marriage as between a man and a woman either prevented or harmed S1s opportunities to practice his own choice of religion. He argues that defining marriage as between a man and a woman does not prevent S1 from accepting and practicing his own choice of religion. Hence S1s religious rights has neither been taken away nor harmed.
<p><b>Word_Count186</p></b><p><b>Summary2</p></b>S1 argues that giving gay couples the right to marry does not hurt the rights of heterosexual couples. Denying gay couples the right to marry hurts gay couples and their families. S1 feels that Ms Musgrave is anti-gay and that she should be open about her anti-gay stance. S1 feels justified in taking a hostile stance against evangelical anti-gay Christians because of their hostile stance towards gay people. He believes that evangelical anti-gay Christians are abusing the democratic process to preserve heterosexual privilege and keep gay people as second-class citizens. 
S2 argues that one has a right to the view that gay marriages should be banned just as S1 has a right to the view that gay marriages should be allowed. He believes that the majoritys view should prevail in a democratic process. He acknowledges that US history have shown that the majority view does not always yield the correct position on issues such as slavery and concentration camps, but eventually the majority view arrived at the correct position on these issues.<p><b>Word_Count193</p></b><p><b>Summary3</p></b>S1 believes that Biden expressed opposition to gay marriage to avoid taking a position that will cost the Democratic Party votes. He accepted as a fact of life that politicians have to lie to avoid expressing an unpopular view that will cost them an election win. He believes that voters need to develop the skills to evaluate the trustworthiness of each politician by figuring out how often politicians lie, what they lie about, and the magnitude of their lies.
S2 believe that voters should put an expectation for politicians be honest about their views on gay marriage. He said that there is little point for voters to ask politicians direct questions if voters have no expectations of getting an honest answer from politicians. S2 agrees with S1 that politicians do not always speak the truth. Therefore voters need to master the art of figuring out how often politicians lie, what they lie about, and the magnitude of their lies. However, this does not minimize voters expectations for politicians to be honest about their views on issues.<p><b>Word_Count199</p></b><p><b>Summary4</p></b>S1 supports gay rights, but not gay marriage. He believes that his position is similar to vice-president Joe Biden. He does not see an inconsistency in his position because he does not see gay marriage as a right. He believes S2 fail to see the consistency of this position because gay marriage is a right from S2s perspective. He feels that S2 is losing focus on addressing his concerns about gay marriage to Biden who is the candidate S2 supports.
S2 believes that gay marriage is a right, and that gay people should have equal rights with heterosexual people. S2 disagrees with S1s assessment that he is getting personal with aggressive stance on gay marriage with S1. He would adopt the same approach with Biden if he is given a chance to discuss the issue with him. S2 acknowledges that gay marriage is one of the many issues the electorate is considering. He is assessing the gay marriage opinion among voters to determine how hard to push this issue with Biden as Election day nears.<p><b>Worker_Id</p></b>A2SS24O1E0M20H<p><b>HIT_Id</p></b>3WUVMVA7OB34H4ZFFVTJ9QPUE44AZQ<p><b>Word_Count169</p></b><p><b>Summary0</p></b>S1: Marriage and government should not mix. There is no reason for the federal government to be involved in marriage. Government programs like the recent Healthy Marriage Initiative are impinging on marriage unnecessarily. Individual legal benefits within marriage, like hospital visitation rights and Social Security benefits should be given to singletons so that the government does not need to be involved in marriage. 
S2: Heterosexual marriage is a natural and traditional practice in this nation, so it makes sense that the federal government would support it. The government has considered itself involved with marriage for a long time. The act of marrying another person covers many legal perks tidily. People in long-term (but not married) relationships are at a great disadvantage, because they must acquire the many legal perks of marriage separately. Moreover, familial rights trump legal ones. This is why marriage is so important to the gay community.

<p><b>Word_Count186</p></b><p><b>Summary1</p></b>S1: Two people that love each other should be allowed to marry. Putting religious belief into law (where gay marriage is concerned) is wrong because not everyone has the same religious beliefs. Straight-only marriage impinges on the religious freedom of those who choose not to have religion dictate who they can marry. Not only is heterosexual marriage being defended, but also heterosexual privilege. It is wrong to advocate for laws that consider ones choices to be in the best interest for all, when clearly that will never be true.
S2: Religious people could view the definition of marriage of any two people who love each other as threatening to their religious views. Religious beliefs could threaten straight marriage, but straight marriage is not refused or threatened as gay marriage is by religious belief. Religion cannot be used to fight legislation. People may use religious belief in their argument about gay marriage, but they push for what they believe because of what they think is best for society. 

<p><b>Word_Count179</p></b><p><b>Summary2</p></b>S1: Gay marriage will not harm heterosexuals, but not being able to have gay marriage will harm gays. Those who are against gay marriage want to protect their heterosexual privileges. What if the majority of people supported something truly reprehensible, like the enslavement of a race of people?  If people dont want to pass laws allowing gay marriage, they should own up to their terrible views. 
S2: Gay marriage not being legal may hurt gay people, but there are plenty of laws that hurt people. People are free to believe what they want, whether others like it or not. Certain people use the democratic process to have their view enacted into law, whether others like it or not. There was a time when the majority of people did support something truly wrong; slavery. However, the 13th Amendment passed because a majority of people also knew slavery to be wrong. Majority wins, for good or ill. 

<p><b>Word_Count166</p></b><p><b>Summary3</p></b>S1: Republicans and religious people have made the topic of gay rights poisonous. Democrats want to do the right thing and support gay rights, but must remain moderate in their views to be able to be effective as politicians. The fact is, politicians lie. If people want to make informed decisions about candidates, useful judgments need to be made about what they say. If we judge politicians by their actions and not their promises, some lying is permissible, as it is necessary to their position. 
S2: Politicians should not lie just to keep a constituency. Politicians should not lie at all. They should be honest about their views, whether their views are popular or unpopular. And if politicians cannot be honest, they should at least be expected to be honest. Politicians should not even be asked questions if we cannot expect them to be honest. 

<p><b>Word_Count129</p></b><p><b>Summary4</p></b>S1: Vice President Biden advocates for gay rights, but does not approve of gay marriage. This is an inconsistent view, but it is acknowledged as one because he is a politician. A compromise is preferred where gay rights are concerned; no marriage, but we should strive for equality.
S2: Gay rights and gay marriage should be the goal to strive towards, though compromises can, and most likely will be made. Biden may not claim to advocate for both, but his views are at least consistent. Where Vice President Biden is concerned, if he were pushed persistently on the gay issue, he may respond differently than he has in the past. 

<p><b>Worker_Id</p></b>ADUJUZANFOWKW<p><b>HIT_Id</p></b>3WUVMVA7OB34H4ZFFVTJ9QPUE44AZQ<p><b>Word_Count136</p></b><p><b>Summary0</p></b>S1 says marriage means many things but none of them have to do with government. He believes citizens should not encourage the government to be involved in areas that it has no business being involved in. S1 thinks it is unfair for single people to have to pay for the benefits that married people get. He asks the question of why the government should be involved in marriages. S2 says single people do not have the same issues as married people. S2 thinks the government is needed in marriage because the rights given would require multiple legal documents that many couldn't afford and could still prove ineffective when disputing with family members. Marriage licenses give many protections and benefits for a small sum of money.<p><b>Word_Count140</p></b><p><b>Summary1</p></b>S1 argues that her religious freedom is being ignored. She says if gay marriage is banned it impacts her religious belief that two people in love should be allowed to marry, and they are prohibited from doing so. On the other hand, religious freedom isn't harmed by allowing it because everyone can still marry and think as they wish - it has no effect on others. S2 says that isn't an argument for religious freedom, even though it may be a valid point about being harmed. S2 states anyone could say something goes against what they believe religiously and they could ask to smoke anywhere or drive fast, but that isn't they way the law works. S2 doesn't see marriage as an issue of religious freedom.<p><b>Word_Count143</p></b><p><b>Summary2</p></b>S1 believes those against gay marriage to be bigots and hateful in the same manner as those that would enslave others or put them into concentration camps. For this reason, S1 believes in fighting back and disrupting Christians and their lives and religious practice in the same way that the lives of gay people have been disrupted. S1 believes it doesn't matter what the majority wants if those desires harm others. S2 believes it works both ways and that if one person disrupts the life of someone the other could just as easily do the same in return. S2 points out that the law is enacted by majority, for good or bad, including slavery. S2 also thinks slavery and concentration camps are a bad comparison to marriage rights.<p><b>Word_Count141</p></b><p><b>Summary3</p></b>S1 believes that democrats want to do the right thing and want to support gay marriage but they can't because it is such an unpopular position and it could cost them being elected. For this reason, S1 thinks politicians will sometimes lie, or at least tone down, their views on the issue in order to be elected and people should pay more attention to if and when they may be doing what they need to for election purposes. S2 thinks it is an interesting suggestion but thinks politicians should tell the truth regardless of if it is popular or not. S2 values honesty and thinks we shouldn't assume they will tell the truth, but we should expect them to tell the truth. Getting elected is not an excuse.<p><b>Word_Count141</p></b><p><b>Summary4</p></b>S1 doesn't take issue with one being for gay rights but against gay marriage. He says he sees no issue with it being inconsistent. If one considers marriage to be a right then one would by definition be inconsistent in saying they were for gay rights but against gay marriage. S1 agrees with and supports Biden and his views on gay marriage. S2 does not see inconsistency but rather a position. S2 thinks there can be compromise that may be acceptable. S2 believes if one doesn't view marriage as a right they could be for gay rights but against gay marriage. In that sense the view could be consistent. S2 does not agree with Biden's views but does think that his view are at least consistent. </body> </html></body> </html>
