This person believes  that, as it is legal, if enough religious-minded people pass a Constitutional Amendment against homosexual unions and marriages, and those who oppose it would not be able to do anything about it.
S2 refutes S1's arguments about free speech entitlement by stating that it is guaranteed by the Constitution regardless if one has served in the military or not, and that includes homosexual citizens. He or she argues that forcing homosexuals to conceal their sexuality is a violation of freedom of speech. This person also does not believe in the New Testament and argues that those who do are not entitled to force their opinions upon those who do not, and that it is wrong to do so."	"S1 argues that the opinions of just one person, namely Paul Cameron, does not reflect the views of the entire Republican party. He or she argues that no one has taken Paul Cameron's arguments seriously for a long time, and that no Republican in leadership would call for the extermination of homosexual citizens. This person argues that what Paul Cameron says should be limited solely to Paul Cameron and not generalized to reflect the views of the entire Republican party.
S2 counters by stating that Paul Cameron is the most quoted individual by the Republican party and that his research has been entered in the Congressional Record multiple times. This person argues that Paul Cameron's name is associated with many legal briefs filed by opponents of same-sex marriage, including Lawrence vs. Texas and the same-sex marriage senate hearings. This person also points out that Paul Cameron is president of the Family Research Institute, and that the Republican party admits to rallying the “Family-Values” crowd against gay rights in order to garner support for their political platform.

This person argues against tying polygamy and incest to same-sex marriage since they believe there is no evidence to tie causation between them. He or she believes that it is a common tactic for those who oppose same-sex marriage to bring a correlation of incest and polygamy to it as a means to garner support against it.
S2 argues that there is a slippery slope when it comes to allowing same-sex marriage. He or she believes that there is a cause to argue for incest marriages if homosexual marriage is allowed. This is because they argue that homosexual marriage, if legalized, will change the definition of marriage from being a legal union between one man and one woman to a legal union between any number of parties that love each other. This person argues that because of the gay marriage movement, a homosexual lifestyle, which was previously considered taboo, became accepted. "	"S1 argues that condoning violence is not synonymous with the gay marriage debate, and does not believe that anyone is truly arguing for violence against homosexual individuals. They argue that those who do call for violence and name calling while arguing their point are wrong to do so. He or she believes that the debate gets sidetracked whenever this happens, and has been a common occurrence in the debate. This person also believes that a number of people debating have been using violence and name calling in their arguments.
S2 somewhat agrees with S1, but believes that he or she might be taking the situation a bit too lightly. This person points out instances in which inflammatory comments were made and that certain ads for Prop 8 were deliberately inciting and inflammatory. This person believes that these arguments attempt to incite violence and that rhetoric is used in such a manner as to justify exactly that. However, S2 defends a few of the individuals S1 calls out by arguing that such things were not actually stated.

S2 points out that the SCOTUS look at the 9th is about how the Federal Constitution applies to gay marriage and that Maine's results were about how voters feel about it. This person mentions that Justice Stevens concluded that the fact a State's governing majority has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice and individual decisions concerning the intimacies of physical relationships, even when not intended to produce offspring, are a form of liberty protected by due process. S2 also points out that Lawrence vs. Texas concluded that though a majority may want a law, it isn't enough to satisfy a constitutional challenge of that law; The law must be constitutional and meet the requirements of the 14th amendment.

This person goes on to argue that homosexual people can serve their country, but must conceal their sexuality since he or she believes that there are spiritual consequences for living a homosexual lifestyle. This person believes  that, as it is legal, if enough religious-minded people pass a Constitutional Amendment against homosexual unions and marriages, and those who oppose it would not be able to do anything about it.
S2 refutes S1's arguments about free speech entitlement by stating that it is guaranteed by the Constitution regardless if one has served in the military or not, and that includes homosexual citizens. He or she argues that forcing homosexuals to conceal their sexuality is a violation of freedom of speech. This person also does not believe in the New Testament and argues that those who do are not entitled to force their opinions upon those who do not, and that it is wrong to do so."	"S1 argues that the opinions of just one person, namely Paul Cameron, does not reflect the views of the entire Republican party. He or she argues that no one has taken Paul Cameron's arguments seriously for a long time, and that no Republican in leadership would call for the extermination of homosexual citizens. This person argues that what Paul Cameron says should be limited solely to Paul Cameron and not generalized to reflect the views of the entire Republican party.
S2 counters by stating that Paul Cameron is the most quoted individual by the Republican party and that his research has been entered in the Congressional Record multiple times. This person argues that Paul Cameron's name is associated with many legal briefs filed by opponents of same-sex marriage, including Lawrence vs. Texas and the same-sex marriage senate hearings. This person also points out that Paul Cameron is president of the Family Research Institute, and that the Republican party admits to rallying the “Family-Values” crowd against gay rights in order to garner support for their political platform. "	"S1 argues that not just the common nuclear family benefits society, and that those who adopt are just as beneficial as those who do not. This person argues against tying polygamy and incest to same-sex marriage since they believe there is no evidence to tie causation between them. He or she believes that it is a common tactic for those who oppose same-sex marriage to bring a correlation of incest and polygamy to it as a means to garner support against it.
S2 argues that there is a slippery slope when it comes to allowing same-sex marriage. He or she believes that there is a cause to argue for incest marriages if homosexual marriage is allowed. This is because they argue that homosexual marriage, if legalized, will change the definition of marriage from being a legal union between one man and one woman to a legal union between any number of parties that love each other. This person argues that because of the gay marriage movement, a homosexual lifestyle, which was previously considered taboo, became accepted. "	"S1 argues that condoning violence is not synonymous with the gay marriage debate, and does not believe that anyone is truly arguing for violence against homosexual individuals. They argue that those who do call for violence and name calling while arguing their point are wrong to do so. He or she believes that the debate gets sidetracked whenever this happens, and has been a common occurrence in the debate. This person also believes that a number of people debating have been using violence and name calling in their arguments.
S2 somewhat agrees with S1, but believes that he or she might be taking the situation a bit too lightly. This person points out instances in which inflammatory comments were made and that certain ads for Prop 8 were deliberately inciting and inflammatory. This person believes that these arguments attempt to incite violence and that rhetoric is used in such a manner as to justify exactly that. However, S2 defends a few of the individuals S1 calls out by arguing that such things were not actually stated. "	"S1 attempts to interject arguments of abortion to parallel the debate, and states that “potential” lives don't have “real” or “actual” bodies, while unborn children do. This person points out that California's ban on gay marriage reflects the voters and their desired definition of marriage.
S2 points out that the SCOTUS look at the 9th is about how the Federal Constitution applies to gay marriage and that Maine's results were about how voters feel about it. This person mentions that Justice Stevens concluded that the fact a State's governing majority has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice and individual decisions concerning the intimacies of physical relationships, even when not intended to produce offspring, are a form of liberty protected by due process. S2 also points out that Lawrence vs. Texas concluded that though a majority may want a law, it isn't enough to satisfy a constitutional challenge of that law; The law must be constitutional and meet the requirements of the 14th amendment.
