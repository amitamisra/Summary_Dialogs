3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	31SR6C8STI43JFUD1XU6216JIVGXF8	A3ITJY0L20SRQL	1	S1 contends that the spread of HIV is predominantly caused by gay men. He agrees that women having sex with men spreads the disease but maintains that the men giving the women the disease have acquired it from having sex with other men. Therefore, people today can be getting the disease from heterosexual sex but it is only because people having homosexual sexual relations started the spread of the disease.
S2 contends that you cannot you cannot subjectively blame a specific group for the spread of HIV and does not condone blaming homosexuality for the spread of the disease. He believes that everyone who spread the disease is to blame and the original source can not be identified so the lifestyle of a specific group of people should not be blamed for it. He brings up a specific example of a man and a woman having sex and spreading the disease and then trying to blame the outcome on whoever the man got the disease from instead of blaming themselves.
3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3DB52KP97JXPR0Z1TAILGB0DTJPZR2	A2VG4MJ15ZYDEH	1	S1 believes that HIV is primarily transmitted through illicit drug users sharing needles and through sexual acts committed between men, and that these behaviors are primarily to blame in creating the AIDS pandemic. S2 rebuts that AIDS is widespread among women, and that women make up a large percentage of new AIDS cases, and that this is likely caused by heterosexual contact between men and women. S1 counters that the men that women catch HIV from are most likely to have themselves caught the disease from needle sharing and homosexual sex, and that these acts have historically been the means by which the disease has become widespread, and are to blame for the disease's presence in the portion of the population that does not practice homosexual sex or illicit drug use. S2 counters that there is little evidence for S1's claims and that their position is an attempt to scapegoat homosexuals for creating the conditions that have allowed AIDS to propogate.

3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3HGH2Q5AD6EA74YEKKI83R39T9HR8L	A1FBBY2JJYRMRI	1	S1 states that males having sex with males makes them at least bisexual, and this is where the spread of HIV is coming from. The risk of women contracting HIV from straight men is very low, usually only from those who are drug users. The increase in women contracting HIV from men is mainly from having sex with bisexual men. The origin should be traced back to the beginning of HIV spreading in the US, which was mostly across the gay community. The straight community acquired HIV much less, mostly from IV drug use and blood transfusions.
S2 feels that HIV infection is occurring more and more in the straight community. Rates of HIV are raising greatly among women, and the majority of those infections are through sexual contact. It is not only the gay community spreading the disease. We cannot say for sure where the spread of the disease began, and to blame it on homosexuals does not explain how it spread it Africa. S1 is omitting information that should be demed inmportant, and therefore creating a scapegoat to blame the spread of HIV
3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	307IWC1FDHAR49WZ8PHWWTUIJ4ENC3	A2MG1LLIKMGAMX	1	S1 is making the argument that the transmission of HIV mainly comes from males having sex with males. From that point, bisexual men, heterosexual junkies who contract the disease by sharing needles with HIV infected people, & blood transfusions are the only ways that HIV has spread throughout straight America. He cites the CDC'S distinction of MSM to support his viewpoint that it was mainly spread through gay sex. He argues that HIV cannot be labeled as a mainstream straight disease. It was initially a disease that came from men having sex with men.
S2 believes that the behavior of both straight & gay America is the reason why women make up nearly one-third of new HIV infections. It is due to things like unprotected sex and that is true for both gay and straight people. He also cites the CDC's warning for women having sex with an infected partner or men with unspecified risks as risky for women not just MSM. It spreads among all groups of people. No one group is to blame.

3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3BFKZ1X4S3821O4CSI070W8SJP97CC	A2LAGENVFY2V2D	1	S1 Contends that the spread of HIV in women is primarily caused by homosexual behavior in men and the use of illicit drugs. He or she acknowledges that the disease is spread during intimate heterosexual contact but asserts that this is only possible because of previous exposure of the male partner to illicit drugs or homosexual activity with an infected partner. This participant argues that a rise in HIV infection rates has been primarily caused by the gay community. 

S2 Contends that HIV is being spread to women having heterosexual sex. He argues that regardless of whether the woman's partner has had homosexual sex in the past, the disease is still spread by women having sexual contact with men. This conversant is arguing the primacy of the direct cause of infection and not prior events in attributing the nature of the rise HIV infection rates in women. The conversant concludes that the spread of HIV in women is not primarily caused by men engaging in homosexual activity.
