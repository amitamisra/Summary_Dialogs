He finds that calling it a gay disease is simply looking for a scapegoat, and ignoring the facts there. Any evidence or numbers that point towards low cases among women is simply because the disease is still young in age. It is impossible to trace the origins of the disease, and one is simply finding a scapegoat through blaming it on homosexuals.
S1 is against the notion, claiming that any trail of HIV disease in a person can eventually be traced back to contact with a gay or bisexual male, the only exception being that the male was a drug addict. The only way that one risks getting HIV is mostly among by having sex with a man who has had sex with another man.
