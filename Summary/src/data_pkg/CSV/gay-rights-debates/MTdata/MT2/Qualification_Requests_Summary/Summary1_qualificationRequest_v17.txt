However he explains that the disease presently affects women too. He describes the origin of HIV in women as: women engaging in sex with men who are carriers of the disease that contracted it by having sex with another man. Sharing dirty needles while using drugs is another way women contract HIV. Therefore having heterosexual relations has become unsafe because of the circulation of HIV from bisexuals and MSMs, which S1 firmly believes originated within the gay community.

S2 suggests that the HIV disease is still young and will continue to grow and provides statistics that prove women make up almost one-third of recent HIV infections. According to S2 HIV is spread by men having sex with woman, therefore it is a risk to all types of people. He explains that a certain “group” such as homosexuals cannot be held responsible for a disease, and we are unaware of its origin. So ultimately we cannot use any specific group as a scapegoat for the circulation of HIV.

3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3XA0S6CIVC027130BHK8WU0CQOXEE5	A182WKCHDF8YQY	1	S1 believes that AIDS was and still is being spread among men in the gay community and that women who contract the disease do so by having sex with heterosexual junkies and sharing needles with HIV infected people.  He does not believe that AIDS can be considered a mainstream disease among straight people at this time.  He states that the disease began with homosexual men in the gay community and bisexual men are now spreading the disease to heterosexual women making heterosexual relationships at risk for AIDS as well.  In addition, he contends that the main cause of HIV among heterosexuals is through transfers of blood from needles, sex with a drug addict or MSM.

S2 disputes that AIDS is still a young disease and North America will inherently see an increase in the disease among heterosexual women and men. He accuses the other writer of looking for a scapegoat and is blaming the gay community in an attempt to relieve heterosexual relationships from being held responsible for the spread of the disease.  S2 believes that the origin of the disease is unknown and therefore no one particular group can be held responsible for the spread of the disease and states that the CDC cites that women are at risk for the disease by having sex with a man who is infected; that it's not just a disease among homosexual men. He argues that AIDS is a virus that continues to spread among all groups of people.

3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	31M9HXRS534LUHFDLL4169LLIS0CGS	A2BX6J8M2W0EAS	1	S2 is trying to assert that there is no factual or conclusive evidence pointing towards HIV being a predominantly gay disease, and that many women have contracted the disease through having sex with a man. He finds that calling it a gay disease is simply looking for a scapegoat, and ignoring the facts there. Any evidence or numbers that point towards low cases among women is simply because the disease is still young in age. It is impossible to trace the origins of the disease, and one is simply finding a scapegoat through blaming it on homosexuals.
S1 is against the notion, claiming that any trail of HIV disease in a person can eventually be traced back to contact with a gay or bisexual male, the only exception being that the male was a drug addict. The only way that one risks getting HIV is mostly among by having sex with a man who has had sex with another man.

Specifically males having sex with males.  Does not dispute that the heterosexual community can not receive HIV from their sexual relations.  
S2 claims its still a young disease and wasn't started within the gay community.  The disease is being spread by men having sex with women.  Eventually, claims that the origin of HIV is unknown.  On a final note, ridicules fellow student for claiming the disease started within a specific origin.

S2:1- Women make up one-third of new HIV infections in 1992 , women accounted for 13.8% of people living with AIDS 5 ; by the end of 2001 that percentage had increased to 21% . 6 of  women. 
S1:2- HIV can be considered a straight disease because of people sharing needles with other HIV infected people and by having heterosexual sex.  
S2:2- Facts doesn't disprove the fact that HIV is being spread by Men and women having sex. 
S1:3- If you like to have salient facts HIV is spread by men having sex with other men.
S2:3- Man may contact HIV from having sex with another man and is still being spread by man but no one is to blame if an heterosexual couple decided no to use a condom and involved themselves in activity to contact the disease.
S1:4- The origin of women with HIV comes from man with HIV having sex with another man who has the disease. Straight America has acquired the disease from needles, blood transfusions and MSM.
S2:4- We do not know the original leak of HIV started and CDC also sites that women have a threat when having sex with an infected partner without it just being from MSM.
S1:5- Agreeing with the statement, but the floodgate for the disease open up in the gay community.
S2:5-A victim of the disease is still a victim and if one group has more cases of the diseases or had more in the beginning, does it make a difference?. Its is a virus that continues to spread among all groups and I haven't seen anything that would suggest that  the most high risk for women is MSM.
