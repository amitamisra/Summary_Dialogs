<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Lesz , My marriage means a great many things to me , none of which have anything to do with our governments . My question to you is : What do you think marriage should mean to our governments ?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Well , marriage is an ancient human institution , based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans , and is one of the foundations of social stability . Why would it surprise anyone that government might wish to support it ? What really surprises me is to find how many alleged Christians NOW find it expedient to demand government " get out of marriage " , simply because gay people want to get in it . Bunch of hypocrites -- they never complained about government regulating marriage before this . Now , while I agree it isn't absolutely essential for government to be involved in the regulation and support of marriage , it is nevertheless a convenience that few people would really want to throw away . ( Mr. WriteLA has summed it up eloquently so I needn't elaborate . ) Alas , many are just too mean-spirited to share marriage with those pesky homos , so they've jumped on the get-out-of-marriage bandwagon -- which isn't going to go anywhere -- as camouflage for their real feelings . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That government would wish to be involved in any aspect of our lives , would not surprise me . That is what governments tend to do . Consider the " Healthy Marriage Initiative " . This is our government and as citizens , we would be well advised to exercise vigilance to prevent our government from intruding into areas where there is no necessity . Just because a few mean-spirited hypocrites may advocate that the government get out of marriage for the wrong reasons does not mean that the idea is all bad . Never happen ? Enlist the 100 single people who have the biggest stake in this issue and chip away at the exclusive benefits . Start with an easy one like hospital visitation and work up to the tough ones like Social Security to spouses<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Why ? Why is it in the interests of society to prevent government involvement in marriage ? That's what you haven't explained . MrWriteLA pointed out the reasons that government involvement is pretty much unavoidable , if only because government is the source of law . It seems to me you advocate the replacement of marriage with a plethora of minor and specific legal contracts that would only benefit the lawyers writing them . It's the wood and the trees . If specific laws are trees , then marriage is the forest that protects our relationships from such gales that XXXX . Is there any specific advantage to looking to individual trees and ignoring the wood ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Lesz I ask why and you ask why not . Why should government get out of the marriage business : 1 . It is not needed 2 . The current marriage benefits are terribly unfair to single people that are forced to pay for them . Your eloquence notwithstanding , I have found it useful to look very closely at the trees when solving problems . I would suggest that one cannot understand the wood unless one knows something about trees . Also , I have often found it useful to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller parts and solving the easiest parts first .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Why is government support of marriage unfair to single people ? Single people do not have the same issues as married people . Having been married and single myself , I do have some insight here . And why would you rather married people go to lawyers for multiple legal contracts to cover all the hundreds of rights and mutual obligations currently conferred by marriage ? Are you a lawyer in need of clients ? ;) My own experience of woods and trees is that there is no value in looking at them in only one way . One needs to consider them as trees and woods . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I have also been single and married . Experience but not much insight . I would be interested to hear your views about this difference in issues and how these issues are helped by government involvement . Lesz , I am an engineer , not a lawyer .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Well , single people live by themselves , not as a family . By definition , they do not have a significant relationship -- and no , I don't count boyfriends or girlfriends here , I am referring to committed couples who live together as a family unit . There are many legal issues such as inheritance , pension and social security rights , adoption and child custody , home ownership , etc. , which would need separate legal contracts without the umbrella of marriage . ( And of course , even then such contracts would only be enforceable by government . ) I myself had tremendous difficulties sorting out property issues with my partner's family after he died . It all but bankrupted me , and there wouldn't have been any issue at all had it been legal for us to get married . We did have some legal contracts pertaining to the house , and wills , but alas they weren't good enough to get his family off my back , because our legal relationship was trumped by his familial one . I am not saying it couldn't be done piecemeal , tailor-made to suit each individual couple , but wouldn't that be excessively inconvenient -- for everyone but the lawyers ? Whereas at prresent , when you get married for a $25 license , hey presto , you get those protections and the lawyers have to defer their Caribbean cruise .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Well ... so far eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue have found that barring same-sex marriage is unconstitutional . We're waiting to hear about three or four more . As for the nature of marriage , it is both a legal contract and ( sometimes ) a religious ceremony ( sacrament in some religions ) . We're stuck with the duality , whether we like it or not , and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect . Different religions can do what they want .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>They found that it violated their state constitutions , right ? This has nothing to do with the US Constitution . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The winning arguments were based largely on state constitutional provisions that closely parallel , if not outright mimmick , the federal constitution .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That's not generally true , is it ? For example , the Massachusetts ruling was based on a specific provision in the Mass . constitution that prohibits discrimination based on sexual preference . There's nothing like that in the US constitution . And my overall point was that we should be careful when calling something " unconstitutional " , in that we should be clear it we're talking state or federal constitution . Many state constitutions guarantee rights that aren't in the fedral constitution . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>There's nothing like that in the Mass . Constitution either . Though , it's a darned good idea ! Goodrich was decided on equal protection grounds , citing the Mass . document . I'd have to look up the others to see the exact reasoning , but they're not likely to be far afield from the bedrock principles of equal protection and due process . Gay rights is a real test of our constitutional system , and , so far , we're not passing with flying colors ...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're right , I misremembered . It's just descrimination based on sex that's banned .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Another problem with the study is that most ( or at least more ) people in the country very well might identify as Christian ...<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Jyoshu , you don't know how they conducted the study . You don't know what questions they asked , or what they screening process was , or anything . You're just making up objections , and deciding without any factual evidence that they apply . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes , that's the point . I'd prefer to know the specifics . Questioning a study is a VERY appropriate thing to do in any study , particularly if it's used to vilify a group of people .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So then question , don't just state that the study has a problem . And " vilify " ? Good grief ! Where did you get that from ? You seem to be taking this a bit too much to heart . A study was done , and done well from all evidence that I've seen , and the results reported . No one is vilifying anyone . If you can show an actuall problem with the study , and not something hypothetical that you came up with , than please do so . It seems quite professionally done to me , but you go ahead and dig all you want . But if you're simply uncomfortable with the results , well , that ' s no reason to go around saying that people aren't doing their jobs or are out to vilify others . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Er . . . that's why I pointed out the specific things I saw as a problem . Are you in a bit of a reactionary mood today ? Yeah , because in my experience in these forums , here and elsewhere , an enormous amount of attention is given to trying to make Christianity look bad , through generalizations , citing irrelevant studies , and misrepresentations . See , the divorce rate of Christians has NO bearing whatsoever on the gay marriage amendment . Or did you forget that ?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No more than usual . :) You , however , are stating that some is a problem , as opposed to possibly a problem . As if you wanted to simply dismiss the results , rather than actually check their validity . That's pretty reactionary . As long as people say that they're trying to protect the " sanctity " of marriage by keeping gays out it's extremely relevant , or at least a very good refutation .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Agreed She is ignoring my religious freedom and trying to institute her religion into law . The law that will bar my family from legal protections . It won't protect her marriage but will bar me and my people from from being full citizens . She isn't protecting marriage but perserving her heterosexual privledge .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>How on earth is she impeding on you religious freedom ? She isn't trying to take away your right to any religious ceremony . With such a wide-open standard of what constitutes religious freedom that you seem to have , any legislation could be construed as imposing on religious freedom . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Because it is her religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman . My religious belief is that marriage is between two people that love each other regardless of sex . She is tying to place her religious belif into law over mine . Who gets hurt here ? If my religious belief is put into law she can still marry the person of her choice . If her religious belief gets put into law she can still marry the person of her choice but I do not get to . So I and my people are hurt by codifing her religious belief into law . She is trying to keep gay people out of marriage and thus preserve her heterosexual privledge .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But by that definition , either one could be viewed as impeding on religious freedom , including your view impeding on hers ! We don't define imposing on religious freedom on the basis of having different ideals . It doesn't effect your religion or religious freedom if you don't get benefits under gay marriages . You can argue in other ways , on other basis , but the idea that not giving gays marriage benefits is imposing on religious freedom is an empty " argument " . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>But you have not shown how she would be harmed by equal marriage ? I have shown that her definition infringes upon my religious freedom . If gay marriage becomes a reality then in no way does it infringe upon her in any way . Would you care to explain how gay marriage infringes upon her in any way ? It is her heterosexual privledge and her sence of entitlement that she is protecting not marriage .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You may ( or may not ) can show harm in another sense , but you certainly have NOT shown how your religious rights are taken away or harmed , to begin with . That's the point . You certainly have not shown how her definition infringes upon your religious freedom -- you are still free to be just as religious in practice and belief as ever if Musgrave's views became law . You're trying to use a religious freedom argument here and it just doesn't fit . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Yes I have . Haven't you been poaying attention ? ] Because it is her religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman . My religious belief is that marriage is between two people that love each other regardless of sex . She is tying to place her religious belif into law over mine . Who gets hurt here ? If my religious belief is put into law she can still marry the person of her choice . If her religious belief gets put into law she can still marry the person of her choice but I do not get to . So I and my people are hurt by codifing her religious belief into law . She is trying to keep gay people out of marriage and thus preserve her heterosexual privledge .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Ok ! My religious belief says that it's important to smoke in public non-smoking areas . My religious belief says that it's important to drive cars as fast as one can on city streets . My religious belief says that the death penalty should never be enforced . Gee , this it fun , using religion as an excuse and means to an end to fight legislation ! Too bad for you it doesn't work that way . What you don't get is that , by your standard , EITHER would be placing one religion over another . The same justification could be made against your view because your view goes against MY religious belief . And then if you say " but your view causes harm and mine doesn't " then it's no longer a religious issue so the point is moot to begin with . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>YOu missed the point here she is trying to turn her religious belief into law that bars me from from getting married . How is she hurt if it is my religious belief of equal marriage is turned into law ?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>You have no idea whether or not she is truly trying to turn her religious belief into law . She may just happen to believe that way religiously , but be pushing for the law because she thinks that's best for socety . IOW , you have no idea if religion is her real motivation for the law . There's no way to know or to police someone's real motivations . <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I am part of society and her belief is not in my best intrest . How does my being able to marry a man hurt her in any way ?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Yet you still will not answer the question . How does equal marriage hurt her or any heterosexual ? If she has her way I am the one that is hurt . My way of equal marriage I am not hurt nor is she .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yes I did , in this post . I summarize : so what if a proposed law " hurts " you ? There are all kinds of laws that " hurt " all kinds of people . But I'm glad to see that you abandoned your silly argument that it would be a violation of the First Amendment to enact her religious belief about marriage , but not a violation of the First Amendment to enact YOUR religious belief about marriage . Now , if you could only justify why only laws which do not cause " harm " to others are allowed to be enacted . Frankly I am astounded by your affinity for the " harm principle " when you say things like " I don't know about the " culture war " But I am at war with evangelical anti gay christianity . I will do whatever it takes to knock then down . " <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Because I am only concerned with rights of gay people . Gay people are my first concern . This evil woman should come out and sayshe is anti gay . She should come out and say she doesn't want gay people to get married . She should admit that she wants gay people to remain second class citizens . Why doesn't she own up to her discrimination ? She wants to protect her heterosexual privledge . For the record I own that statement and stand behind it . I will talk people out of attending these bible churches . I will do what I can to legally disrupt any rundrasining activities they have going . I will protest their wedding ceremonies . I will protest their church services . As far as I am concerned , once they crossed over the line and started pushing for and getting laws enacted that hurt me , my family , ands my people , they have no place in society .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>And you have yet to show why this is not a legitimate viewpoint , nor a legitimate way to legislate this issue . It's obvious that all you care about is gay people . However , you have not shown why anti-gay ( as you call them ) people should not be able to legislate their view . All you have said is that you don't like their view . Big deal , they don't like your view either . Thus , in a democracy like ours , the majority of people decide issues like this . Besides that , I think coming out in support of a Constitutional Amendment banning gay marriage qualifies as " com [ ing ] out and say [ ing ] that she doesn't want gay people to get married . " This is fine . But also understand that it is legitimate for people who believe like Ms. Musgrave to do the same , including to use the democratic process to have her view enacted in law . If you are free to do it , then she is as well . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Should the majority have the right to enslave their fellow citizens ? Should the majority have the right to lock people up in concentration camps ? A majority of the people in the US once thought it was a good idea . Oh I want the evil woman to say it . I want her viciousness and ugliness out in the open . If she is anti gay then she needs to own up to her bigotry Repent America believes in protesting and disrupting gay gatherings . Why If they can do this I can do the same .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The majority DID have the legal right ( unfortunately ) to enslave their fellow citizens until the 13 th Amendment took that option off the table . Incidentally , it took a majority of people to take slavery off of the table . In the United States , the majority wins ( for good or for ill ) . I hope you are not trying to make a comparison between the denial of marriage to gays ( and to 10 year olds , and to those who are currently married yet want another husband / wife , and to those who wish to marry their father , etc. ) on the one hand , and slavery and / or concentration camps on the other . Ok , and what would that accomplish ? Yeah , that's exactly what I said .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Because it's all quite clear . Decades of effort from the religious right , conservative republicans , and their like have made gay rights a poisoned topic . It's a tragedy , but saying the right thing on this issue will cost you more votes than it will gain you , everyone knows it , and no one is going to do it . It's politics 101 . The democrats , as a whole , want to do the right thing , but they know that if they say so too loudly they won't be in a position to do anything . They're forced to moderate their public stances so that they can get into positions where they can actually take action . This is of course a generalization , but if you're talking about a political party as a whole that's unavoidable .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So , you're basically saying that Biden was lying through his teeth when he said he doesn't support gay marriage ? It was all just a lie to keep from losing votes ? Interesting . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Possibly , I couldn't say . Certainly as a democrat he gets more benefit of the doubt than I would give a republican when it comes to gay rights , but I haven't plumbed his record enough to say for sure . And let's be honest here , you do not find the idea that a politician might be lying interesting . :)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>What I'd prefer is that the candidates be honest about their views , whether it's popular or unpopular . But even knowing we're talking about political candidates ( who may lie to get votes ) , when a candidate says something is his or her view , I think we have to take them at what they say when they answer a question like that so directly and emphatically . Otherwise , there's little point in asking questions to begin with other than maybe watching the reaction of body language and how they would respond under pressure , and so forth . Political discourse has to operate to where when a candidate gives a given view as HIS or HER view , they are taken at their word that IS their view . " No " can't mean " yes " and so forth . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No , that's too niave an approach . We know politicians are going to tell some lies , I trust that's a given . We , as political consumers , can't simply take politicians at their word . If we want to make informed decisions about candidates we need to develop the skills to make useful judgement calls about what they're saying . We need to figure out how often they lie , what they lie about , how big their lies are . Obviously we shouldn't need to do this , it would be great if we could actually take our politicians at their word . Bad the sad reality is that we can't , not at this stage anyway . In this particular case , if Biden says he doesn't support gay marriage I'm just as likely to think it's because he knows that open support could cost him the White House as any other reason . It's sad that such double speak is needed , I'd love it if enough courageous politicians stood forth and ended the political need for lies , but until that wonderful day I'm not going to be naive and take everything they say at their word , nor am I going to jump up and down and point fingers at every falsehood . I'll try to judge the politicians by their actions , and their lies by their magnitude , scope , and quantity .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I think you are misunderstanding me -- I don't mean I think we should assume they are GOING to always tell the truth -- I mean we should put the expectation on them to be honest . IOW , honesty is what we should demand . If we aren't even going to do that , there's no point in ever asking a political candidate a direct question . Knowing they're going to lie isn't the same as having the expectation on them to be honest . I really don't think it's too much to ask our candidates to say what their views are . You just said yourself " we need to figure out how often they lie , what they lie about , how big their lies are " so , obviously , you believe it's not really good that they are lying . There would be little point in asking them questions if we aren't going to hold to them to SOME level of expectation that they're going to say what they mean . Sure , they lie , but if the words of politicians mean nothing , there's little point in even having political discourse . Political cynicism is no excuse to not put expectations on our candidates to be honest with the American people .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>In the sense that saying one supports gay rights but not gay marriage , sure . But I have no problem with that inconsistency . However , you are for gay marriage , ergo , it makes more sense you'd be bothered by that inconsistency . But if not , fine . Whatever ... ( And yes , I know you've given me your ' reasons ' . Doesn't mean there's no inconsistency there . It just means you think it's not something that should be challenged right now . )<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Again , I don't see an inconsistency in that position . For the life of me I don't understand why you keep saying it's an " inconsistency " . It's not a matter of it being a " problem " , but rather a question of why you repeatedly label it as an " inconsistency " . Just to try to put this plainly . You and biden have both stated the same opinion . Against gay marriage , but for gay rights in every other way . With your stated opinion statement , I don't see an inconsistency . But you do see an inconsistency with your stated opinion statement . Quite frankly , I really haven't seen you SHOW an inconsistency yet . You have said " inconsistency " , but not show it . It's a bit like saying " Frank is inconsistent on the abortion issue " , but that's it . It would be showing an inconsistency to show Frank's statement saying " I am against all abortion " , but then he has no problem with his wife getting an abortion cause she doesn't want to lose her figure . Nothing in his statement is " inconsistent " , IMO . If you say Biden is " inconsistent " , you are also saying that about your position ... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You know , if you aren't able to grasp the concept of the inconsistency of saying one is against gay marriage when saying they are for gay rights , I don't know what else to say . It would be different if you didn't think gay marriage should be a right . But you do , so how could his position NOT be inconsistent to you ? To take your abortion example , it would be like someone saying they are for reproductive / abortion rights , but yet being against it being legal for women to get an abortion at an abortion clinic . Frankly , you're grasping at straws at this point .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>BUT THAT'S YOUR POSITION ... If you can't grasp that you are saying YOUR OWN POSITION is inconsistent , I don't know what to say . Yeah . You have no recollection of what my position actually is , do you . As I have already explained to you , I see that a person can be for gay rights and against gay marriage . I see that a person can propose a compromise , that I personally would find acceptable . I can't tell you how many people have posted " I don't believe gay marriage is a right " . If they also say " I believe gays should have equal rights " , THERE IS NO CONTRADICTION just cause I BELIEVE ( let me repeat that , I BELIEVE ) that gay marriage is a right . I think Biden's wrong . But HIS VIEW is consistent . On another note , I am just amazed that you think your own position is inconsistent . I honestly had no idea ... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Are you just not reading the thread ???? Apparently not . Let me repeat myself ... " In the sense that saying one supports gay rights but not gay marriage , sure . " I've ALREADY said I KNOW it's inconsistent , but that I DON'T CARE . It's not a pet issue for me . It is for you . Yet you're far more concerned , it seems , about the inconsistency on my part than on Biden's part . Yet it's BIDEN who's your candidate . Stop the dishonesty of pretending I haven't already addressed that .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Actually , I didn't think you had recognized what you had admitted . Next sentence you talked about Biden ... " more concerned " ? I am arguing against the general position . It doesn't matter who holds it . One of the points with Biden , as explained in multiple points before , is how the PERCEPTION of holding his feet to the fire could impact others ... If I could have a private one-on-one with Biden , or if he logged on anonymously to this web-site , I would discuss it with him just the same . Quite frankly , the " he's our candidate " thing is one of the things that takes precedent . See , we don't approach these things as " single issue " type guys . We weigh the " gay marriage opinion " up against the impact of pushing him hard on it a few weeks away from election day , and balance the responding approach accordingly . I hear somewhere that " single issue " guys can be frowned upon . That ain't us ...<br><b>S1:1-  </b>This is off-topic , but I do not see any forum on Supreme Court issues or constitutional interpretation generally . The New York Times has a little quiz to see how our views line up with those of the current Supreme Court and with the American public on various constitutional questions . Here is a link to the quiz : NY Times Advertisement Although I am liberal in my political views , my answers to the quiz questions indicate that I am in the center when it comes to constitutional questions .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What an awful quiz . It reinforces my point that people are making the court a second legislative body . If we want them to make decisions like this we are better off just having congress do it . At least they are voted in . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The problem with the quiz is that it just asks people's opinion about the issue ; it does not address the constitutional questions involved . The Supreme Court should not rule based on their opinions of the issue ; they should rule based on their interpretation of the constitution . The Supreme Court has ruled on the issues in the quiz , but their rulings should not have been based on what individual justices happen to think of guns or abortion .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>And the rulings shouldn't be considered " conservative " or " liberal " . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Right . Court rulings are interpretations of the constitution , and they are not , or should not be , expressions of the justices ' personal political beliefs . Even the NYTimes story saying that the Roberts court leans " conservative " does not really make sense , as " conservative " suggests a political viewpoint , not a philosophy of judicial interpretation .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Right , for example the ruling allowing corporations to run campaign ads or whatever was not really conservative ... pro corporation maybe but that doesn't necessary mean conservative ( perhaps more " republican " ) . Scalia actually goes around and does a speech where he gives examples of rulings he has made that upset both sides basically saying he doesn't care who he offends . Reading some of his opinions makes me believe he really doesn't care about offending people haha .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Hey - unlike some parasites around here who live off the service of others , I served Uncle Sam and fought for my freedom of speech right . If you don't like it you can take a hike . Sodom and Gomorrah liberals are a scourge to decent people everywhere . p.s. Did yo daddy plug da hole today ???<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Isn't it amusing that you say " I served Uncle Sam and fought for my freedom of speech right " , yet you don't think gays should be able to serve in the military nor do you think they should have freedom of speech . You said so right here : That's classy ! BTW Easy : You didn't fight for your right to free speech , you are guaranteed it by the constitution . ( unless you want to try to tell us that you fought in the revolutionary war ) The constitution applies to all Americans , even the gays . So if you don't want to abide by it or cannot accept that all Americans are indeed granted rights by the constitution , then perhaps it is you who should take a hike . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Why do you lie about what people have said ? They can serve and say whatever they want . But they need to stay in the closet or else they're out of here . There's consequences on earth and in the hereafter for the stiff-necked crowd . By the way , Did yo daddy plug da hole today ?? Did e ? ROTFLOL !<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Show me where I lied . This makes no sense . Obviously , they cannot say what ever they want , and if they say the wrong thing , they are kicked out . That is not freedom of speech . Why should there be consequences on earth , because you believe that it is wrong according to your religious book ? News flash for ya : Not everyone believes your religious book , and as such , not everyone feels obligated to abide by your book . Thankfully , you and your like-minded crowd of bigots are a dying breed . Right . Because that is all the oil spill in the gulf is to you ... a big joke . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If you don't know by now it won't help to point you there again . That's stupid . Being in denial has never stopped God's wrath before . Take another lap around Mt . Sinai , sport .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Again with no evidence of what you claim . I asked you to show me where I lied . I can give plenty of examples where you have ... Who said anything about being in denial ? I was asking why all Americans , even those like myself who believe your book to be nothing more than philosophical fiction , should be subject to your religious whims . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Do I look like I'm in charge of the country ? Quit your yapping . p.s. Any time you think you can document a New Testament person , place , or event as fiction , then hop out here . Otherwise you're about as believable as his highness , Obama .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Thankfully , no . However , you should understand that under our system of government , the power comes from the people . My fight is not against you specifically , but against bigots who feel that they can use their personal religious beliefs to dictate what others may or may not do . If you find yourself included in that category , then theres nothing I can do to help you . No , again Easy ... you fail the reading comprehension test . I used the word " believe " , not proof or evidence . Likewise , you believe in the NT , yet you cannot furnish any proof or evidence in support of it . I have no reason to justify my beliefs to you . You have no right to dictate your beliefs to me . Do you see the difference ? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>And who are you to decide what religious-minded people can and cannot do ? Seems like your personal bigotry is getting the better of you . And do you know that if enough Christians , Jews , and others decide to embrace and pass a Constitutional Amendment against , say , gay unions and gay marriages , that it's perfectly legal under our Constitution to do so , and that there's not a darn thing you can do about it ? If you don't like what's being sent your way in these forums you can call the liberal politically correct thought police and see if they can help you . p.s. Did yo hero , the Immaculate One ( Obama - mmm-mmm-mmm ) plug da hole today ?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Bull . She's saying I'm a scary person because of my beliefs , and I am so rigid in my thinking I am unable to hear other people's understanding of the truth . Wrong , Bennedict . I hear other people just fine ( so that was a lie ) , but when it comes to people saying other people are scary because they claim to know the truth , then that's an insult . Scary is what the flaming liberals are doing to America . Now , please answer the questions posed to you in my post # 140 ?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Your views are pretty scary to me , Easyrider , because your mind is closed to other people's perceptions of and views of truth . I find this scary , because you hold so rigidly to what you believe is the truth . You are not open to learning and change and growth , it seems . You may hear what other people say , but you do not listen to them . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Jesus Christ is the TRUTH , prof ( see John 14 : 6 ) , and some 70% of Americans recognize that . For you to basically insinuate that the majority of Americans are misguided and steeped in folly for claiming they know the truth is an elitist and arrogant position to take , and I categorically reject it .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I do not hear the majority of Americans claiming to know " the TRUTH . " Different Christians view truth and their understanding of truth differently from the way you do . You do not speak for all Christians , despite what you seem to think . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If they're born again Christians they know that Jesus is the TRUTH ( John 14 : 6 ) . All the rest are spiritually challenged .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Since Christians hold a variety of views about truth , I guess your claim that 70 percent of Americans believe as you do is not accurate .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>reading some of these posts , its absolutely sickening to see such bigotry . OPEN YOUR MINDS PEOPLE !!!!! not everyones going to be like you are , thats the beauty of humanity . i dont quite understand why people would take such efforts to bring frustration and unhappiness to other people . im from Canada everyone , come on up , youre always welcome !<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Thanks , but our ( Biblical Jews and Christians in America ) minds are open to the truth of God's Word . It's the homosexuals and their supporters who have closed their minds to God's admonitions against gay sex in the Bible . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>step out of the bible , God and religion for a moment and look at how youre treating people . thats all you gotta do .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Originally Posted by Easyrider : Thanks , but our ( Biblical Jews and Christians in America ) minds are open to the truth of God's Word . It's the homosexuals and their supporters who have closed their minds to God's admonitions against gay sex in the Bible . Why should I throw the Word of God in the trash for your political correctness ? I discarded that decades ago when I found the truth . Why don't you guys read the Bible , pray for deliverance , and get yourselves saved so you will know right from wrong and so you can go to heaven when you die ? I'm going to advise active gays to repent and receive Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior for the remission of their sins . They do that they can be happy for all eternity . You tell them their sin is ok and then they drop down into the Pit of Hell when they die and then they're miserable forever . So who's really looking out for their best interests ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>you disgarded ... political correctness ? ok ... i already know right from wrong . i figured it out myself by treating people with kindness and respect . do you honestly need to refer to a book in order to know what right is from wrong ( albeit a very nasty and malign book ) ? and if youre going to advise gays ( God help us ) , so will i . to all gays : being gay is a sin in the bible's terms , the same bible that says to stone children to death if they misbehave . so that leaves the bible out of a resource we can trust , just be the way you are and youll be happy enough . looking out for their best intersts ...... youre insulting them more like it .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Does that get them to heaven when they die ? You can be a believer in Jesus Christ and do the same thing but rescue people from an eternity of suffering . I'll let Thomas Jefferson answer you on that : " A more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have never seen ; it is a document in proof that I am a real Christian , that is to say , a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus " By the way , which doctrine of Jesus is " nasty " ? Got a scripture # on that ? Show me that in the New Testament , under the New Covenant ? Have you ever read the entire Bible ? They wind up in Hell your way . With friends like that who needs enemies ? I'd rather twinge their consciences and save their eternal souls .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Matt , this is getting ridiculous . You made an assertion that Republicans would send gays to concentration camps like the Germans did in the holocaust . Then you brought up a statement by Paul Cameron , as if Paul Cameron has anything to do whatsoever with Republican politics or leadership . Now if you'd linked someone in the Republican leadership saying those things , you might have something , but you didn't . Paul Cameron is a psychologist that has gone over the top at times with some of the things he's said about gays and has paid a price for it . He's a frequent target of the gay pride movement for demonization and because he didn't tow the line with the APA's political stances , they distanced themselves from him . I don't agree with everything he says either , for that matter . But regardless of his views , they aren't the Republican party talking ; the most you can say is that they are Paul Cameron talking . Well , sure -- anything COULD happen . A military coup COULD take place and we'd have martial law . A new ice age COULD start in the next year . An asteroid COULD be on its way to hit earth . But there's a big difference between possibility and likelihood .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Paul Cameron is the single most frequently quoted " expert " cited by the GOP in ALL their attempts to limit the rights of gay people . His " research " has been entered in the Congressional Record countless times . It really is astounding that anyone would have anything to do with him . Including you . What price ? Without his revolting beliefs and star-power , he'd be flipping burgers somewhere . Instead , he's raking in a fortune speaking to the " moral " groups you're constantly defending . He was dismissed from the group for conducting fraudulent research . Cameron talking ... GOP repeating . Seriously , jyoshu , the man called for extermination . How can you support him or cite him or defend him at all ?????? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>How can you not stay on point ? Unless Cameron is a part of the GOP leadeship , Matt is pulling some wild point out of his hat , saying that because someone who may not even be a republican hates gays , that republicans hate gays . I might as well have said that since John Lennon attacked religion , then Democrats hate religion . Yes , his comments are THAT ludicrous . This is not about Paul Cameron no matter how much you'd love to change the subject , it's about Matt's ridiculous generalizations and comments . Oh , and you need to get up with the times -- no national political party has used Cameron's information in a serious way in a long time . I'm sure you'll now be Googling to try and find Republican individuals out there on the internet citing Cameron , but that's not the party leadership or its platform . There is NO republican in leadership that would call for the extermination of gays , and you know it . Nor does the platform say so . So let's put that little lie to bed right now .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Sorry , Sir . Since you didn't stay on point , I thought others were just as free to wander . If Democratic legislators from sea to shining sea quoted Lennon's lyrics about " imagine no religion " at every session that talked about religious freedom , you might draw that conclusion , no ? Ooops . I thought it was about a conservative Democrat in Minnesota bragging about " inside information " from that state's Supreme Court . Uh ... how about the President of the United States ??? http://www.boston.com/news/nation/wa...w_think_tanks/ Paul Cameron's research is cited in virtually every single attack on gay people in state after state after state legislature . It was presented in the " debate " about same-sex marriage in the U.S. friggin ' Senate . His name appears in the citations of virtually every legal brief filed by opponents of same-sex marriage . I think he even made it into Lawrence v . Texas . The man is president of the Family Research Institute . He can probably phone up ol ' Dubya anytime he gets the urge . And Dubya will put down his pretzel and pick up the phone . What should be put to bed is Paul Cameron and every single bogus study related to him . That supposedly reasonable people would even mention his name is surprising . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Ok , I now realize something I didn't earlier -- that you're obviously a DNC shill . NO one else would make such a ridiculous generalization . You really do think that's all conservatives talk about , huh ? I hate to bust your bubble , but it's not . I know your martyr complex is important to you , but it's just not accurate . ( shrug )<br><b> S2:3-  </b>What are you talking about ? I said you'd probably be right to assume that some people were anti-religion if they consistently talked about what a wonderful world it would be without it ? Over and over . At every opportunity . And never had a single nice word to say about it . Ever . You really are laughable when you try to defend the GOP when one of their admittedly most effective propaganda campaigns is to rally the " family-values " crowd against gay rights . IT'S OPENLY ADMITTED BY THEM . They're PROUD of their tactics . Very odd ...<br><b>S1:1-  </b>We don't just benefit from what is often considered the common , nuclear family . We benefit from families with adopted children , step children , families with no children at all . No it does not . Prove it will come up , and also prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . Marriage is that now . You're right , it has nothing to do with the Bible . It has everything to do with the slippery slope logical fallacy , which we've discussed in the forum ad nauseum . It only shows that those opposed do not have an argument . You know the prospect of incest and polygamy is much less socially acceptable than gay marriage , so you try to erroneously tie polygamy and incest to gay marriage in people's mind to strike fear in them , and hope their logical reasoning can be replaced by irrational fear .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>a married couple as the head of a home is considered a nuclear family it already has . the question of legality is what this whole issue is about . marriage is a legal instituation , how could legality NOT come up . yes it is whoa ... hold up ... are you saying that only because gay marriage is less unacceptable that incestuous relations , that its ok to grant gay marriage but not sibling marriage ?? if the incestuous society begin to parade and protest , until society accepts them on the level that they accept gays now , what will you say then ? on what grounds should we discriminate against 2 siblings wanting to get married , particularly if they believe they truly love each other , or if they believe that they were born with that attraction ? this is classic hypocracy . if 2 siblings want to love each other in their private lives , how is that any business of yours ? and what does irrational fear have to do with anything ? do you have an irrational fear of an incestuous or polygamous lifestyle ? based on what ? give me one reason why society shouldnt accept an incestuous relation between two consenting adults <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Then what may lead to incest and polygamy is the fact that marriage is a legal institution , is that what you are saying ? If so , these things may come up equally as a result of straight legal marriage or gay legal marriage or interracial legal marriage , or legal inter-faith marriage or legal marriage with legal divorce , etc. It doesn't relate specifically to gay legal marriage at all . I was saying this is how many people attempt an argument against gay marriage , by attempting to incite fear by spouting off a parade of horribles that have nothing to do with the issue of gay marriage . What if straight people are married and winged green monkeys come flying out of everyone's derriere in the future ? What will you do then ? Demonstrate how gay marriage specifically relates to incest and incestuous marriage and polygamy . This is the gay rights forum , not the incest forum .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>thats not what im saying . what may lead to incestuous marriage is if siblings or related people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . and what may lead to polygamous marriage is 3 or more people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . do you see a pattern here ? ooooh .. nice way to snake out of the issue ... let me refresh your memory since you brought it up , what exactly does the social acceptance of any type of " taboo " relationship have to do with their right to be legally married ? is there a certain limit of " tabooness " , and if youre past that limit then no marriage for you ? and what fear are you talking about ? i'm talking about people that love each other and want to tie the knot . how could that possibly strike fear in somebody ? please .... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yes , that's true . Yes , that's true . Are you saying love is the pattern ? Well , love applies to straight marriages as well as gay marriages . Love is not exclusive to gay marriages . If that's the connection , we can just as easily say straight marriage will lead to incestuous marriage and polygamy . You are saying love will cause a slippery slope . It's still fallacious . The issue I brought up was why this fallacy is often used , that is to create fear , because incest and polygamy are indeed considered so taboo . The issue is not the tabooness of anything and everything , but how it is being used to distract from the issue of same-sex marriage , when there isn't a logical , rational argument against same-sex marriage . It's an indication of desperation on the part of some of those who are against same-sex marriage . I have no reason to discuss the level of acceptability or lack thereof of every single thing , before I accept one thing that is different from all those other things . I can deal with that one thing on all of its own merits and shortfalls , without being drawn into a false dilemma , either accept everything or else don't accept one thing , as if those are the only two choices , fallacy .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>gay marriage will change the definition of marriage from " a legal union between a man and a woman " to " a legal union between any parties that love each other " . if its ok for 2 people that love each other and want to tie the knot , then how could incest be a taboo ? based on what ? again with the double standard . gay marriage was considered just as much a taboo as incest or polygamy just a few years ago . being gay emerged from its taboo status through parades , promotional efforts , and , unfortunately , by spreading lies ( i'll deal with that in another thread ) . however , incestuous people didnt go through the process of parading their lifestyle in front of the world and practically begging for approval from society . so incest is still deeper in taboo status than homosexuality . why is it ok to deny incestuous relations the right to marry on the grounds that it is considered taboo , but ok to approve gay marriage on the same grounds ?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>.... and certainly what Jefferson was recommending be done to homosexuals is not OK .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>But he was right about homosexual sex being a sin / crime . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>According to your faith it is a sin . According the laws at the time it may have been a crime . Its not anymore .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It is in my mind . There ought to be a stiff-wallet clearing fine on the behavior , and on those who advocate it . It's a perversion of nature and a sin against God . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So ? You don't live in a theocracy , sunshine . If you don't like the freedom that exists here ( which includes your freedom to practice your intolerant version of your faith ) there are other places you can go live . You do not get to force the responsibility of appeasing your God on the population as a whole . No worries , I am sure you will go to heaven anyway .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Along with the failed liberal concept of equality is the mantra of liberal    tolerance .    However , liberal tolerance is not what it appears to be . It is a contradictory , partisan philosophical perspective with its own rigid set of dogmas . It assumes , for instance , a relativistic view of moral and religious knowledge . This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality , abortion rights , and religious truth claims , leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs . But this posture is often dogmatic , intolerant , and coercive , for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues , and if one does not embrace it , one may likely face public ridicule , demagogic tactics , and perhaps even legal reprisals . Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant . That's you , Jito-baby . We voted against illicit gay sex marriage where I live and we won . Eat your heart out , O ye who call good evil , and evil , good . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I know . Its so so so sad how your Christians are so so so persecuted every time you can't make all of us follow the rules of your chosen religion . How do you manage ? I mean , it would be different if all those " liberal " laws and all that " liberal " tolerance would at least allow you to practice your religion as you see fit ..... a wait , um , they do .... Whatever o ye who speaks with his rectum and defecates with his mouth .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You do know that the gay marriage debate is not synonymous with someone condoning violence against gays , right ? I seriously doubt anyone here doesn't agree with you that gays shouldn't experience violence and name-calling , so that's not even an issue on the table here . Disagree and debate those who believe gay marriage is wrong all you want . But don't dishonestly use arguments about violence , because no one here has argued for that .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I'm sorry , but have you READ ARCHIE'S POSTS ??? He regularly denigrates gays with a variety of slurs . And Palin never asked for somebody to threaten Obama either . But her rhetoric INFLAMED people to extremes that are grotesque . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Oh please . Don't start that subjective canard again . If every religious person who genuinely disagreed with gay marriage because of their religion added a ' but-no-violence ! ' addendum to everytime they weighed in on it , do you think anyone actually thinks you'd be satisfied ? Um ... no . it's funny how the whole violence thing gets used as a means-to-an-end tool by those who argue against religious people on this . Well , it would be funny if it weren't sad to some extent . People shouldn't have to stop standing up for their principles just because of nutcases out there .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If the shoe fits ... I'm talking about the people who proclaim abusive lies about gays . People who put out junk that makes people feel threatened by gays . Telling people that gay marriage will makes their kids have to be taught about gay marriage ? That's a threat . Telling people that gay marriage will require churches to have to perform gay marriages ? That's perceived as a threat too . I have no doubt that SOME people can discuss the subject without inciting . But on the Prop 8 battle , the ads clearly WERE inciteful . Do you think that if a person talks about an abortion doctor " killing babies " , that doesn't push somebody to think about claiming " self-defense " or " defense of others " ? How many people do you think are out there that have attacked a gay person that actually had somebody tell them " I think you should go out and kill a gay person " ? It's built up toxicity from all the anti-gay rhetoric that reaches a boiling point . When the rhetoric inflames , it's obvious where it starts when somebody gets burned ... Oh . And can I just say that while I am impressed you didn't try to attack me , you're doing a bad job of ignoring me ... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yeah , WHEN it fits . Not other contexts . Jason didn't make that distinction which is why I took issue with him on it . I didn't say I was going to start ignoring you , Foundit . I made clear I was done with that discussion . I did NOT say I was going to stop responding to you Foundit . And regarding your comment about ' attacking ' , it's because your tone has changed in the last few posts -- you've turned off the hostility some , for whatver reason , and it's the nature of things that honey draws less flies than **** . That's why you no longer perceive as being " attacked . " Quite simply , you require a fight-fire-with-fire approach , and so tone you are treated with ( from me , anyway ) depends entirely on you .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>And considering he was responding to ARCHIE , one of the guys who has got the worst track record on this message board for abusive slurs towards gays , I think he was right on track . Oh . Silly me . So that was just a lame attempt to dodge THAT conversation then . The one where I had just finished explaining how you were moving the goal-posts and obfuscating up a storm . I guess " CLAFCLO " was more successful than I thought . It's amusing to watch you turn on your passive-aggressive claims , and then turn them off again . When you need it as an excuse , you'll start whining about " attacks " again , even as you drop claims that I shouldn't be a moderator of any board ... Which I'm sure isn't an " attack " or " personal information " in your book , hmmm ? And also , your response here is doing exactly what I noted on the other thread . You're dropping the majority of the topical text , and making more of an interest in that ONE side-note comment ... <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I said NAMECALLING and VIOLENCE , Foundit . Those were the things Jason conflated with opposing gay marriage . Once again you're being disingenuous again -- respond to what I actually SAID for once . Show where Archie has ever called gays names before , like the f word , or called for violence against gays . If you can , I'll be glad to retract the comment . Namecalling and violence are wrong , REGARDLESS of where people fall on the issue of gay marriage . In fact , more importantly , they're always wrong no matter what the issue . Whatever you want to think , Foundit . It's not worth arguing over with a brick wall . Geeez Foundit . I suspect personal comments about posters are starting to compete or even outnumber pertinent points about issues you're making at this point . I think I'm going to start using an acronymn whenever you do so , that says Personal Comments & Attacks Don't Deal with Issues . " PCADDWI " . That way it will be noted when you do it , but it allow you to continue dragging down the thread with them . ( Or at least you'll be completely alone in doing so . ) PCADDWI .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Quote him . Quote EXACTLY what he said . Cause Jason did no such thing ... Were you looking in the mirror when you said that ? Are you for real ? We've already got Archie's " bitchy as a gay " comment . I never said he called gays " XXXXXX " before . But ain't it interesting how this board will sensor ###### or #### , but if you say XXXXXX , it's A-OK ... The fact that you argue with me on so many issues , but then throw this arbitrary argument out there , belittles your claim and demonstrates an ulterior motive for ignoring the statement . Are you going to label your own statements as such Jyoshu ? Cause you have this boring habit of starting passive-aggressive attacks , belittling other people , and then when somebody calls you on it or says something about it you eventually drop it and act surprised when other people point out you dropped it .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>All the proponents of Prop 8 need to do is verify that the State Constitutional Amendment banning gay marriage was enacted legally . PERIOD !!!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Do you not understand what is currently going on ? The ruling on whether the California state constitutional amendment was enacted " legally " was ruled on by the courts . What is discussed above is entirely separate . To say something brief to get you up to speed , our state constitution CANNOT violate the federal constitution . So if Prop 8 violates the 14th amendment , then Prop 8 loses . Whether or not Prop 8 violates the 14th amendment is the question that is currently being examined . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>If DOMA isn't declared unconstitutional , then those arguing against Prop 8 are micturating into the wind .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Oh dear God your ignorance is abundant ! Do you not understand what the federal DOMA law does ? Defense of Marriage Act - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia This very discussion could very well lead to the recognition that the federal DOMA itself is unconstitutional . And as for the state DOMA , this discussion is EXPLICITLY saying that it violates the federal constitution . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It has a financial impact on ALL taxpayers . To say that it has no impact on anyone else is disengenuous . Wow ! You can read Wiki's pseudo-knowledge . I'm impressed ! Now , tell me how the court can rule a California Constitutional Amendment to be unconstitutional before it strikes down the Federal Law that gives states the FEDERAL right to ignore other state's gay marriages .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Actually , such an " impact " is obviously to be disregarded for a very basic and obvious reason . Gays pay taxes just like straight people . So why should gays have to pay for straight relationship marriages , why our own gay relationships are precluded . To try to bring up the impact " on ALL taxpayers " , without recognizing that gays ALREADY PAY for straight marriages ourselves , is rather disingenuous . Actually , I was just trying to dumb it down for you ... Yeah . I knew you were going to fail miserably there ... LOOK at the DOMA ruling . Does it say ANYTHING that actually prohibits a state from ruling that THAT STATE has to recognize gay marriage with respect to the 14th amendment ? No . If you had bothered to read and THINK about what I was showing you , you would realize that the conundrum you THINK exists doesn't actually exist . There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in federal DOMA which prevents a California court from ruling that the 14th amendment requires gay marriage . Furthermore , if you actually THOUGHT it did , something fundamentally wrong should strike you ... The legislature SHOULD NEVER presume to restrict a court's ruling on constitutional interpretation based on a simple law .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Dead " potential " lives don't have " real " or " actual " dead bodies . When a pre-birth child dies ( either naturally or by the hands of a ' doctor ' paid to kill it ) , ... it has a ' real ' body . Not just a mere potential for one . There are plenty of photos and such on the net if you really need more convincing evidence . But if you ever want to debate it further , feel free to join me in the appropriate threads .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Are you finished trying to troll this thread yet for people to talk to you about abortion ? I am half tempted to start playing devil's advocate and adopt YOUR positions against gay rights here as a means to respond to you on abortion issues in the other threads . You would lose abortion arguments by the arguments you have raised here ... Food for thought . Couple a " general welfare " claim with the research that shows abortion has caused lower crime ... By your position , and by blindly repeating " general welfare " over and over again without addressing anything , not much you would be left with ... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I'll take that debate . Anytime .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Oh . I recognize what you WANTED your point to be ... I also recognize how you flubbed up stating what you wanted to say ... And that's where you went beyond being insulting . It's like trying to argue that the abortionists could have no qualms exterminating Jews in another Holocaust . You should at least be honest enough to admit the boundaries that DO exist , unilaterally . And by that logic , I could just as easily argue that those people who wanted to prevent gay marriage could just as easily want to prevent inter-religious or inter-racial marriage ... They could supposedly just as easily have wanted slavery back , if they're willing to deny people rights because of their differences ... If I thought you would learn anything meaningful to you from such a discussion , I would take you up on it ... But as it is , I've come to recognize your posting patterns enough to question how much you recognize the fallibility of your own tactics ... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>At least we can agree on that much . I doubt you could learn anything ; also ! Hey ,.. . Will Maine's results have any bearing on the SCOTUS look at overturning the 9th ( again ) ? Ya think ?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>See , that's part of the problem . That's not an issue we agree on . But you don't recognize that ... Why should it ? The " 9th " is about how the FEDERAL CONSTITUTION applies to gay marriage . Maine's results were about how voters feel about gay marriage . Two entirely separate issues ... While I recognize the following will be lost on you , I offer it anyways ... Bowers    rationale does not withstand careful analysis . In his dissenting opinion in Bowers Justice Stevens concluded that ( 1 ) the fact a State    s governing majority has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice , and ( 2 ) individual decisions concerning the intimacies of physical relationships , even when not intended to produce offspring , are a form of    liberty    protected by due process . LAWRENCE V. TEXAS The fact that a majority want a law is not enough to satisfy a constitutional challenge of that law . That much should be obvious . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>No ,.. seriously .... I doubt you would learn ( accept , consider , absorb , aquire ) anything from such a debate . But , you're welcome to try to prove me wrong about that . California's ban ( being reviewed by the 9th ) is likewise about " the voters " and their desired definition . See what I mean that it's doubtful that you will learn anything from another exchange ? You don't need to bother with an answer to that . I already know what it is likely to be .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>See , this is why I doubt your intellectual honesty in discourse . What you said was actually pretty witty , assuming it wasn't done by accident . But you still choose to employ those faculties for furthering flawed arguments , and dodging arguments you know you cannot win . So you blindly repeat yourself , and think I have learned nothing . They are two entirely separate issues . But you pointing to issue A DOES NOT REFUTE issue B. THAT is where you are flawed . It doesn't matter how much " desire " the voters have . Their law STILL has to be constitutional and meet the requirements of the 14th amendment . And until you can embrace an honestly open discussion on that , without repeating yourself ad nausieum like a skipping record player , there is no point in enjoining you on another subject .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Same sex marriage ( whether it negatively impacts typical marriages or not ) isnot the same essential component to the basic structure of our " general " welfare that one man one woman marriage is . Sorry , but it just isn't .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yes it is . Gay couples and families have the same needs , responsibilities to one another and society , as well , despite your desire to marginalize and exclude . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You are being a bit pretentious here ; in that you don't know anything about my desires . More to the point , you ignored what I had actually said and instead responded to what you " assumed " I ment . QUOTE ; " Same sex marriage ( whether it negatively impacts typical marriages or not ) is not the same essential component to the basic structure of our " general " welfare that one man one woman marriage is . " Our society can survive without homosexual unions , polygamy , beastiality etc. I doubt very much our society would survive very long at all without heterosexual marriage . Making sense yet ?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I know what you meant . Marriage is straight , gays are excluded . It's made up of the same components . Only the sexes of the partners is different . No . Our society could survive without allowing many minorities the same rights as the majority . That's not an argument . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Gay ,.. . do you agree that ( we the people ) through government have the right to draw the line ' somewhere ' between what we will and what we will not recognize as ' marriage ? ' ( again , think incest , polygamy , statutory , etc. ) If You do agree that the government has the right to draw the lines somewhere .... then all we have is a disagreement on where the lines should be drawn . There's no need to make it more than what it is .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well , no , I don't think I was making it more than it is . You said society could go on without gay marriage . The only reason for that I can figure , is that gays are a minority . Red herrings such as the laundry list you trot out , aren't an argument in support of the issue at hand , which is banning gay marriage . You're going to have to come up with another argument . Yes , we do have a disagreement where the lines should be drawn . Now , please make your argument for drawing them in such a way that precludes same-sex marriage . You don't have one , do you ?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>We all know the possibility exists . I simply haven't seen anyone present any even half way convincing argument that any of those possibilities are , in fact , a reality . All you're saying is " They say it's morals " which is no argument at all . Calling a tail a leg , etc.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Furthermore , why do you start with the premise that it's prejudice , rather than needing proof of that ( instead expecting proof of a negative -- that it's not ) ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I didn't start with that premise , it's simply the most likely answer . I know of no moral system that condones hurting others when said harm isn't preventing some other harm , so morals are out . Religion is a good reason for choosing your own actions but it's no reason for telling others how to live , so that's out . Prejudice against gays has been around for ages , so that's quite likely . And no other explanations come to mind . Straight forward . I'm sure I've explained this to you before , and have invited you to come up with alternate explanations . I do so again . I'm particularly interested to see your response now that you seem to have gotten over the idea that simply calling something moral or religious does not mean that it can't be prejudice at the same time .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>And neither does Christianity . It TOO is a moral system . That's why when people claim religion in their acts of prejudice , they are actually abandoning that moral system , rather than engaging in it . So yes , morals are out -- I'm glad you're seeing that now . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So you finally see that people can claim a moral or religious stance while not actually having one ? Excellent ! Glad to hear it . Now , care to address the matter at hand ? Can you show me , preferably in reality as opposed to a hypothetical , how one could justify pushing an anti-gay agenda based on actual morals or religion ? Because I've never seen it myself .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Nice attempt at trying to refute a point that hasn't even been made here . The matter at hand is that prejudice may in fact not be what's behind people's opposition to gays being in romantic relationships . In some cases ( well , I'd say MANY cases ) it's religious belief , which may be separate from prejudice . The people I've been around who fel that way were doing it because of their religious beliefs . In fact , it's MY reason as well . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Actually it was my point . You've refused to acknowledge this so many times in the past that I couldn't even count . I'm glad you're past it now . Fine , than if it's your reasoning than spell it out for me . Don't worry about anyone else's reasoning , just give me yours . Take me , step by step , from " this is my religious belief " to " therefore other people shouldn't be gay ( or act gay or whatever ) " . Leave nothing out , spell out your assumptions , give me the whole ball of wax . Because in all my years I've never once seen anyone come close to doing so without resorting to prejudice . For bonus points extend it all the way to " and so public policy disadvantageous to gays should be enacted " .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I have NEVER said that people can't claim to have a moral belief and not really have one . People can conceivably lie about anything -- we can't base our discussion on the worry that people might be lying about their stance ; that could be the case in ANY situation about ANY issue . No , it's a religious belief . There's no more " reasoning " to it than believing in faith that Christ is a ressurected being . I believe it because it's Biblical -- it's what the Bible says . That's WHY I believe people shouldn't do it . It's not so complicated , really . No one is saying YOU have to believe that way . But it is the way I believe , and that's my business . If I imposed my beliefs , that would be one thing , but I don't . I don't impose anything on you or anyone else , nor do I want to . Get it ? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>And yet I can't see how you made that jump . You believe , fine . But why shouldn't other people do it ? What do your beliefs have to do with other people's actions ? So you don't impose ? You don't take any action which could have an obvious negative impact on another person based solely on your religious beliefs ? If that's true than I have no problem with you , and you're not one of the people I'm talking about here . I did specify people pushing an anti-gay agenda after all . Are you saying that the people in " Focus on the Family " , or whatever they're called , are in fact doing wrong then ? Since they are clearly trying to impose their views on others , which you and I seem to agree is wrong .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Don't you think that in 1909 it was probably viewed mostly from a moral standpoint ? I don't think they saw it the same way they would see black people . They didn't even realize that ' homosexuality ' was any sort of innate thing . It was entirely behavioral to them . I tend to agree with the court , even given what you've said . I doubt for 1909 it was about prejudice and bigotry -- they genuinely felt it was wrong . The concept of gay marriage was completely foreign and unknown in 1909 . It wasn't even something they conceived of . I think the court is saying that they couldn't have been prejudiced against something they didn't even know of or conceive of .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Hogwash . It was once entirely moral to believe certain races were inferior , and that women had fewer rights than men . Treating the races and women as equal was not something even thought of by many . It was prejudice against gays then , and it still is today . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>This is not really true . It's a popular misconstruing of morality and history by proponents of modern ' rights ' movements , but it's not true . There's little historical backing to the idea that people believed oppressing black people was a right thing to do , as in , doing good . There were times they used an argument where religion was wrongly used to justify their behavior , but that's a different matter . If you firmly believe otherwise , I'd challenge you to show where people thought oppressing blacks was an example if doing good . The same goes for misogyny . Furthermore , it's beside the point anyway . We're talking about homosexuality . In 1909 , the only thing they really understood about the issue at hand was that some people engaged in sexual relations with people of their own gender . There were no articles about " homosexuality " as a trait , and certainly none about genetic causes . It was understood entirely from a behavioral standpoint , and therefore a moral standpoint . So it's not hogwash at all -- they really did view gay sex as immoral . If you don't think so , then you have a very poor grasp on history in this case .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This kind of morality is based on nothing but ignorance ( which you admit ) and prejudice . What kind of a basis is that for a so-called moral code ? So what if it involves behaviour ? Gay people have sex , develop relationships , and bond , just like everyone else , but in a way that reflects their gay sexuality . This does not mean people could not be prejudiced about the way gay people live . People were , and are so prejudiced . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>A better reverse analogy would have been to say " So then conversly I have the right to advocate that heterosexual relations are morally wrong " . Not heterosexuality , since it's not homosexuality ( as it's a state of being ) that religious people have a problem with . Heck , they often don't even recognize it . With that caveat , yes you are certainly free to advocate whatever you want to be morally wrong . ( And unlike the way some in your movement do , I won't call you a " bigot " for doing so ! ) It may have been based on " ignorance " , but I reject the notion it was based on prejudice ( and therefore I tend to agree with the 6 - 0 view of the justices here ) . The 1909 society had too little understanding of gay people to be prejudiced over in the first place . Remember , homosexuality was not understood as a state of being at that time . The term itself had not been around long and was not known to most people . And even to those it was known to , it was not known as a state of being . And there certainly was no social identity among gay people as a group -- how could prejudice have existed if there was nothing ( from their perspective ) to be prejudiced toward ?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Right . Provided gays don't live gay , but live straight , gays can be as gay as they want . As long as gays don't outwardly show what makes them different from straights , gays can be as gay as they want . It's bs . Also some may not recognize the existence of gay people or their gay lives , but that is putting one's head in the sand . Nonsense . People would widely and hatefully use the term " sodomite " to refer to gays . Before that the term was " molly " . Clearly there was an identity they were prejudiced towards . They were rounding up gays in areas they were known to attend , and putting them in prison . Read up on the trial of Oscar Wilde . Gays may have been forced underground , to a greater extent , but that does not mean they were not thought of . Gays were just not thought of in a nice way . Gays were purposely kept out of everything in society , when society didn't really think of gays as human too . That isn't prejudice ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Because they didn't approve of sodomy ! Do you not agree they didn't understand the concept of homosexuality ??? There was no social identity . When they were put on trial , it wasn't because they were gay ( which they had no concept of ) , it was because they had gay relations which society viewed as wrong ! No , here's where you don't get it -- it's not that " gays " ( there was no concept of that ) were purposely kept out of of everything , it's that people who had sodomy relationships were kept out of everything , because sodomy was viewed as wrong . They really did think it was wrong ! You are so determined to portray everything that has anything to do with gay relations possibly being wrong as prejudice and bigotry that you are close-minded about it .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You wish . But however much I disagree with Sullivan on many political issues , he's right about that . The world did change when the Mass . legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights . It may be a big change in a small state , but it is a recognition that the winds of change are blowing against homophobic bigotry . You are just going to have to get over it . The world just isn't as anti-gay as it used to be . And that means that you are going to have to accept equal rights eventually , as gay marriage . Presumably you will hope than in a few years , bigots in Massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality . I think you'll be out of luck .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You wish that I wish . Do you just like to argue for the sake of being argumentative ? You've picked out the one single thing I said there that you could disagree with and are making an issue of it , not even willing to agree on anything else I said . But fine , go ahead and think this is some world-changing event if it makes you feel better . Well , clearly you didn't even read my post . ( shrug ) <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You have often posted here that you oppose gay marriage . That means you oppose equal rights for gays . If you have changed your mind , and hope that Massachusetts doesn't overturn gay marriage , you would have said so . Since you didn't , you don't .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No , you said you I " will hope than in a few years , bigots in Massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality " . I had said , very plainly , that I think such legislation is an over-intrusion by the government . Clearly you didn't read my post . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Are you claiming now you are in favour of legal marriage for gays in Massachusetts now the legislature has voted for it ? Because if so , that would be a change .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I'm saying that I would not want an amendment put in place banning it , because that would be an over-intrusion into peoples ' lives by the government . So naturally , I wouldn't want such an amendment voted into creation , either , and that's why I took issue with your claim that I would . That's been my position here for as long as I remember . And it's a true conservative position ( as opposed to neocon ) , BTW . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Are you saying that you are not in favour of a government ban on gay marriage ? You oppose DOMA laws ? Does that mean you are now , contrary to your previous posts , in favour of legal recognition of gay marriage ?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Any two adults can run the household , one can make the decision if the other is incapacitated , one inherits when the other dies , etc etc. That parallel does not carry over to group marriages . When one dies , who inherits ? If one is incapacitied , who decides what the treatment should be ? Basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two , so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task , and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious . If we're talking about legal recognition , and we are ( right ? ) , then the cases are wildly different . Our marriage laws , for better or worse , are set up on the assumption of two adults running a household . They also assume man and wife , true , but don't actually depend on that . But the dependence on there being two people is embedded in the laws ; changing that is a huge project .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yes , but gays would also want laws changed to accomodate THEIR form of marriage as well . The fact that one requires less change than the other shouldn't matter , should it ? Should having to do more reworking of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality ? It seems to me your argument boils down to " polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it . " Yeah -- such is the price for marriage equality . Let's face it -- if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for opposite-sex couples which comprise most relationships , they could pull it off -- polygamy , gays , letting 17 year olds marry , etc. All those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed . Means could be set up to determine inheritance , for example . Laws can be worded to do it . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>See , this is why we try to avoid this debate . Those who oppose gay marriage inevitably put their own spin on it and drag it to silly conclusion . Here we see what gays really want turned into " make marriage an open-ended institution of equality " , which then means gay , poly , and 17 year olds in this case . Jyoshu stopped there , but it's not uncommon for it then to go to children , cousins , dogs , whatever . This issue is not " let's let everyone do anything they like " , that's just the common reframing we see whenever poly relations are brought up while disscusing gay marriage . It happens all the time , it gets old , and that's why people who have gone through it a bunch of times tend to aviod the whole thing .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It happens because there's no way to avoid logical conclusions . Believe it or not , cultural and legal precedent is a very real thing . The events in the article exemplify this . If you argue to broaden marriage ( which you are ) , then this is what you have to deal with . As you said , I DID stop with polygamy , gay , and barely lowering the age of consent , so why are YOU bringing up all the other examples like " children , cousins dogs , " or whatever , as if you were ready to pounce on that ? You're arguing against degrees that I didn't even say , or that NO one said . Now , do you have any response to my point that your argument boils down to nothing more than " polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it " , or are you just going to avoid it by getting sidetracked by the fact you don't like that we're even talking about this ? Again , society can deal with issues like polygamy if they really want to . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Sure there is . You can start with an erroneous assumption , like you did , and then arrive at an illogical conclusion , like you did . Why don't you read the exchanges between me and Phyllis ; I think most of your issues will be addressed that way .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Do you feel that opening marriage to gay couples is not a case of broadening marriage ? How is that an erroneous assumption ? Sure , but I asked you some specific questions that you seem to be avoiding . In your exchange with Phyllis I may comment on matters I disagree with . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Listen to yourself ! We start with " gays want to get married " , you change it to " make marriage an open-ended institution of equality " , and now you segue over to " broadening marriage " . Your erroneous assumption is your statement of what gays are trying to accomplish . Until you stop trying to change what gays really want into something that you can argue against more easily all your arguments will be based on erroneous assumptions . Actually , I did address them . While debating with Phyllis . Naturally . And naturally I may ignore them if I think they are diversions .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>What gays are trying or not trying ( in terms of intent ) is not the issue . What is the crux here is that marriage would be broadened . It's not rocket science . You're moving the boundaries of what constitutes a marriage to include MORE than opposite-sex couples . Very straightforward . I know you don't like it phrased that way , but that's what it is . You can't take a phrase like ' gays want to get married " without looking at the overall implications . In terms of legal rights , I don't see why it would be any different . Equality in marriage is equality in marriage regardless of the cultural motivation -- religious , being in love with more than one person , or simply just for the hell of it . For that matter , the argument could be made that opposite-sex marriage between 2 people is largely a religious construct ! <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I'll try to explain this to you one more time . The stated purpose of gays is quite relevent if you are trying to argue against it . Gays want to get married . One side effect of that is that some people will see the scope of marriage broadened . Gays are not , in and of itself , trying to broaden marriage . They did not wake up one day and say " let's try to broaden the scope of marriage today , that'll be fun ! " Your arguments run along the lines of " If you want to braoden marriage , than you must excpet it broadening in all these other ways " and that's why your rephrasing doesn't work . Broadening marriage isn't the goal , it's a side effect , and since it isn't the goal we don't have to accept all these other things you claim would be the result if they were trying to broaden marriage . To recap , your arguments are based on your assumption that gays want to broaden marriage , that that is their ulitmate goal , the pinnacle of the cause . Gays getting married to you seems to be the means to that end . That is , of course , backwards , and so your sematic based arguments fail .<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Kronos , I just told you I am not dealing here with what gays are trying / not trying to do in terms of intent , yet you are are arguing as if I never even said that . I am not arguing what gays have as intent . I completely understand what you are saying . My point here is based on the effect of their intents , whatever that intent is . There is simply no way to get around the fact that if you change marriage to include other that opposite-sex couples ( to ANY number of other possibilities -- even ONE ) , you are broadening marriage . Whether or not gays set out out to do this in terms of a goal is irrelevant . You are attacking some point about intent that I haven't made -- I'm talking about the effect here . To latch onto some straw man of " intent " is to completely miss the point . <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I'm not ignoring this post , I'm simply choosing not to respond because it's a pointless distraction in an otherwise interesing thread . If you want to start another thread on this theme I'll explain there how wrong you are .<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Well , you're the one that's taking issue and making it a distraction !<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Withers : DC Council votes for gay marriage By James Withers , contributing editor , 365 Gay Blog 12.15.2009 3:32 pm EST In a 11 - 2 vote , the City Council of Washington , DC voted for gay marriage . We are a bit short-handed today , so expect more about this later . Until then have a sip of the bubbly and congrats to the District .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Wait until it's put on a ballot for the voters to decide . This isn't the first time that a liberal government didn't pay attention to the will of the people . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>And what is the will of the people JP ? People in support of marriage equality is steadily growing . Compare the polls from ten years ago to now to see ... It is only a matter of time before equality stands upon the side of the majority .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I keep hearing gays say that but every time it's put to a vote , you lose . I'd say that it's time to try another tact because the current one is a losing proposition . The only thing forcing gay marriage on a population does is galvanize them against the forced action . And when they respond on the ballot , they do so punatively . Just wait until you see the repercussions of the current efforts to give ALL Federal Employee's same sex partners bennies on OUR DIME despite DOMA . I'm guessing that some additional Democratic heads will roll in the fall election if that flies . You need a PR strategy that highlights the advantages of gay unions over bathhouse and gay bar existences . I believe that a true majority of people would support civil unions but NOT marriage . And I count myself amongst that majority . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Actually JP so far 5 states have passed gay marriage so no not every time it is put to a vote do we lose . And how am I forcing anyone to accept gay marriage ? Am I forcing these voters to attend my wedding or dare I say be in a marriage themselves ? And I cannot agree with you more about changing the image of the gay community as a whole .. We are not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people running around ... What I find funny is once strait people find out how boring we really are , and how we pay taxes just like every other joe schmo they'll think nothing more of special rights lol ... But actually like I stated earlier in another thread if those unions constituted the same legal rights as married couples I would be content .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Which 5 states put gay marriage on the ballot and it won ? To the best of my knowledge , no state that has gay marriage today has ever gotten it via the ballot . It has either been the court or legislature that has forced it on the state . The gays I know are as boring as Mr and Mrs John Q. Public as well , but that's not the image that is portrayed to the general public . Like I said , you have a PR problem . I think that if more gays were willing to settle for civil unions that were more equivalent to marriage , you'd have an easier time gaining legal acceptance . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Ok maybe not the ballot ... Got me there man . Lol .... Maine was a close one though . And yeah we got a MAJOR PR problem big time ... And I said as long as we got the legal rights of marriage and called it CU I would be cool with that . I already wear a dress and heels enough as it is ! lmao jk ....<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I hope that you , at least , shave your legs . ;) <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Oh I do ... lmao naw I don't wear a dress I wouldn't look good in one ...<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I believe someone brought up the Australian situation , conserning a gay marriage ban . Here is an update ... ABC Online ...... " The National Party will be out campaigning on this issue because we believe the conservative people of Australia want marriage defined as between a man and a woman , " he said . Senator Boswell has accused the Democrats and other senators of trying to desecrate the institution of marriage .   2004 Australian Broadcasting Corporation Copyright information : http://abc.net.au/common/copyrigh.htm Privacy information : http://abc.net.au/privacy.htm<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Good for the National Party . The Democrats want to postpone a vote until after the election because they fear that they'll lose their jobs if they come out in favor of gay marriage rght before an election . It appears that OZ has a lot in common with the US ; we both have a majority of voting citizens that oppose gay marriage . The only difference is that in the US , gays lack the guts to put the issue to a national vote . They prefer to target Liberal judges who will create fiat laws in their favor without an act of Congress . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I'm not sure that's it . Australia is pretty well evenly divided ... http://www9.sbs.com.au/theworldnews/...86834&region=7 The majority of those aged 18 - 34 , who are the future , support same-sex marriage , which makes Australia like many countries . If this is a popularity contest , it's just a matter of time , anyway .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I wouldn't be so sure . Kids have a way of becoming more conservative as they get older . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You only wish the clock could be turned back , don't bet on it .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I have three kids , 21 , 19 and 17 and interact with them and their peers daily . YOU would be surprised . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I have family and know people in that age group too . They are accepting of gay and lesbian people , and can't understand why anyone would see homosexuality as an issue .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Who are you to say it is unjust ? Who are 5 people to say a law is unjust ? We have a system that says the most votes for something wins . .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>We are the ones being oppressed by the majority that is who we are . It is our lives that are on the ballot and our rights that our being denied that is who we are . We are the ones who are being told we are second calss citizens . We are the ones who are being told are families are not families . We are the ones who are told we are less then dirt . Of course being a heterosexual you would not understand . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I suggest you get a majority of people and change the law then . This is what happened during slavery ... they actually passed 3 amendments about it . The courts aren't the all knowing group of people that have enlightened minds about what is or isn't fair . Your whole case is based on saying the majority is always be ignored if someone objects to them . I am in the minority when it comes to abortion ... does this mean the court should listen to me and declare abortion illegal ?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No because abortion does not effect your life personally . That iis waht we mean the courts should look at the INDIVIDUIALS life and decide upon that . If a law that the majority favors is unjust in an individuials life then it must be over ruled for the individuials sake . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>What ? That makes no sense . If a law is unjust to one person then it needs to be overruled ? Of course unjustice is defined by the person in question . You make no sense here . You still fail to understand how our courts work too . You want them to work a certain way as opposed to the way they were created under our constitution .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You want a society that oppresses people . If the law effects even one person adversly then it is unjust and needs to be overturned . IT only goes to prove that conservatives are heartless and want people to suffer . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I want a society that is free to make laws and rules as it sees fit . I guess we oppress child molesters but I am ok with that .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>They did leave in a very key statement in the provision essentially making it non-mandatory to some extent : " But it also says marriage officers need not perform a ceremony between same-sex couples if doing so would conflict with his or her " conscience , religion and belief . " ( http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/1...8LCTCSG0.html) At least they've recognized that making officials do that may be infringing on their religious freedom .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The link doesn't work . This is unfortunate if it applies to public officials . I believe public officials are there to serve all members of the public , equally under the law . That's their job . I'm glad they have to do their job in Canada . Would you want a public servant to refuse you because he or she does not share your Evangelical beliefs , jyoshu ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I certainly would NOT want someone forced to do something against their religious beliefs . If I went to a public official and it were against their religious belief to perform a heterosexual civil ceremony , I'd simply find someone that would , rather than try to force that person to do it . Here's the corrected link , by the way : http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/11/14/D8LCTCSG0.html<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If one can't do the job , one should look for another job . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Apparently not , in South Africa . I don't see why marriage freedom should automatically trump religious freedom , and apparently SA feels the same way .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Do you agree with me then , that this is an impediment to the public servant doing his or her job ? This is nonsense . I'm glad I live in Canada , where the religion of others is not imposed into my life .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Sorry , but people have certain natural rights -- keeping people from being religious infringes on that . I'm not saying businesses can't legally do it -- they can -- I'm saying I think it's pretty unethical . It's easy for you to sit back and say what you're saying when you dislike religion , but this is no different than an employer telling a gay employee they can't express themselves as being gay on the job . One is discrimination for being gay , the other is discrimination for being religious . If you're going to be for equality , then be for equality in all cases . Not just picking and choosing your pet issues .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Once again jyoshu ; I manage a fast food resturant . Do you agree that I do not have to serve boy scouts and evangelical christains ? My moral beliefs are against them I should have the right to turn away their business . After all they go against my religious beliefs so I can refuse to serve , or even hire them . Right ? If I use your logic I should beable to do whatever I want and use my religious beliefs as an excuse . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Mistaken notion ? She said clearly " I've worked on plenty of legislation . . . We enact the will of the people " It sounds to me like she's a legislator . That's certainly the way it comes across -- how could you possibly take that any other way ? A better analogy would be if you were trying to force a Jewish employee , whom you KNEW was Jewish , to work on his sabbath rather than being willing to work with him about that . Or to suddenly tell him he has to eat a pork sandwich or something . And remember , this is a different issue than benignly serving food . We're talking about a major religious issue here -- gay marriage , to religious people , is like asking them to approve most any bad thing in society you can think of . You have to take the seriousness of the religious view into account here somewhat .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Why ? It is not my problem they have evil religious values . Do they work for the state or God ? Does God pay their paychecks or do the taxpayers ? They just have to sign a civil contract . So what if that person is the only person able to do marriage contracts in the area . How does the state ensure that gay people can exersize their right to marriage if the only person able to perform the marriage is exempted from perfoming the marriage based upon religious beliefs ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I just think you are viewing this the wrong way -- making it more complicated than it is . It is simply a provision that allows a person to let someone else conduct the civil ceremony if their religious beliefs don't allow them to do it . The same idea that would allow a Jewish person to pass on eating pork if it were suddenly expected for him or her to do it when it wasn't before . That's all this is -- let's not make mountains out of molehills ...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yet what if there is no one else in the community ? How is the government going to ensure gay people are able to exersize their rights ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well , then I guess they need to ensure someone is there that WILL do it as well . Gee , that darn religious freedom -- messing everything up , huh ?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>New England and New York will probably have gay marriage within the next few years . The West Coast might also follow suit after that . I think the recent wave of gay marriage legalization will stop for the next 20 years or so after that . 30 states already define marriage as between a man and a woman .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Don't be so sure . If Congress removes DOMA and with Roberts and Alito on the court same sex marriage will come to the rest of the country with a 7 to 2 ruling . Roberts and Alito are constitutional literalists and with DOMA out of the way the full faith and credit clause is a clear constitutional mandate . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Can you demonstrate evidence that the SCOTUS would nullify gay marriage bans in all states ? If the SCOTUS was so imposed , why don't they just strike DOMA down right now and then declare all gay marriage bans unconstitutional ? Secondly , states can choose not to recognize gay marriage even without federal DOMA . There is a choice of law doctrine that allows states to not recognize other states marriages that they find " offensive " to their own public policy . States have been not recognizing each others marriages for decades and states do not use the FFC clause to make one state recognize another's marriage . There is no case history of FFC ever used in this way . Even in cases where it has been attempted , the legal argument involved is so lengthy , that it effectively prohibits FFC use due to the sheer amount of hassle and legal proceedings involved in winning such a case . :)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It is called the constitution of the United states http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#A4Sec1 A marriage license is a public act and record <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Which you're obviously ignorant of . You completely failed to respond to the choice of law doctrine , as well as my request that you provide justification on your claims of how each Justice would vote , as well as my challenge to you to explain why DOMA has not been declared unconstitutional if your claims about the Justices were true . Apparently , the law is beyond your comprehension , as is your ability to consider facts in forming your opinions .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>In answer to your question . Steven , Kennedy , Souter , Ginsburg , and Breyer will side with us . Roberts and Alito will follow the constitution as written . Scalia and Thomas are a lost anti gay cause . That is how I know how they will vote . As to why DOMA has not been declared unconstitutional is because there has not been a case in the courts challenging DOMA and so has not been taken up by SCOTUS . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I'll do a little research on your claims . Regardless , you still failed to address how state courts may use the choice of law doctrine so that the FFC clause does not apply , and if it were , the sheer complication of applying the law would make it effectively prohibitive . By all means , post up the FFC clause again so you can avoid addressing this . :)<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I do not see how choice of law doctrine is not trumped by the full faith and credit clause in cases of marriage contract since there is a current tradition of one state respecting other states marriage licenses when it comes to heteros . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>The choice of law doctrine is used to settle differences between different state laws . That is how the law is practiced , and that is what courts believe . Again , states have been disagreeing on the validity of each other's marriages for decades and there has been no case history of the full faith and credit clause that has made one state recognize another state's marriage . Courts look to the choice of law doctrine before the FF & C C.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Since the " traditional definition " of marriage is a human-made construct , humans can change it to meet changing times . Case in point , the " traditional definition " of marriage according to Blackwell's Commentaries on the Common Law meant the disappearance of the identity of the woman into the identity of the man .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The legal definition is a human-made construct and as such can change . But given it is a human-made construct and we live in a democracy , the way it would change is via a vote . In 26 states so far the definition of marriage remains one man and one woman . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not so . Fundamental rights are not subject to plebescites . See Loving v . Virginia for a fuller exegesis .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This seems so absolute for someone that believes in an " evolving " constitution . Perhaps we evolved out of the Loving decision which was incorrect in reasoning . Even if a right is in the constitution , it is still subject to a vote ... just takes a bigger one to amount of votes . Finally , what does marriage being a " fundamental right " have to do with anything if the question is defining marriage ? You said it was subject to change ... so how does it change if not by vote ? By your opinion ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>"    ... the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature , in order , among other things , to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority .    Alexander Hamilton Once again , if you have a problem with this , take it up with the Framers , not with me . Anyone defending the principle that same-gender marriage can be banned by state action must first show as a condition precedent that marriage is not a fundamental right or , in the alternative that there is a COMPELLING REASON to ban the practice . Even for this rogue Court , that's a high burden to meet .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I don't have a problem with it but it seems you do . What I do have a problem with is the courts deciding legislative items . You propose the judiciary become the legislative branch . On the contrary . You must show why it isn't a state power to do so . Also , you didn't answer any of my questions . For someone that believes in an evolving constitution why can't it evolve away from the Loving decision ?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The court upheld equal protections . You accuse the court of illegitimate " judicial activism " for upholding such protections . Obviosly so far as you are concerned , if equal protections are upheld for gay Americans , it's illegitimate . Obviously not in the states that prohibit it . Can't you read the laws ? Indeed , the state and federal laws on the issue are specifically directed against gay people . It is woefully disingenuous of you to pretend otherwise . Another case of malicious disingenuity . Not even you can take it seriously with a straight face that these laws don't exist because gay people insist on equal rights , and homophobes want to deny them . If you don't know what equality means , by all means invest in a dictionary . Then you haven't much understanding of it . It applies to this case , and there are a large number of court decisions that agree with this understanding , this being just the latest . The straw men are all in your posts .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why can't you answer my question ? I simply said that it is illegitimate to say the constitution means one thing when it never has . I certainly can and there is nothing saying they can't within the restrictions by the law . Perhaps you don't . Let's look at marriage as an example . Marriage restrictions based on age , sex , species , number of , capacity , and perhaps a few other things . If you want " equal protection " the way you define it then all of these restrictions ( short of capacity ) would have to be removed . Is this what you mean by equal protection ? There seems to be more that disagree with you but that is beside the point . The only way you get to equal protection meaning what you want it to mean is if you evolve the constitution to a new meaning . If you can prove to me how gay marriage was part of the original meaning of the term " equal protection " then I'd be very much impressed . nice response Can you show me where I made a strawman ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Oh dear . I suppose I am extremely stupid in thinking that when a constitution says equal protections under the law , it means equal protections under the law . Evidently , it means : " Except gays " .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Can you show a document that suggests the original meaning of " equal protection " means equality for gays but not for other groups ? If you like I can explain the original understanding of the 14th amendment and how it wouldn't apply to gays unless they were denied marriage as defined today for being gay . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Can you show us a document that shows equality applies to groups other than gays ? Where does the Constitution say , " Except gays " ? Do you seriously imagine gay people want to marry the opposite sex ? Do you seriously think it is not an obstacle to their pursuit of life , liberty and happiness to prevent them from marrying the partners they love ? After all , you folk take your right to marry the consenting adults you love for granted , but for some pig-headed reason , you think it's OK to deny gay Americans the same rights you have . And you think that's constitutional ? Steve , that's bigotry .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are borderline breaking the rules of the forum . That aside , did you want me to explain the meaning of equal protection or not ? If it makes you feel better I wouldn't think it was denial of equal protection if marriage was denied as two men or two women marrying each other . No , they can't marry each other . Not sure how that is protection but if it is then consider gays protected too . I'm not saying you should think the way I do but at least I am trying to answer your questions and respond to your points . All you seem to be doing is ignoring my posts and insulting me . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>yawn . But since that is the denial of equal rights , obviously you would be wrong to think that . Nope . A very disingenuous argument . Gay partnerships are NOT protected the same way as straight ones -- in many places , they are illegal . That would be obvious even to a blind man , but not to someone deliberately denying the facts . I am pointing out that your opinions are wrong . As to why you make the erroneous arguments you do , i can only surmise .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No because in that case everyone is still allowed to marry under what marriage means . so is a daughter and father relationship which was the topic at hand ... Why are they wrong ? Why can't you explain why denial of some things that aren't equal is ok and doesn't violate equal protection but with gay marriage it does ? It is this question that makes or breaks your entire argument .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It has nothing to do with marriage equality . It is redefining the very meaning of marriage to allow gays to ' marry ' .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And that is a bad thing ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not necessarily but I wish some gay posters on here would be honest and not just use the words ' equality ' and ' discrimination ' when they obviously do not apply .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Lets see I can't legally marry the person of my choice but a heterosexual can and that is not discrimination and that is some how being equal to a heterosexual ? If it is not discrimination then what is it oatmeal cookies ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You cant seem to get it into your head that marriage is an institution that was created to be a union between a man and a woman that leads to the couple creating children within a stable nuclear family . Gays have nothing to do with it . Marriage has nothing to do with two blokes giving each other a wedding ring and being able bolster their self esteem by kidding themselves they are as normal as straights .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>That is only your opinion , and apparently you have never been to Las Vegas . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The last sentence could be seen as only an opinion but the rest of the post is indisputable<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Come on , Matthew , that's a lame argument . People are born black , but they can control their zippers so they can avoid engaging in gay sex sin .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>you think gay people have a choice in being gay or not ? in that case , do i have a choice in being sexually attracted to females or males ? AAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA ! no ! <br><b>S1:2-  </b>If gays don't have any CHOICE in engaging in illicit gay sex sin then you'd darn well better be on your guard in shopping malls and street corners . ROTFLOL !<br><b> S2:2-  </b>im talking about sexual attraction , you burke . being gay or straight isnt a choice , it just happens . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Unzipping their pants for illicit gay sex , in violation of the Word of God , is a choice , snicklefritz .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>so gay people should just stay celebate for their entire lives because you dont like what they do . well done .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I really wish that you would read my posts before commenting . I have clearly stated that gay marriages should not be prohibited . I am stating .. and you have posted nothing to make me think otherwise ... that gay marriage is simply not the same as hetero marriage and to recognise this is not to discriminate against it . If gays are allowed to marry then any kind of marriage between consenting adults should be allowed .. otherwise you are discriminating against the person wanting to enter into the marriage , however distasteful it appears to you .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I have been with my partner for 15 years . I am having my own biological twin baby boys due this December . Do you not think that we are a family that deserves all the same protections of heterosexual couples ? So you consider my children less deserving of the same protections just because one of us does not have a vagina ? What is the difference in my family and other families ? We have two parents and will be the parents of two children with full custody . Please if you can describe to me what makes my family less deserving of full protections and what makes us different besides the fact that one of us does not have a vagina . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You seem to like pointing out that one of you doesnt have a vagina . I think I guessed that . I have news for you ... there is no penis in a lesbian Ask me the same question minus the BS and I will attempt to answer it<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I smell the BS and it's not coming from me . Here ya go . I have been with my partner for 15 years . I am having my own biological twin baby boys due this December . Do you not think that we are a family that deserves all the same protections of heterosexual couples ? So you consider my children less deserving of the same protections just because one of us is not a woman ? What makes my family any different and less deserving of equal protections including marriage than any other families ? We have two parents and will be the parents of two children with full custody . Please if you can describe to me what makes my family less deserving of the full protections given to that of heterosexual headed households and what makes us different besides the fact that one of us is not a woman ( is that better ) . What reason would you give to my children as to why they are less deserving than other children ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You deserve as much protection as an incestuous / polygamous or any other sexually deviant relationship that has outsourced their children . Hope this helps . Please tell me who forced you into outsourcing children ? If no one did then you are responsible for your children , not me .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>My children are in no way " outsourced " as they are my biological children . No one is asking for YOU to care for my children as I have all the same taxes and other responsiblities to my government as you do . Please try to answer my question as to why my family is less deserving of government benefits than a heterosexual headed household . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Depends on your circumstances . They may be more deserving of government benefits than some heterosexual households . Do you need to marry your partner to recieve these benefits ? Are you more deserving than a single parent that deliberately has a clutch of children then moans because of lack of government support ?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>With full civil marriage equality , a whole host of benefits are brought about to strengthen my family such as survivors benefits for social security as just one example . Another example would be my husband , given that marriage equality were a reality , would automatically gain guardianship of our children were anything to happen to me . These of course are only a couple of the more than a thousand benefits marriage brings about . Certainly , you may argue that contracts drawn by a paid attorney or myself could reap these same benefits , but I do not understand what legitimate reason my family must jump through these hoops when heterosexual headed households are not required , asked or even expected to do the same . Two parents , two children , participating and supporting equally with our governments requirements as any other family , however receiving no reciprocation from the government to strengthen and protect my famly as It does heterosexual headed families . And no , I am certainly not more deserving than anyone else . We do not nor have not ever asked for a handout of any kind anymore than saying that a heterosexual headed household is asking for a handout when the parents are married . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>As you pointed out , it is only heterosexual couples that get to marry and reap the benefits from it . In a modern secular society there is no reason not to extend marriage to other forms of relationships . However just extending marriage to gay couples is not enough , it must be extended to all permutations of sexual relationships and society must look at sexual relationships that are otherwise banned . I cannot see why marriage should be granted to you but an incestuous relationship be illegal . Making homosexual sex legal is a far cry to making gay relationships officially equal to hetero ones . You are no ' better ' than two half brothers having a sexual relationship or a mother and son ..o r indeed a polygamous gay relationship ... it all deviates from the present definition of marriage . If you get it , everyone should get it .<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Would you agree that each form of proposed marriage arrangements would need to be argued on their own merits separately ? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Yes bit it should be considered in one package . I dont see why gays should have their relationships officialised ( is that a word ? ) and pull up the ladder so other types of relationships cannot follow . Before gay marriage is allowed then all types of sexual relationships should be considered . Lets face it , it would be far harder for people to accept a complete revolution in what we consider to be an appropriate relationship to become an official family than to just allow gays to do it ... using the very arguments that gays have to justify them officially marrying we can justify most other type of marriage . So to prohibit other forms of marriage would be tantamount to discrimination<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Certainly not yours . You should know that I am for no marriage in government . It should be left to a religious institution where it will actually mean something . The states should then go back to doing something that actually makes sense and doesn't reward people like Britney Spears for being white trash .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That is all well and good , but it is not the religious ceremony and sanction that gays are looking for . They already have that ; there are churches that perform same-sex marriages . It is the civil benefits that are at issue . Are you saying you would be in favor of foregoing ALL the legal rights and benefits you are afforded by marriage ? For example : * Assumption of Spouse    s Pension * Automatic Inheritance * Automatic Housing Lease Transfer * Bereavement Leave * Burial Determination * Child Custody * Crime Victim    s Recovery Benefits * Divorce Protections * Domestic Violence Protection * Exemption from Property Tax on Partner    s Death * Immunity from Testifying Against Spouse * Insurance Breaks * Joint Adoption and Foster Care * Joint Bankruptcy * Joint Parenting ( Insurance Coverage , School Records ) * Medical Decisions on Behalf of Partner * Certain Property Rights * Reduced Rate Memberships * Sick Leave to Care for Partner * Visitation of Partner    s Children * Visitation of Partner in Hospital or Prison * Wrongful Death ( Loss of Consort ) Benefits What do you say ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>yeah I know . I'm saying that there should be a better system . For example , if you had a best friend who you are roommates with ... both hetero for the sake of argument ... and never wish to get married then could they get some of the benefits you described ? My Uncle actually was single until he died but he had a female friend who he was best friends with ... why couldn't they get some kind of benefits if they so choose ? Hospital vistiation rights and things of that nature are obviously the most important in this kinda situation . It just seems the single folks are the ones getting screwed over in the marriage deal :)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But gay folks are not ? To the single folks , I say get married . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Ok , lets use that logic .... To the gay folks I say marry a woman . Bet you aren't happy with that :)<br><b> S2:3-  </b>If you want the benefits of marriage , get married . But you ought to be able to marry a person of your choice . Your suggestion would be to marry someone I don't want to me married to , that is a different thing . It is not using " that logic " . I thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you . Isn't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities ? I am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly . I happen to think that's a bad idea . People get married for many reasons , some of which I would feel are not good reasons , but I would not make it illegal to do so . I am talking about the right to marry a person of your choosing .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It's not bigotry that motivates me to oppose gay marriage . It's the fact that it will hurt more people than it helps and that the benefits deserved by gays can be had without redefining . It's just that simple . No bigotry ... just facts .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Just who in the hell is it hurting ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not me ... I'm divorced ! ;) It hurts the people who view marriage as a sacred bond between a man and a woman ... and there is a BUNCH of them ... a BIG bunch ! I'd say that bunch of people is about a hundred times greater than the little bunch that wants to destroy that idea . If it were such that the rights and benefits granted to married couples could not be granted to gays without allowing them to ' marry ' , then I'd say the big bunch needs to suck it up and relent . However , that is not the case .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Tough . Real measurable damages , please . Offending a bunch of folk's sensibilities isn't damage . Appeasing faith justified hate however , IS in a secular society . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>There's no hate here . Then let's not be worried with the sensibilities of either bunch . If hurting your sensibilities should not count , then the legitimization of gay life should be henceforth unimportant to you . The only consideration should be the rights . I say you are entitled to all the rights and I say that it is unnecessary to redefine marriage in order to get them . You will say that it ( redefinition ) is the easiest way to assure the rights ... I say it is unecessary . None of this constitutes bigotry . Find a real fault with the argument that redefinition is unnecessary . Show some actual , measurable damages caused by not redefining .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Bull . I'm not buying . One of my all time favorite quotes ; " I can see a church by daylight " or if you prefer ; " If it looks like a duck and qucaks like a duck ... " <br><b>S1:4-  </b>... and I'm not selling . If you want to claim I am a hate-filled bigot , please quote a passage where I expressed it . If you can't do that , find something else to throw my way . I have argued with cold logic , favoring nobody . There is no need to redefine marriage . Dissatisfaction in not being eligible for marriage does not constitute a need .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>The evidence shows that people aren't interested in giving gays these benefits under another name . The simply aren't interested in granting them benefits at all . Seperate rules - will allow for different rules - and make it damned easy to ensure gays don't actually get everything heteros have . I don't think you are a hate filled bigot - but I think most of those you seek to appease with your reasoning are . And JP stepped on my last nerve recently .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I find it curious that every time someone makes the correct assertion that AIDS became an epidemic in the US through the gay community , gays and their PC apologists immediately try to deflect the argument and want to talk about Africa . I don't give a flying F @#$ about how it spread in Africa ; I'm talking about the USA . Show me that my assertion is inaccurate and I will apologize , but don't join the rest of the apologists in trying to change the debate . The topic is AIDS in the US , not Africa , not Asia , not the South Pole .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The reason we bring up Africa is to knock down the reason you bring up the stats in the US . You didn't just come along and start a chat about the progression of AIDS in the US . You threw it out as justification for those who oppose gay rights . If you want to use it like a weapon against gays - then expect tit for tat , JP . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The topic is gay marriage IN THE USA . What part of that topic includes Africa ? Please try to keep up . Statements like the above make you look flighty .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Its your LOGIC we are refuting - location is IRRELEVANT . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Location sure as hell is relevant . If I tell you that a bus hit a bunch of people in New York , why would you retort with 2 buses hit a group of people in Africa ? It is an obvious attempt to deflect the focus away from the first statement , is it not ? It's not my logic that you're trying to refute , you're trying to deflect the topic away from how AIDS spread in the US . If you want to refute my statement , show me some FACTS , not wishes , opinions , feelings , or other means of subterfuge . I'll say it again for you . AIDS reached critical mass and became an epidemic in the US primarily via the gay community . If you don't agree , show proof to support the contrary . It shouldn't be that difficult . If I'm nothing but a gay-bashing bigot who makes wild claims , then surely you can refute my claim with facts pertaining to the topic in bold , can't you ? But , if I'm actually NOT a gay-bashing bigot and have the facts to back up my claim , then you'd better continue with the subterfuge , deflection and dismissals because all you will have is fraudulent PC rhetoric .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I wouldn't unless you were using it as justification to ban buses in New York . Exactly the point I am trying to make to , JP . Thank you .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Indeed protesting made a difference , but it didn't happen until enough people came on board . All the protesting in the world wouldn't have brought it about if the will of the people were not changing to make it happen . At the end of the day , any legislative movement needs the will of the people to be successful . It may not need a full majority in some cases , but it needs enough people on board . That's why legislation requires not only voting ( by legislature ) , but elected officials to do so as well . There was a process our country went through on those issues as whether or not they were legitimate in terms of the law -- it involved a national debate , protests , etc. Sometimes this process results in our country ( the people ) granting civil rights legislation , and sometimes it doesn't ( depending on whether it is deemed warranted ) . The process ( which will undoubtedly take years ) is going on right now in regards to gays . Time will tell what the result will be . Any form of legislation is a voting matter . That's the way our system works .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why is it that whenever this comes up you insist on conflating " the people voting on a law " with " the legislature voting on a law " or " the people electing politicians " ? Why can't you simply discuss the topic at hand ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>In what way do you feel it is not the issue at hand ? Matthew asked about voting on his civil rights and this is all part of the voting process .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>In exactly the way I just said . He asked about people voting on laws , not legislators voting on laws . Again , why can't you answer that question ; why do you feel that it's necessary to move the topic around ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Fair enough ; but regardless , the point still stands -- people voting on laws is indeed allowed under our system . ( Ballot initiatives . ) It is all part of the process I mentioned to Matthew of society determining its standards . If you have a beef with the people being able to work toward determining our society's standards ( through voting on such issues ) , then if I were you I'd take it up with the govt .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Or we could take it up here , like Matthew did , and discuss it . Or at least try to , and hope someone doesn't derail the conversation into irrelevant issues like how the legislature works . I will echo the point that several have made here . The idea of allowing the masses to determine civil rights is stupid and wrong . If a group's civil rights need protecting , then they need protecting from the very masses that are doing the voting . Ballot measures may be a legal process , but that doesn't prevent them from being stupid and wrong , now does it ? That's the point that's trying to be made here . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well , that's up to you . If you don't want to derail it , you don't have to . It seems to me that what is really happening in society with these ballot initiatives and other parts of the process is determining whether or not it is a civil right in the first place to give legal marriage to whatever group arrangement is in question . ( In this case , gays couples . ) That process has to take place ; it is just not feasible in our society to give marriage equality to any group of any arrangement that comes along demanding it until we determine for certain that it needs to be done . If society determines that same-sex arrangements of two people should suffice to redefine marriage for it to be included , then so be it . But that process has to be there in some form , realistically . If you are going to draw the line in terms of what can be voted on a ballot initiative or not , what authority determines that ? How are you going to determine where that line is drawn ? And you can't just arbitrarily say " when civil rights are being infringed " because that doesn't carry any legal weight -- it's opinion . Just saying it's " stupid " and " wrong " may be your point being made , but it's a point that doesn't offer any solutions .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You really are a piece of work . All you're saying here is that if society wants to be bigoted it should be allowed to be . Very libertarian of you , but I believe that if the power of the government can be used to fight evil and prejudice , it should . If wrong is happening , and the government can stop it , it should . You will of course claim that the government can't do anything , but history has proven that position wrong . The government has taken stands against biggotry before , and while it hasn't eradicated it , it has improved things . Gee , now I'm supposed to offer solutions before you even get what the point is ? I'm I allowed to use both hands while I type ? Any other restrictions you want to add ?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>http://www.infopt.demon.co.uk/marriage.htm This site shows a large range of historical instances of gay marriage . Romans did it , so did celts , greeks http://www.generationq.net/articles/...3401cacd56d303 This one focuses on marriage in american-indian tribes , and how the homosexuals were actually greatly valued as healers and prophets . Just take a look at the Old Testament to find marriages between one man and many women . Polygamy is also present in African and Islamic culture too . And in some tribes in Nigeria , there is a culture of polyandry ( one woman , many men ) . So marriage is not some one man , one woman thing that has been adhered to since time began . As an ' ideal ' , it's far more recent that you might think . Smiley<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Marriage has always been about different genders . I made no mention of solely one to one . If you look closely at history you will find that marriage ( a couple of Bhuddist sects apart ) has always been between opposite genders . There have been cultures where homosexual relationships have existed for short periods and often for specific cultural purposes but marriage per se has been between opposite genders . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Evidently you didn't read the links I gave you . To put it another way , there are many many examples of gay marriage throughout history . This idea that it is new and abnormal is ridiculous . Smiley<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I clearly did , I suspect you may have but didn't understand . None of those unions were accepted to be marriage but unions for a particular purpose . Marriage took place later between man and woman . Your concept is new . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>That's interesting !! You made the point about marriage having been an opposite sex institution before . I gave many examples of societies where same sex marriage was commonplace . You then said that they weren't really marriage because marriage was something new . Now you're saying that same sex marriage has been against society's beliefs since the year dot . So is marriage a new thing that is only a male-female thing , or is marriage something that has been around since the year dot ( and would include those examples that I gave - American Indian berdaches , gay marriage within early Roman society etc ) ? I assume early Roman society falls within the year-dot-till-now period . Smiley<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Same sex marriage has never been commonplace . There are a couple of Bhuddist sects who allow it . It was definitely frowned on in Roman Times . The Greeks had homosexual liaisons , some from desire , some for a form of mentoring reasons . They were never marriages and never assumed to be so by those Societies . Those Greek Roman Chinese and any other Society accepted certain homosexual liaisons but marriage was something else . It was between people of opposite genders and that is not new it was how it was originally<br><b>S1:1-  </b>[ QUOTE = gaetano ; 255273 ] As you say , marriage is a public institution and like all institutions has its rules and requirements . If you want to change those rules and requirements then by all means lobby to do so . You are entitled to do so . Equally people who do not wish to change the rules and regulations are entitled to lobby to keep the status quo . You only BELIEVE gays have the right to marriage . Other people BELIEVE they do not . Ask for a vote on it and abide by the majority decision .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Isn't cruel and unjust to decide that someone else should not have what you enjoy ? How would you feel if the world was the other way around . How would you feel if the world were gay and you as a heterosexual were being told you couldn't marry the person you loved because it was against someone elses , that you didn't know or have never met , religious beliefs or that they have some sort of ikk factor ? Can you not put youself in the place of gay people and ask yourself how would I feel ? Do you have any empathy ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>In answer to your first question as it stands , No , it happens all the time . If society had set up the institution of marriage as a gay one since OG was in his cave then I would certainly try and lobby otherwise if I disagreed . If the lobbying failed and the rest of Society said we keep things the way we want them however sorry they may feel , then I would clearly have to abide by that , although lobbying would continue . However castigating people because of their beliefs or stating they shouldn't have them , must be wrong . Otherwise I could claim that you are not entitled to your beliefs which clearly you are<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That is not what I asked you . Do you really lack any empathy ? I didn't ask you what you would do I asked you how you would feel . Let's try again How would you feel if the world was the other way around ? How would you feel if the world were gay and you as a heterosexual were being told you couldn't marry the person you loved because it was against someone elses , that you didn't know or have never met , religious beliefs or that they have some sort of ikk factor ? Can you not put youself in the place of gay people and ask yourself how would I feel ? Do you have any empathy ? For the record I do not believe I have the right to tell anyone who they should be allowed to marry but many of those that are anti same sex marriage think that they have a right to tell people who they should be allowed to marry . Just because something happens all the time does not mean it is not cruel and unjust . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>First of all it is not against " someone else's beliefs " in that incredibly simplistic way . It is against the beliefs of society since the year dot , religious beliefs or ' ikk ' factor whatever that is are irrelevant even if they contribute to some people's attitudes . Second yes I would probably feel sad if I wasn't allowed to marry the person I was with BUT I would be with the person I love in any event . Thirdly , as marriage is looked on as a public institution then Society as a whole is entitled to lay down the rules relating to it just as Society lays down the rules and laws by which we live . Cruelty and injustice occur when you are stopped from doing something you are entitled to do . Gay marriage at present is not something you are entitled to it would seem . Have to say in the UK we have made some steps towards that .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I really think you can not put yourself in someone elses place . So you believe that " Cruelty and injustice occur when you are stopped from doing something you are entitled to do . " ? Is this correct ? So if I use your belief on another topic , say slavery , you then would conclude that slavery was neither cruel nore injust 1 since it was a legal and traditional activity practiced since OG was in the cave 2 slaves should not think it was cruel and unjust because they had no legal rights and standing and thus was not cruel and unjust since they were slaves . My point is just because something is the law or not the law does not make it any less cruel or unjust when viewed from a certain perspective . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Firstly I am not even going to put slavery on the same level as gay marriage . I frankly do not believe that the alleged suffering gays not being allowed to marry comes in any way close to the suffering of slaves . Secondly you are of course perfectly correct about cruelty and injustice ( neither or certainly the first one do I think apply to gay marriage ) and the way forward was to lobby etc as Wilberforce did to abolish slave trade . We can only advance in civilisation ( I hope ) but lobbying publicity etc can help people's awareness in bring matters before their eyes to decide on . There will always be minorities of dissenters ( strange world if none ) but in the last analysis Society determines how it is run . You talk about the tyranny of the majority but of course the reverse can also be true .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I am not comparing the two . I am using your own beliefs and statements and appling them to slavery .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Maybe that's because my family represents the norm , not a deviation from the norm .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yeah , diversity sure sucks , doesn't it ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yep , perversity sure does . ;)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>What is perverse in your view ? That which isn't the norm , that which is diverse ? It's a very long list , so I doubt you believe this . You hate a particular form of diversity : gays . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You assume too much . As I've pointed out before , I don't hate gays , I just don't believe that we should redefine marriage for them . Period .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You call me or a family I may have , a perversion ( sorry the word was " perversity " ) , but that is not hate ? I believe I am probably younger than you , but that doesn't mean I was born yesterday . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You can believe what you want , no matter how wrong you are .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Don't put words in my mouth . I said the gay community was responsible for AIDs reaching critical mass and becoming an epidemic . If you disagree , prove me wrong . :) Long time ? Do I know you ?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>* shrugs* The Heterosexual commonity was responsible for AIDS reaching critical mass and becoming an epidemic worldwide . If you disagree , prove me wrong . :) Guess we should all become lesbians , as they haven't contributed to the " critical mass " . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I'll tell you what . If you believe that heterosexuals are the reason for AIDS becoming an epidemic , then I challenge you to a formal debate . Here's a proposed resolution : Resolved : The AIDS epidemic in the US reached critical mass primarily as a result of homosexual activities . Does that work for you ?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>* Shrugs* I have no desire to get in a formal debate with someone who seems bigoted and ignorant of reality . You might look into the word " sarcasm " to explain my post . It was to point out that worldwide heterosexuals are the largest AIDS carrying group , and to point out the fallacies of your arguments . The whole point is that you can't " lay the blame " on any group based on their sexual orientation . The only group that can be blamed for the spread of age is either the group that does drugs ( heteros , bisexuals , and homosexuals alike ) , or the group that does not practice safe sex ( again , heteros , bisexuals , and homosexuals alike ) . Your arguments sound frighteningly similar to those that blame african-americans for different things , or for those in Nazi Germany which blamed numerous thing on Jews ( and , ironically , homosexuals ) . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If my argument is full of fallacies , then you should be able to tear me up in a formal debate on the topic , right ? Go ahead , take your best shot or is it just easier for you to call me a bigot a priori and attempt to dismiss the truth ? You can give the politically-correct party line all you like , I prefer to deal in reality with real facts . Show me that the progression of AIDS in the US spread from heteros to heteros initially and I'll apologize for my statements . But you can't because that would be a lie . Trying to bring red herrings into the topic to muddy the waters ? Nice try . Take me up on my offer to debate , please .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I don't have the time , nor the desire , nor the patience to debate someone who claims that gays are " to blame " for the spread of AIDS , when logic shows that at least worldwide , according to your points , Heteros should be to blame . Well , if you prefer to deal in reality with real facts , how about the fact that heterosexuals are the largest spreaders of AIDS worldwide ? Or does your reality not include Africa and Asia ? Wht I said has nothing to do with political-correctness . It is fact . Safe sex practices greatly reduce any risk of spreading HIV or AIDS . The reason it DID spread is due to both drug use and unsafe sex practices , neither of which are exclusive to one sexuality . It isn't a red herring to note an observation . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Again , you try to manipulate my words to mean something other than what I actually stated . I'm beginning to think that you are being disengenuous purposefully . Go back and read my actual statements and tell me how that relate to what you claimed . What part of Africa and Asia are in the US ? It reached critical mass in the US through the gay community . Period . Your attempts at subterfuge not-withstanding . And your statement sounds frighteningly similar to the SS Officiers at Nuremberg claiming no participation in the holocaust . ( That was just an observation , too . )<br><b> S2:4-  </b>If you aren't claiming that gays are responsible for spreading AIDS across the US , what , pray tell , ARE you trying to say ? At least two other posters here have concluded this is what you are arguing . And if you are claiming this , well , we should shun all them heteros who are responsible for spreading AIDS worldwide . What part of the US is not in the world ? No , it reached critical mass in the US through drug users and those who did not practice safe sex ( heteros , gays , and bisexuals alike ) . Unfortunately for you , my observations have some grounding in things you actually have said . Yours do not . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Again with the attempt to change the topic . I'm glad that you chickened out of a formal debate on the issue . You appear unable to stay on topic . What part of voting on gay marriage in the US includes Africa or any oother freaking country ? If you believe that , defend it with facts , not meritless statements pulled from the ether . You've provided no facts to dispute my assertion . You chickened out of a formal debate , continue to try to paint me as a bigot and dismiss my claims without any evidence . Put up or shut up . If I'm wrong , PROVE IT !!<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Well now , did you or did you not JUST get done saying : Why are you now saying that WE have the burden of proof on US . Hypocritical much ?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It's good to see all of the apologists coming out of the woodwork to argue against someone else's strawman argument . I've yet to see one person argue that AIDS wasn't initially spread in the US primarily by gays . Let's focus on what I really said , not what you would have liked me to have said .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yes you are right gay people were the first victims of the plague and yes gay people were the first to spread it within the US Is that the pat on the back you want ? It was also spread initially by blood transfusions . Do you then agree with Paul Cameron ? " At the 1985 Conservative Political Action Conference , Cameron announced to the attendees , ' Unless we get medically lucky , in three or four years , one of the options discussed will be the extermination of homosexuals . ' According to an interview with former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop , Cameron was recommending the extermination option as early as 1983 . " - Mark E. Pietrzyk , News-Telegraph , March 10 , 1995 . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No , what I want is an apology for being called a bigot for stating a fact !!!! Of course not , but that doesn't change the fact that I am angry that its here and consumes many good people and lots of resources that could be better spent curing cancer and other diseases , all because of the promiscuity of a small minority of the population .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So the lives of gay people are less important ? The statement you made is a bigoted statement . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Still throwing out strawmen , Matthew ? Show me where I EVER claimed that the lives of gays were less important .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Right here You have implied that those that the lives of those who catch and spread hiv , largely gay men in the US , are not as important and worth curing as those with cancer and other diseases . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>That's an inaccurate interpretation of what I wrote . I said that , had we not had all of this HIV in the US , our medical resources could have been doing something else , like finding a cure for cancer . That's a far cry from saying that now that we have AIDS , we should forget those infected and research something else .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It seems to me that the point there is that it is not a bigot ... er , spade merely because you CALL it a spade . IMO , if someone has to resort to name-calling , it tends to only indicate they are having to resort to something besides sound arguments .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Oh my . Perhaps we should say it's an anti-gay bias , or a person with an anit-gay bias ? Are the terms acceptance-challenged , inclusion-challenged , anti-discrimination challenged , appealing to you ? E Mutz or his " Joe " , assumed those protesting against gay discrimination are nuts or trying to hijack heritage , but won't say why . If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , chances are ... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Or maybe he's simply arguing a different point than you . IMO it's just simply arrogant of you to automatically write off disagreement as " bigotry " . YOUR view is that this is about " acceptance " ; but that doesn't mean that's the real issue . E Mutz is right in saying that disagreement is not the same as bigotry .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>What is the basis for the disagreement or the different point of view if it is not a lack of acceptance of homosexuality or its visible and open displays and representations ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>But the problem is that you insist on always mischaracterizing that as bigotry . It's a very ugly word , and I suspect that's the reason you use it ( for its effect ) and why you don't entertain the idea that bigotry may not always be what's behind it .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I say it is , and I explain why . Replace the word " gay " with another minority , and tell me it is not . It's an ugly thing . I've explained why I believe that's what's behind it . If you believe don't believe that , why don't you tell me what is behind it ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I think it all goes back to one's motivations . What I don't think you and some others understand is that people often don't take that stand on the basis of not liking gay people . They do it because of the way they view marriage . If any other minority came along wanting marriage to be changed from one man and one woman , I suspect they'd get the same response .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>We weren't just discussing marriage specifically . Somehow whenever gays are involved , a group of people take a stand of being opposed , because of the way they view one thing or another in society , as being straight-only , or excluding gays . Yes , from the anti-gay crowd , sorry those who don't wish to include gays . However , no other identified minority would want that , because only one minority identifies as gay . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>But it's not always about not-including-gays . That's not the basis in many cases . ( hey , that rhymes ! ) It's about the way they view marriage ! They'd be that way toward any group wanting to change marriage to fit themselves if it changed marriage from the traditional view . I assure you if there was a movement afoot in this country by polygamists to change marriage to include them , there would be a similar reaction toward that . It's not that you're gay . It's that you want to redefine marriage . Ah , there's no use . I've tried to get you to see this before .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The cultural meaning of marriage is a formalization of a mating pair , who , in turn , create and support a family unit . Love and reproduction are implied . The legal meaning of marriage is , in most States , a contract between two people who are not under the age of consent , of different genders , of the same species , not closely related and who are not already married . Homosexuals are not a part of the traditional or cultural meaning of marriage . In order to be included , the meaning of marriage would have to change . The catch-22 is that homosexual couples want to be included in the current meaning of marriage , but what gives marriage meaning specifically excludes homosexual couples .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That's your definition . It is certainly not my definition . You don't speak for all of society . I personally define marriage as a union of two people who love one another and wish to make a commitment to one another . If marriage is about reproduction , why does nobody bat an eye when a 65 year old woman marries a 68 year old man ? If you believe marriage is " formalization of a mating pair " , and " reproduction is implied " , doesn't this cheapen the institution of marriage in your eyes ? Obviously , they are not getting married to start a family ... perhaps love is what is important ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Mating pairs exist with or without marriage , and have no legal connection with marriage ( since , legally , it doesn't matter if the two people even like one another , or ever intend on consumating said marriage ) . The only connection between a mating couple and marriage is the connection made on a cultural level . So , logically , the cultural meaning of marriage would be the purpose of a mating couple . While ' purpose ' can mean different things , in this context I daresay most would refer to the evolutionary purpose of a mating couple : reproduction . Love is implied because love brings the couple together for that purpose . While legally a 27 yr old marrying a 70 yr old sugar daddy is not a problem , culturally speaking this marriage is not as meaningful as one that is in-line with the evolutionary purpose I outlined above . You can point to exceptions all you want , but all it does is outline the difference between the legal meaning and the cultural meaning of marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Who gave you the power to decide what is culturally meaningful ? And more importantly , should we legally define marriage based on your perception of " cultural meaning " ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No , you should legally define it any damn way you can get away with . The cultural definition comes from observation .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But who get's to decide that legal definition ... that's the point . In this specific case in point , the anti crowd wishes to limit the rights of others simply based on personally held beliefs ... when no harm is presented to any party involved . In a case such as this , I feel strongly that without a specific vector of harm , we must as a civilized society rule in favor of providing equal rights rather than limit rights of a minority . I think these 4 pages thus far make clear that cultural definition is based on subjective obeservation and personal opinion formed via that observation . Clearly , I and many others here do not share your cultural definition . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>In America the people generally vote on issues , or elect representatives to enact laws . That's how you change the legal definitions . This isn't about equality , snakespit . The title of this thread shows that :P In all seriousness , though , it really isn't about equality . I don't think you have a rational basis upon which to dispute that observation . It is an indisputible fact that the cultural view that has dominated this country ( as evidenced by the definition of marriage ) generally follows evolutionarily sound logic : monogamous pair bonding outside of close familial ties . Inclusion of homosexuals would obviously change that .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The cultural meaning of marriage is a formalization of a mating pair , who , in turn , create and support a family unit . Love and reproduction are implied . The legal meaning of marriage is , in most States , a contract between two people who are not under the age of consent , of different genders , of the same species , not closely related and who are not already married . Homosexuals are not a part of the traditional or cultural meaning of marriage . In order to be included , the meaning of marriage would have to change . The catch-22 is that homosexual couples want to be included in the current meaning of marriage , but what gives marriage meaning specifically excludes homosexual couples .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Nonsense Two 70 year old heteros on their 3 or 4th marriages are hardly going to have children . So as long as people beyond breeding age are allowed to contract marriage there is nothing wrong with gay people enetring marriage . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Only if you reduce the meaning of marriage to a contract between two people . In that case you've stripped any and all cultural meaning from the practice and homosexual marriage would be no more meaningful than two friends becoming married for the benefits . I would not view that as a happy occurance .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It means nothing now if people get divorced and remarried over and over and over again . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Perhaps it doesn't . Perhaps marriage has already lost all meaning . But no matter what happens , Matthew S , homosexual marriage cannot and will not have the same meaning . Either marriage has already lost meaning , or you have to destroy that meaning to be included .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I have news for you !!! With a 50% + divorce rate among heteros and 30 min annulment mills in Las Vegas , I think that ship has sailed . In a few years it seems like us gay people will be the only ones who actually want to get and stay married . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Apparently not , since trying to get homosexual marriage passed in State legislatures is and has been an uphill battle . People still place value in the meaning of ancient customs , even if their realization is imperfect .<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Yes it does , because what is happening here is that ' family ' and ' marriage ' are being redefined . It is being broadened . People like Colson believe that marriage and family fits a certain criteria for it to truly be a marriage . That criteria IS traditional marriage , and if that changes that in Colson's eyes traditional marriage IS affected . I don't see how you can say that adopting gay marriage has no effect on that . I've heard Colson speak , BTW ; he speaks all over the country . I agree with some of what he's said and some I don't . He would say the same thing about kids raised in single parent homes ; but it's not that he's saying single parent homes are bad ; he's saying that homes with a mother and father are the best scenario . I think that's what he's saying here too . He's basically saying that by his observations of prisons , that traditional families do best in terms of raising children and them staying out of prison . Whether he's right or not is another matter , but I think it's important to at least represent the man's statements correctly here .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>He's done pretty well for a felon . Yet no constitutional amendment banning single-parenthood . How odd ... I wonder how long it will be before folks like Colson and you stop drawing conclusions about same-sex couples from your observations of single-parenthood . Never , I suppose . sigh <br><b>S1:2-  </b>How do you know he wouldn't support one if it were up for a vote ? I wonder how long it will be before folks like you stop claiming things that aren't happening ? I don't draw such conclusions . Sorry . . . accidentally misworded that . No " game " intended at all . I had no idea you've never had a typing mistake in your life .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That was a particularly bad volley . ( see below ) No , you just find them " compelling " . The game I'm talking about has nothing to do with that omission . The game , as you well know , is to engage in disagreement on every possible point . It's right there in your job description . Page 3 , paragraph 2 and 5 . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Look , there's really no need to be hostile here . With all due respect , I do agree on the record here sometimes with people who support gay rights . For instance , I've said I agree the amendment is a bad thing . I've said on numerous occassions that I agree that gays experience violence and harassment and measures must be taken to change that . I've agreed with the gay rights stance on gay adoption . I've agreed that gays shouldn't have to face job and housing discrimination . I've agreed on numerous things . Those aren't instances of disagreement , but of agreement . Maybe I just haven't often found your comments agreeable .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes , I know . You may remember that I pointed out your opposition to the amendment to another poster just the other day . It's precisely the discrepancy between your stated beliefs and your constant arguments in opposition to them that lead people to believe that you do not , in fact , support gay rights . There are other possibilities , of course . Personally , I've latched onto the idea that you're paid to be here . I realize it's a bit silly , but , frankly , it's the least morally repugnant one I can come up with , and I hate to think ill of people I don't know . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>What evv . I've latched onto the idea that you're main reason for being here is to post beligerantly about and to posters you disagree with about THEM rather than the topics at hand .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Sometimes it's hard to tell if people are going ghetto or going gay . Can you describe the hand gestures that went with that ?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Actually , I think it's probably the most compelling argument I've read for the amendment . The be fair , I don't think the author is claiming there is a direct link between gay marriage and crime . He seems to be talking about overall effect on society and traditional family . But I'm still against the amendment ; amending the constitution over something like this is just not the right thing to do .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>" compelling argument " ? So do you believe the basis of what he's claiming ? And are you ready to debate it ? Because there is no " overall effect on society and traditional family " from gay marriage . The " traditional family " has been having its OWN problems , and has been in decline in these countries LONG BEFORE gay marriage ever was legalized . It's like a guy jumping out of an airplane , and he starts falling to the ground . Three seconds later gay marriage is legalized , and conservatives want to blame the fact that he's falling on gay marriage ... It makes no sense . There is no causality here ... Do straight people say , " Hey ! Gay marriage is legal . I don't want to get married now . " Do straight people say , " Hey ! Gay marriage is legal . I want to get a divorce now . " The " most compelling argument " lacks any semblance of sense . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes it does , because what is happening here is that ' family ' and ' marriage ' are being redefined . It is being broadened . People like Colson believe that marriage and family fits a certain criteria for it to truly be a marriage . That criteria IS traditional marriage , and if that changes that in Colson's eyes traditional marriage IS affected . I don't see how you can say that adopting gay marriage has no effect on that . I've heard Colson speak , BTW ; he speaks all over the country . I agree with some of what he's said and some I don't . He would say the same thing about kids raised in single parent homes ; but it's not that he's saying single parent homes are bad ; he's saying that homes with a mother and father are the best scenario . I think that's what he's saying here too . He's basically saying that by his observations of prisons , that traditional families do best in terms of raising children and them staying out of prison . Whether he's right or not is another matter , but I think it's important to at least represent the man's statements correctly here .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>LOL ! I don't see how you can say that it DOES have an effect on that . Tell me , for starters , WHAT effect it will happen . Will Colson get a divorce if gay marriage is legalized ? Will Colson wish he had never gotten married if gay marriage is legalized ? THEY are claiming SPECIFIC effects . NEGATIVE effects . Effects that should be PROVEN for them to be claimed ... HOW can they claim those SPECIFIC DETRIMENTAL effects from gay marriage onto OTHER PEOPLE's marriages ??? Where's the proof ? 1 ) Studies DO back-up the issue of " single vs dual parent house-holds " . And that is common sense . Two heads are better than one . Twice the capability to care . 2 ) Studies REFUTE the claims that dual heterosexual parents are better than dual gay parents . They aren't . Gay parents are just as good . The gender of the parents are irrelevant . The sexual orientation of the parents is irrelevant . Where did I misrepresent something Jyoshu ? He's claiming a SPECIFIC DETRIMENTAL EFFECT on families due to gay marriage . THAT is what I'm talking about . THAT is what I want proven , if he's going to claim it . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Easy . . . marriage in the defined sense will be changed . It will be more broadened . Where did he claim that ? All I see is that he feels that traditional families are better in terms of kids from them staying out of prison . It seemed to me you were representing this as someone ' blaming ' gay marriage for crime . If that's not what you meant , then fair enough .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Is that ALL the effect you are claiming then ? Are you then contradicting the previous article's claim that it will have a negative effect on heterosexual marriages ? Did you read the article Jyoshu ? Do you even know what we're talking about ? Again , did you READ the article Jyoshu ? Because if not , then why did you claim : " Actually , I think it's probably the most compelling argument I've read for the amendment . " For Jyoshu's edification : If you don't comprehend that is PRECISELY what the author IS doing , then I don't know what to tell you . It's there in black and white ! <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I never said I was compelled , or convinced by the article . I said it was probably the most compelling that I've seen . I see nothing in that quote blaming gay marriage for crime , directy OR even indirectly . You are making an inference --o ne that may or may NOT be intended . I would think if Colson's point was to lay blame for crime he would have simply said so . He didn't . Colson is simply opposing thge amendment because he believes that traditional families are best in terms of avoiding crime . I don't really agree either -- I think there are too many variables for that to automatically be the case .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Oh . I see . So if somebody said " Christianity causes cancer " , that would be a compelling argument for people to not be Christians . Right ? Give me a freakin ' break Jyoshu . READ the article . It's talking about gay marriage and the effects of it on society . It makes claims that : 1 ) Gay marriage will cause detriment to straight marriages . 2 ) Detriment to straight marriages , e.g. single parent families , yield greater instances of criminals . It's all right there . In plain English . I am making no " inference " . This IS what the author is saying . Then explain to me his next paragraph where he links LEGALIZATION of gay marriage to a decrease in " traditional families " . Can't you put two and two together ? And Colson is not " opposing " the amendment . He's SUPPORTING it . From the article : " This is just one reason that I am so passionately in favor of the Marriage Protection Amendment ... " Can't you even get THAT right ? Or are you so lost in obfuscation that you've confused yourself ?
