S1 and S2 discuss the United States Constitutional legal system and whether and how same sex marriage can be banned.  S1 believes the concept of marriage has evolved dramatically over time and can now be declared by the Supreme Court to be a fundamental right not to be denied to same sex couples.   S2 believes it is a legislative matter which should be left to voting.  S1 argues that fundamental rights are protected by the Constitution and are not subject to a plebescite.  S2 accuses S1 of believing in an activist judiciary and evolving Constitutional standards which usurp the role of the legislature.  S2 also criticizes Loving v. Virginia as incorrect in reasoning and an example of judicial activism.

S1 thinks the definition of marriage is subject to change. As an example S1 points to an old definition of marriage in which a woman lost her identity into that of a man. S1 believes fundamental rights are not subject to vote and cites Loving v. Virginia as an example. He believes the courts are an intermediate body between the people and legislature; thus to ban gay marriage one must prove it isn't a right or give compelling evidence against it. S2 wonders what marriage being a fundamental right has to do with defining marriage. If marriage is subject to change then he asks how it is supposed to be changed if not by vote. He takes issue with the judiciary becoming the legislative branch.

The issue is here is the definition of marriage, and what government body/level has the right to change this definition.

Speaker one believes that courts and federal government should be able to rule on the definition of marriage and cites several previous cases in the past where the federal government stepped up to introduce legislature. This speaker believes that "fundamental rights" are not subject to state votes and can be decided by government.

Speaker two believes that each state should decide the definition of marriage and questions what "fundamental rights" have to do with the "definition" of marriage. This speaker believes that it should left up to a vote to decide the definition of marriage and that legislature should not be confused with judiciary.

Two people are discussing gay marriage laws.  S1 states that since the traditional definition of marriage is human made, it can be changed to meet changing times.  S2 contends that the legal definition is human made and can change, but since we're in a democracy it must change by vote.  He also states that so far votes favor a "one man one woman" definition of marriage.  S1 states that the courts were designed to be an intermediate between people and legislature, and if same gender marriage can be banned by state action it must be proven that marriage is not a fundamental right.  S2 states that by allowing this the judiciary branch becomes the legislative branch, which is not so.

Two people are debating gay marriage rights.  S1 is pro gay marriage while S2 appears against.  S1 feels the constitution can evolve with changing times because it is a man-made construct while S2 cites the fact 26 states still consider the sanctity of marriage to be one man and one woman.  Also advising a key point to the nation is the basis of laws being voted upon.  S2 does not feel S1's statements are correct regarding whether or not marriage is a right.  S1 sites Loving v. Virginia in argument marriage is not a human construct. S1 also advises marriage is a fundamental right and should be a fundamental right for all not to be determined by each state individually.
