S1 and S2 discuss the civil benefits of marriage and how they could or could not be extended to single people and gay people.  S1 is initially against government being involved in the equation, but after S2 describes many of the legal rights and benefits associated with marriage, such as automatic inheritance and hospital visitation rights, S1 is then able to relate to the issues by considering the case of his life-long bachelor uncle, suggesting that it is single people who are discriminated against by being excluded from the marriage benefits.  S2 suggests that if a single person desires the benefits of marriage, they should marry, but that they should be able to marry a person of either gender as they see fit.

S1 thinks that the government should stay out of marriage and that it should be left to religious institutions. He thinks there needs to be a better system and that single people are the ones that are harmed the most by marriage laws because they are unable to get any of the benefits that married people do even if they want them, or it is important to their situation. S2 says religious ceremonies aren't what gay people want because they already can have them via churches. They want the rights and to keep the government out would be to give up those rights. If single people want those rights they should get married, but he thinks you should be free to marry who you wish.

The issue here is whether government or religion should decides the principles of marriage, and who is allowed to get married.

Speaker one believes that leaving it up to religions groups does not satisfy what gays are looking for. They are searching for the civil benefits that come with a marriage and would like to be treated equally in that respect. The speaker believes gay should be able to marry a person of their choice and get equal rights.

Speaker two opinions that there should indeed be a better system for marriage benefits and that it is all "single" people that get screwed over by marriage's current stature. Speaker two believes that gay people should marry a woman if they want the same rights.

Two people are discussing the right to marry.  S1 states that marriage should be left to a religious institution where it would mean something.  S2 states that it is not the ceremonies that gays are looking for, it is all the civil benefits. S1 retorts that there should be a better system, that even allows single people with best friends access to the same benefits.  S2 retorts saying that gays are not single people, and single people can always get married.  S1 contradicts by saying that gay people should just marry the opposite sex, to which S2 states that gay people are seeking the right to marry a person of their choosing, not to just marry anyone for benefits.

Two subjects are discussing gay marriage.  S1 believes marriage should not be handled by state or legislature but instead be dealt with on a religious level.  S2 believes the religious aspect is not what gay couples are trying to be a part of.  He/she feels gay couples are more interested in the rights and benefits heterosexual couples are afforded such as insurance and in cases where the relationships dissolve, custody and visitation.  S1 contends he/she feels not there should be a ban on gay marriage but a better system to handle the types of situations which S1 describes.  S2 believes each person should be free to marry whoever he/she chooses as despite the reasoning for the marriage, it is commitment.
