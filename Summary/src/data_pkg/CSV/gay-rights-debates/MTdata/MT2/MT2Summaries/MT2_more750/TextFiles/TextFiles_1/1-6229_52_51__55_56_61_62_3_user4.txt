S1 asks S2 how equal marriage would hurt someone, “her”, or anyone else. S1’s way of equal marriage would not S1 or her. S1 is only concerned with gay rights and will talk people out of attending bible churches. S1 will try to legally disrupt any of the fundraising activities that they have going on, protest their weddings and their services. Once they crossed the line and enacted laws that hurt S1 and S1’s family, then they have no place in society. The majority should not have the right to enslave their fellow citizens and send them to concentration camps. She should admit to her bigotry, discrimination and anti-gay views.


S2 is glad that S1 abandoned a silly argument about the violation of the first amendment right, but still does not see why only laws that do not cause harm should be enacted. S2 is surprised at S1’s affinity for the harm principle given that S1 has expressed being at war with evangelical anti-gay christianity. S2 holds that people should be about to legislate their views, and wants S1 to explain why that shouldn’t be so with anti-gay people. In a democracy like ours people use the democratic process to have views enacted into law. If she is free to do this, then so is S1.
