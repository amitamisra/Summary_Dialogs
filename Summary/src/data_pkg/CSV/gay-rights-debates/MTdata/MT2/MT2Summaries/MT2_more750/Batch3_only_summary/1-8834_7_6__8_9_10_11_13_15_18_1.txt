S1: Legally, it is complicated to legalize gay marriage in all states, as DOMA is in place and states have chosen not to recognize other state's marriages for decades.  Attempts abide by the FFC clause to in respect to marriage (even before DOMA) require such lengthy legal arguments that they are rendered prohibitive. The choice of law doctrine must be considered and DOMA could be found to be unconstitutional by vote of the SCOTUS. How will states use the choice of law doctrine so that the FFC clause does not apply? 

S2: If Congress removes DOMA, a vote for legal gay marriage will pass quickly, and certain justices of SCOTUS already approve of gay marriage. DOMA has yet to be declared unconstitutional because there has yet to be a case made to challenge DOMA in the courts, so it has not been decided upon by SCOTUS. The choice of law doctrine trumps the FFC clause in cases of marriage contract and there is a current tradition of respecting other states marriage licenses for

Two people are discussing gay marriage.  S1 states that in the next 20 years the wave of gay marriage legalization will be over, to which S2 states that if Congress removes the Defense of Marriage Act, the full faith and credit clause is a clear constitutional mandate.  S1 rebuts saying that even without the federal DOMA, the choice of law doctrine means that states can choose not to recognize gay marriage, or even be forced to recognize another state's gay marriage.  He also states that the full faith and credit clause has never been used in that way, and due to the lengthy legal argument involved it is unlikely to be used.  To contradict this, S2 states that each Justice will vote to side with gay marriage, and there is a current tradition of one state respecting another's marriage license when it comes to heteros, a tradition that will be kept if gay marriage laws are passed.

S1 believes New England and New York will pass gay marriage and the West Coast will as well; however, S1 also believes the influx of states to recognize the unions will drop off for as many as 30 years.  S1 also believes the removal of DOMA will not effect the outcome nationally advising each state has a right to pass or not pass in the state as well as the fact one state does not have to recognize another state's laws; meaning, just because someone is married in New York does not mean Pennsylvania would have to recognize that marriage. S1 feels courts will rely upon choice of law doctrine for guidance.

S2 does not agree with this information and believes if DOMA is removed gay marriage will be passed nation wide.  S2 also feels the majority of Justices will vote pro gay marriage should DOMA be removed from the equation.  Also, there is a belief each state will eventually recognize the unions entered into in states which do allow gay marriage.

S1 and S2 are pondering the future of gay marriage laws in the United States.  S1 posits that States on the East and West Coasts will have gay marriage laws, but that mosts states will be able to prevent them with laws of their own which define marriage as between a man and a woman.  S2 is optimistic that the Supreme Court will find State laws that ban gay marriage unconstitutional if Congress acts to remove DOMA [Defense of Marriage Act].  S1 questions why the Court doesn't find DOMA unconstitutional, to which S2 asserts it has not had the opportunity to do so yet.  S2 also argues that choice of law rules in the various States will result in gay marriages not being recognized in States where there is no gay marriage, and that States have historically already done so on that basis.  He further asserts that resort to choice of law rules means that the FFC [Full Faith and Credit Clause] of the Constitution is not addressed in this context.

S1 believes that new England and New York will have gay marriage within the next few years and that the west coast might come soon after. They argue that after this time period, gay marriage legislation will stop for the next twenty years or so and that thirty states already define marriage as between one man and one woman. They do not believe that the supreme court would overturn gay marriage bans as unconstitutional and believes that states will ultimately be the ones to recognize whether it should be legal or not. They argue that current marriage laws are disputed between states and have been for decades and believes that the courts will be unable to intervene.
S2 believes that a federal recognition of gay marriage will be soon coming, and argues against S1's claims on the basis of Roberts and Alito being constitutional literalists. They believe that there is enough support in the Supreme Court to follow the constitution as written and that it will find any laws prohibiting gay marriage unconstitutional as a result.
