This seems to be an argument about gay rights and generalizing the political beliefs of people. According to S1, S2 talks about Paul Cameron and makes it seem as if he is the voice of the Republicans. S1 argues that it is not the case and one person who sides with a specific party doesn't represent the party. S1 uses John Lennon as an example of this not being a proper way to generalize political views of parties, in his case the Democratic party. S1 accuses S2 of making an assertion including the Republicans creating another Holocaust, because of the generalization that S2 made. S2 believes that Paul Cameron's views are cited and used in many cases against gay rights because most people do share the same views, which S1 thinks otherwise. S2 says that most attacks on gay rights have cited Paul Cameron, even within the US Senate, showing that he has a strong opinion in the Republican party, or at least it seems so.
