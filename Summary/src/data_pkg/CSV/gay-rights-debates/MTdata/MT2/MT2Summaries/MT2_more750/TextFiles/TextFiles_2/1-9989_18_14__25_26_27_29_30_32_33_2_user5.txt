S1 says he served Uncle Sam and fought for his freedom of speech right unlike other people. S2 is amused at S1’s statement yet he doesn’t feel gays should be able to serve in the military of have freedom of speech. S2 also says S1 didn’t actually fight for his freedom of speech but was guaranteed it by the constitution which applies to all Americans including gays. S2 questions S1 to why there should be consequences on earth because S1 believes it is wrong according to his religious book. S2 tells S1 that he has no evidence of what he claims but asks S2 why all Americans should believe S1’s book. S2 says the power of the government comes from the people and his fight is again bigots who feels that they can use their personal beliefs to dictate what other may or may not do. S1 questions S2 as to who is he to decide what religious-minded people can and cannot do and says S2’s personal bigotry is getting to him.
