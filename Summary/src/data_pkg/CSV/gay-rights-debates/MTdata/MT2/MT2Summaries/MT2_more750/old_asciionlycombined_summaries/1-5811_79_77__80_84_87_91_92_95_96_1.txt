S1: Religion is a good tool to guide one's own actions, but not for telling others how to live. People have been prejudiced against homosexuals for a long time. Moral or religious prejudice is still prejudice. A person can claim a moral or religious stance without having one. You cannot justify an anti-gay agenda on morals or religion. An anti-gay stance on the grounds of religious belief is prejudice. Prejudice based on religious belief implies that a religious person's acts of prejudice could have a negative impact on homosexuals, because they believe that being gay is morally reprehensible. 
 
S2: Prejudice is a fact of human existence. Christianity is a moral system. When people claim religion in morals, they abandon that moral system. It is religious belief - not prejudice - that makes one take an anti-gay stance. The Bible says that homosexuality is wrong, so if you believe in the Bible as your moral canon, then you believe that homosexuality is wrong as well.

Two people are discussing gay marriage.  S1 believes that the anti-gay agenda is based on prejudice, and that simply calling something moral or religious does not mean it can't be prejudice at the same time.  He contends that people who justify the anti-gay agenda claim a moral or religious stance without having one. He also states that he has never seen someone justify an anti-gay agenda based solely on morals or religion. S2 retorts by stating that when people claim religion in doing prejudice they are actually abandoning their morals, and prejudice is not what's behind people's opposition to gays being in romantic relationships.  He states that the simple reason is because it's Biblical; the Bible says it shouldn't be done so it shouldn't be done.  S2 then points out that if that is someone's belief then that's fine, but banning someone else from doing it due to that belief is imposing their views on others, which is wrong.

S1 believes it is prejudice as opposed to religious or moral beliefs which fuel the anti-gay agenda; advising a moral-bases system does not allow for the intentional targeting of another and also religion could be cited but is not based upon dictating how another should live.  S1 believes all religious based arguments regarding gay issues eventually circle around to prejudice and invites S2 to support the religious argument without this happening.  S1 advises there is no issue with people who do not try to push their views on others.

S2 concedes religion is not to blame in and of itself and eludes to the point that often times people who are claiming a religious or moral reason for their actions are doing so after having gone against the premise on which their belief is based.  S2 also advises he/she is against same sex relationships because the Bible says it's wrong but does not impose his/her beliefs on others and is not prejudice.  S2 refuses to give the summary of their religious argument.

S1 and S2 are discussing anti-gay bias and the nature of prejudice versus valid religious beliefs.  S1 believes it is prejudicial to hold anti-gay opinions, whether based on religious values or otherwise, and use them to impose ones views on another. S2 agrees that religious belief can be improperly used as the pretext for acts of prejudice against the gay community, but proposes that only people who are lying about having religious values against homosexuality should be accused of being prejudiced.  S2 asserts vaguely that her belief that "Christ is a resurrected being" somehow absolves her of prejudice in being generally opposed to homosexuality.  S1 seems inclined to grant her leeway based on such a religious objection, but requests more specifics as to why a Christian must oppose homosexuality and admonishes S1 not to actively agitate against the gay community or advocate for public policies which are discriminatory.  S1 is opposed to groups such as "Focus on the Family" (may be a misnomer) who attempt to impose their views on others.

S1 believes that people can be prejudiced without having a true religious or moral reasoning behind it, and that sometimes those that do are claiming that they do falsely. This person believes that anti-homosexual sentiments are based on prejudice and that those who oppose homosexual lifestyles use religion and morals as an excuse to say that they aren't actually prejudiced. This person voices a displeasure in those who would press their own personal biases upon others, especially when using morals or religion as reasons for doing so.
S2 believes that people can have a strong moral or religious belief and not be prejudiced. This person does not approve of a homosexual lifestyle and argues that it is not because of prejudice but because of his or her personal religious beliefs. He or she, however, states that they have no desire to impose such beliefs on anyone else. This person believes that what they personally believe is not what everyone else does, and agrees that people can falsely claim a moral or religious opposition to homosexual lifestyles.
