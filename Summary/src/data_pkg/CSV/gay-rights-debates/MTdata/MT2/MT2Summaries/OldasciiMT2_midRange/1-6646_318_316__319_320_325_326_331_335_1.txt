S1 claims that his opposition to gay marriage is based on the belief that it will hurt more people than it helps, not on bigotry. He suggests that it would hurt people with a traditional view of marriage as between a man and a woman, and that the benefits of marriage can be gained by homosexuals without redefining marriage.
S2 argues that gay marriage does not hurt anyone, straight or gay, and offending proponents of traditional marriage is not a valid argument against it. He believes that preventing gay marriage is simply faith based hate. He claims that having separate rules for straight and gay marriage creates the possibility of those rules being different for the two groups, allowing the gay minority to be disenfranchised.

S1 believes since gay couples qualify for the same benefits as married heterosexual couples there is no reason to allow for gay marriage advising his/her agreeing with these points does not make him/her a bigot.  S1 feels supporting arguments with logic eliminates the ability to label one as a bigot.

S2 feels not redefining marriage to allow for same sex couples to unite leaves the door open for gay couples to not be given the same rights and benefits as hetero couples.  He/she believes as long as there is a separate set of standards there can be rule changes to prevent their benefits. S2 concedes that S1 is not labeled as a bigot but supports those who are in a sense bigots or supporters.

Two people are discussing about redefining the meaning of marriage.  S1 thinks that it is unnecessary to redefine marriage to include gays.  He states that all of the rights and benefits that married couples have are already granted to gays without the need for redefining.  Redefining only serves to hurt the many people who see marriage as a sacred bond between man and woman.  S2 thinks that it is necessary to redefine marriage. If not, the rights and benefits granted to gays will not be guaranteed.  Also, he believes that offending someone's sensibility is not real, measurable damage, so there is not reason not to redefine marriage, not doing so only appeases faith justified hate.

S1 believes that gay marriage will hurt more people than it helps, and that the benefits deserved by homosexuals can be had without redefining marriage. They believe that it hurts people who view marriage as a sacred bond between a man and a woman. They believe that homosexuals are entitled to their rights, but do not need to redefine marriage in order to get them.
S2 does not believe that offending one group of individuals counts as damage, but they do believe that appeasing faith justified hate does. They don't believe people are interested in giving homosexuals marriage rights under a different name, and also don't believe people wish to grant them any rights at all. They believe separate rules will be too easy to manipulate.

S1 believes that a big 'bunch' of people cherish the notion that marriage is a sacred bond of union between a man and a woman. Redefining marriage to include same-sex couples upsets the sensitivities of these people. This is unnecessary because it is possible for gay couples to obtain rights similar to married couples without having to redefine marriage.
S2 asserts that redefining marriage to include same-sex couples does not harm anyone. He said that offending the sensibilities of people does not constitute harm. He claims that evidence show that the majority of people do not want to grant same-sex couples rights similar to marriage under a separate label. Hence gays have to resort to redefining marriage to secure legal rights under the marriage arrangement.
