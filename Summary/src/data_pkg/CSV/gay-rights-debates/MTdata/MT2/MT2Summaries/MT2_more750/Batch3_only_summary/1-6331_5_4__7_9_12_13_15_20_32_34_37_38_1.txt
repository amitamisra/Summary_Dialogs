S1: Opposers to gay marriage often jump to conclusions about who can get married -why not cousins, group marriages, children, dogs? Polygamous marriage raises legal concerns that are not currently covered in traditional marriage laws, for example. The goal of gay marriage supporters is to be able to get married - not to broaden marriage. Broadened marriage is a side effect of legal gay marriage.

S2: Gay marriage supporters want marriage laws changed to accommodate gay marriage. Broadened marriage could change the current traditional marriage laws. Polygamy, for example, would require more marriage laws changed than gay marriage would, as more people are involved. But if enough people wanted legal polygamous marriage, the laws would be passed. Marriage would be broadened if gay marriage is made legal, whether that is the goal of gay marriage or not.

Two people are discussing gay marriage and its possible consequences.  S1 contends that our current marriage benefit laws are set up for two adults running a household, so recognising group marriages is a huge task. He points out that even though its for one man and wife, that is not a necessity and would be a much easier task than allowing group marriages.  He argues that the purpose of what gays are trying to do is to get married, and a side effect is that people will see it as the scope of marriage being broadened.  But, broadening marriage to include polygamy and other types of marriages is a side effect that doesn't need to be accepted.  S2 contends that cultural and legal precedent is very real, and that intent is irrelevant.  This is because by seeking gay marriage, the boundaries of what defines marriage is widening to include more than opposite-sex couples and because that, gays are broadening marriage, which inevitably leads to broadening in the other areas.

S1 believes changing the law to outline group marriages would be a tedious task.  S1 believes transforming to open ended would open the door for other issues such as children being allowed to marry.  S1 believes those who practice other types of unions are using same sex marriage to open the door for other types of unions to be accepted and recognized as well. S1 believes this is the reason most people do not want to broach the subject of polygamist unions advising the goes is not to broaden marriage.

S2 feels laws will need to be changed to tailor to same sex marriages and the same courtesy should be extended to polygamous marriage.  S2 argues that society can deal with the issue of polygamy without opening the flood gates to include groups such as children, family members, and animals. S2 argues if the institution of marriage is to be changed to include same sex couples, there is no choice but to also face the subject of other types of unions as well.

S1 (Kronos) and S2 (Jyoshu) are discussing the fact that there are other groups besides the gay community who may want marriage equality rights, such as polygamy advocates or 17 year olds.  Jyoshu sees the changes in law that would be required as an attack on social and legal precedent that can get out of control or be difficult to implement.  Kronos complains that this is a frequent tactic of anti-gay marriage advocates who unfairly claim  that gays want to "make marriage an open ended institution."  Jyoshu notes that whatever the intent, the result is the kind of change the anti-gay advocates warn against.  Kronos asserts that specific laws could accommodate specific groups.  He also argues that the motivation of gays who wish to marry is sincere and the same as the motivation behind opposite sex marriages, and therefore the broadening of marriage is a side effect and not the goal.  Jyoshu says she understands but complains that gay marriage would open the door to further broadening of marriage.

S1 argues that group marriages would not make sense under current marriage laws, as they only account for two individuals in a legal marriage. They state that opponents of homosexual marriage tend to argue that a change to marriage law would make it too open ended. This person does not believe that to be true, and argues that homosexuals are not trying to broaden the scope of marriage, but only change the law to be inclusive of themselves. They believe that bringing up hypothetical arguments to the contrary is a distraction.
S2 argues that an effect of homosexuals being allowed to legally marry would lead to even more changes to marriage laws that would include more than simply homosexual relationships. This person believes that allowing homosexual marriage is a case that broadens marriage and if allowed, can open basis for future arguments to broaden the law further. They firmly believe that marriage as an institution is between a heterosexual male and female and that changing that in any way gives legal grounds to continue changing it.
