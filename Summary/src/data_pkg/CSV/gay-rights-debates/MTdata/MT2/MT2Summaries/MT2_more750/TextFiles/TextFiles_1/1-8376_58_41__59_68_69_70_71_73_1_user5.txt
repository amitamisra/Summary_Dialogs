S1 and S2 are talking about what marriage means to the government. S1 says his marriage has nothing to do with the government. S2 believes that marriage is one of the foundations of social stability. S1 and S2 are both not surprised if the government gets involved in marriage. S2 is upset that Christians are demanding the government to “get out of marriage” because gay people want to get in it. He believes the government does not need to get involved with the regulation and support of marriage and why the society should prevent it. S1 believes the government getting out of marriage is not a bad idea. S1 and S2 start arguing about marriage benefits between single people and married. S1 argues government support of marriage is unfair to single people and S2 argues single people do not have the same issues as married people. They give examples of their own married and single life. They both compare marriage to marriage to woods and trees.
