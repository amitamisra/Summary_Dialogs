S1, a heterosexual, and S2, a homosexual, discuss the justness of the legislative process, majority rule, and how the latter affects individuals and the gay community.  S2 describes how the gay community is discriminated against, and posits that because laws regarding homosexuals impact them more directly than the general population, it is unfair to have a majority rule apply.  S1 accuses S2 of not understanding the legal system and proposes that S2 find majority to have legislation passed, and not look to the courts to redress the discrimination.  S1 analogizes that process to how slavery was abolished, and also analogizes the alleged oppression to the oppression that may be felt by anti-abortion advocates and child molesters as a result of majority rule.

S1 believes that the majority rules no matter what the minority thinks. He thinks this is the way the law works and that it doesn't matter how an individual feels. It matters what the majority votes on. He cites slavery as an example. If someone wants a law changed S1 thinks they should get the majority to side with them and change it. S2 thinks that S1 doesn't understand because he is heterosexual and not the one being oppressed. S2 believes that the courts should look at individuals lives and the effect of laws on everyone. He thinks if a law is unjust then it should be overturned regardless of what the majority wants. He thinks conservatives are heartless and don't care if people suffer.

Speaker one is a heterosexual who believes that in our democratic society, the majority rules, and that this majority has so far consistently ruled again gay rights. Speaker one believes that courts should not overturn decisions based off the minority complaining and should abide by the majority, how our constitution and government was designed.

Speaker two believes that the majority is oppressing the LGBT community and being treated as second-class citizens. The speaker believes that if a law effects an individuals' life in an unjust way, then it is courts responsibility to overrule it for the individual's sake. Speaker two believes society is oppressing people, and that if a law adversely effects even one person, it is unjust.

Two people are discussing gay marriage laws.  S1 contends that the current system the most votes win, to which S2 contends that the laws should be decided based on looking at the individuals that are affected.  S1 states that if one wants to change the law, he must get a majority of people to do it, and the majority should not be ignored because someone objects to them.  S2 states that the courts should look at the individual lives that will be affected and decide, and that laws that a majority favors that are unjust in an individuals life must be overruled.  S1 rebuts that that goes against how the courts were designed to work.

Two subjects are discussing a law banning gay marriage.  S2 believes the law is unjust as it segregates the gay community from that of the heterosexual community.  S1 supports the nation's ability to vote on such issues and supports the "majority rules" philosophy. S2 believes the courts should take individuals' into consideration and rule on each instead of as a whole.  S1 contends this idea to be incorrect citing the fact that those who believe abortion should be illegal are technically the minority and that a court would not rule on that issue individually.  S1 feels S2 and others like him/her support society's oppression of certain groups.  S1 disagrees advising he/she wants only a society free to vote on laws.
