S1 and S2 are debating whether making gay marriage legal will open opportunities for other "taboos" in our society. S1 believes that in opening this opportunity for gay marriage, the definition of marriage will change and it will allow other issues like incest and polygamy to become legal. S2 accuses S1 of hypocracy. In a sense, they believe gay marriage will have a sort of domino effect for other issues. S1 is arguing that using these other issues to be evidence for why gay-marriage shouldn't be allowed is not a valid argument. Then S1 goes on to say that this tactic is used to instill fear to those who do not support those other issues. S1 understands the other issues, but doesn't see the relationship between those and that of same-sex marriage. S2 keeps arguing that it shouldnt be different figuring out whether one can approve gay marriage but not incest since they believe the two to be somewhat related.

 S1 and S2 discuss same-sex marriage. S1 is for gay marriage, and opens the discussion by showing logical fallacies used by the opposition to deter people from believing gay marriage is an extension of equal rights.  S1 believes that modern families are not traditional families and are often better off for it. S1 specifically points out the comparison of gay marriage to incest or polygamy. S1 says this is a scare tactic to turn people away. S2 believes that homosexuality, incest, and polygamy are all related because they are all taboos of society. S2 wants to draw the line as is so the definition of marriage does not change. If it does change then there would be no limit to who could marry.  S1 explains that love is present in all marriage so the claims made by S2 about gay marriage leading to incest, could be used for straight marriage as well. S2 attacks S1 and thinks that if the other parties mentioned went and paraded their lifestyle then they would also have an equal opportunity to make their marriage a social issue.

(S1) begins talking about how we benefit from what is considered common, such as a nuclear family and how it is composed. He also says that it's right it has nothing to do with the bible however; it has everything to do with slippery slop logical fallacy. Then, gives the example of how incest and polygamy is less socially accepted in comparison to gay marriage. And so, it rebuttals the argument using both issues with equal weight because it scares some people away who might not have much knowledge about the topics.  (S2) states that a married couple is considered a nuclear family and that marriage is a legal institution. (S2) poses the question of weather it's acceptable for gay marriage to be accepted but not the other because they are less popular and if so why? (S1) answers that those issues do not relate specifically to gay legal marriage and that many attempt to use those issues similarly to argue against gay marriage.  (S2) brings up the question of what is socially accepted and the types of taboo relationship and legality. (S1) says that love is not exceptionally for gay people but also others. Also that taboos are constructed on the basis of peoples reasoning, indications and practices. (S2) keeps arguing why is anestrous taboo and not gay marriage?

S1 thinks that we don't just benefit from what is often considered the common , nuclear family . We benefit from families with adopted children , step children , families with no children at all . S1 believes that marriage has nothing to do with the bible. Then what may lead to incest and polygamy doesn't relate specifically to gay legal marriage at all. S1 is trying to show that people who are against gay marriage try to dissuade others by attempting to incite fear by spouting off a parade of horribles that have nothing to do with the issue of gay marriage . S1 holds that love applies to straight marriages as well as gay marriages and that love is not exclusive to gay marriages. It is fallacious to believe that love will lead to a slippery slope. Those against gay marriage use logical fallacies.
 
 
 S2 does not see the logic in bringing up sibling marriages and is curious to know how S1 would respond to such movements. S2 does not believe that what people do in their private lives is anyone else's business. What may lead to incestuous marriage is if siblings or related people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage. What may lead to polygamous marriage is 3 or more people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . Gay marriage was considered just as much a taboo as incest or polygamy just a few years ago. S2 does not understand why it is  ok to deny incestuous relations the right to marry on the grounds that it is considered taboo , but ok to approve gay marriage on the same grounds.

S1 says we benefit from families with adopted children, step children, or families with no children at all. Marriage has nothing to do with the bible and everything to do with the slippery slope logical fallacy. S2 believes a married couple as the head of a home is considered a nuclear family because is already that the question of legality. He questions S1 if he is trying to say because gay marriage is less acceptable than incestuous relations that it is okay to grant gay marriage but not sibling marriage. According to S1, incest and polygamy doesn't relate specifically to gay legal marriage. S2 questions to what exactly does the social acceptance of any type of "taboo" relationship have to do with their right to be legally married. S2 believes  that gay marriage will change the definition of marriage from "a legal union between man and woman" to "a legal union between any parties that love each other". He poses the question if it is okay for two people to tie the knot then how could incest be  taboo.
