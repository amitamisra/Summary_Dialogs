S1 claims that the gay community is the cause of the AIDs epidemic in the US and that homosexuals and their advocates attempt to divert attention from this fact by tracing the origin of the disease to Africa. He believes that the existence of AIDs in Africa has nothing to do with AIDs in the US and that it should be ignored.
S2 argues that discussing AIDs in Africa is relevant to AIDs in the US and point out how AIDs is used as a justification for those who oppose gay rights. He suggests that the statistics regarding AIDs in Africa show that it is not simply a homosexual disease and that AIDs should therefore not be used as a justification to make gay marriage illegal.

S1 feels the topic of AIDS in the U.S. being spread by the gay community is avoiding by returning to the argument that AIDS originated in Africa.  S1 requests factual proof that his groups' statements are untrue.  He/she advises citing feelings or wants is not providing proof but deflecting the topic.

S2 argues that by blaming the gay community for AIDS' spreading in America, S1's group is opening the door for the argument that the disease originated elsewhere.  S2 feels the opposing group is using the spread of AIDS as a basis for banning gay marriage. He/she feels doing so is like saying if a bus hit a group of people in Africa, then buses should be banned in New York.

Two people are discussing the spread of AIDS in the US as part of a discussion on gay marriage in the USA. S1 states that location is relevant, as the way AIDS spread in Africa is different from how it spreads in the US. He continues to state that AIDS spread in the US because of the gay community, and the gay community continually tries to deflect the argument and include Africa in the discussion instead of providing real facts.  S2 argues that bringing up the topic of AIDS is solely as a weapon against gays, and that the location of the AIDS epidemic is irrelevant to the discussion. He then states that Africa is included in order to refute the opposing logic.

S1 believes that those who defend homosexual activity deflect the question of an AIDS epidemic in the United States by bringing up statistics for it in Africa. They believe that such arguments have no place in an argument about homosexual marriage and are blatant attempts to sidetrack the argument. They believe that AIDS became an epidemic in the United States through the homosexual male community, and that all evidence should be contained and localized in the United States when arguing a point.
S2 refutes this by stating that statistics in Africa are brought up to counter arguments that blame the homosexual community for the United States epidemic. They believe that if one broaches the topic of AIDS one must also look at it as a whole.

S1 asserts that AIDS became an epidemic in the US through the gay community. He accuses S2 of changing the topic to AIDs in Africa to deflect attention from the topic of AIDs in the US. He challenges S2 to refute his assertion with proof. S1 said that he is not a bigot, but that he is just presenting a fact of how AIDs became an epidemic in the US through the gay community. S2 asserts that S1 did not present his statistics as a discussion about the progression of AIDS in the US. Rather, S1 presented his statistics to justify opposition to gay rights. S2 brought out AIDs in Africa because location is irrelevant in refuting S1's logic.
