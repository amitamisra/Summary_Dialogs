This is about politics and whether or not the lie in order to get more votes. S1 believes politicians sometimes may lie as long as its what is the majority, while S2 is saying that S2 is more concerned with the honesty of the candidates rather than whether they are lying or not. S2 says we should expect them to be honest, because that is what we should want from politicians. S1 argues that politicians seem to lie in order to get the position they want or sway people to become popular, while S2 thinks that we should rely on them to make the right decision. S1 seems to think that S2 is making an argument for their belief, but S2 is just trying to be honest and show the other perspective. They argue about politicians lying through discussing when politicians are asked questions and how they answer them. S2 finishes by telling S1 we should not label politicians and expect them to do and say the right, honest thing.
