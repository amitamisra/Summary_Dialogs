 S1 and S2 are debating the topic of what marriage should mean to our government. S1 Believes it is not a bad idea because they think it is not necessary for the government to be involved in most aspects of our lives, while S2 is questioning why it's necessary to try and remove government involvement when it is unavoidable. S1 brings up that because several people are against the government due to gay marriage and not because it's just marriage altogether, it doesn't mean it's not a bad idea to remove government intervention. S1 mentions the "Healthy Marriage Initiative" and how it isn't necessary. S2 says that there is too much legal work and documents behind marriage in the government, such as inheritance, pension and social rights, etc., and that it would be a lot more work if the government didn't intervene, also stating that removing marriage from government will only benefit lawyers. Both S1 and S2 have had experience with marriage, S2 states that marriage benefits are good because of government intervention.

 This discussion is about the government roll in marriage, specifically pertaining to homosexual marriage. S1 believes that the government should have no say in marriage. S2 believes that government should have a say in marriage because it is more practical in today's world. S1 believes that individual contracts by lawyers  rather than the government being involved would be the fairest compromise. S2 encountered problems with this view in their personal life when their partner died, and they were unable to sort out all of the legal issues involved in death, like inheritance, or social security rights.  S2 believes there will be privileges that come only in government recognized unions. S1 comments best way to go about solving these problems is to take them one issue at a time rather then facing the problem as a whole. S2 thinks that you need to look at situations in from different perspectives like trees in the woods.  Both S1 and S2 have previous experience with married life and single life.

 S1 Questions the role of government in marriage, maintaining that it should have a very limited one. S1 says that governments want to be involved in our lives as much as they can be, and that getting the government out of marriage getting the government out of marriage would be a good idea even if people are supporting this change for the wrong reasons. It is not necessary to have government in marriage and citizens should be vigilant in making sure that the government does not intrude where it is not needed. S1 believes that single people have the biggest stake in this issue. 
 
 
 S2 criticizes the new push for government getting out of marriage. S2 talks about marriage being an ancient tradition, based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans, and that is one of the foundations for social stability. It is thought that it would be natural for the government to want to support it and that it should because the government is the source of law. Replacing marriage would mean a plethora of minor and specific legal contracts to cover all the hundreds of rights and mutual obligations currently conferred by marriage. Legal issues such as inheritance, pension and social security rights, adoption, custody, and home ownership that would need separate contracts without the umbrella of marriage. Marriage is more convenient.
