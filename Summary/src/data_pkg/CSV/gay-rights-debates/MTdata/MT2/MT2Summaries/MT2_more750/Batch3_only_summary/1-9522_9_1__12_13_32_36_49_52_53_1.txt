S1: Washington DC' s city council recently legalized gay marriage. People's support of gay marriage has been growing steadily in the past ten years, and will soon be the majority opinion. Five states have already legalized gay marriage. Those opposed to gay marriage may view gays as promiscuous and sexual deviants, but most gay men are assuredly quite normal. Civil unions will not be accepted in place of marriage, as they do not allow the same legal rights as marriage.
 
S2:  Councils and legislatures may vote in favor of gay marriage, but it has yet to be the majority vote of the people. Gay marriage should be played in a positive light by its supporters, because the current public perception of gay men is that they are promiscuous and lead a "gay lifestyle" that is offensive. Anti-gay marriage supporters will support civil unions in lieu of gay marriage, and homosexuals should be satisfied with that.

Two people are discussing gay marriage.  S1 states that people in support of marriage equality is growing, and he contends that equality will soon stand on the side of the majority.  S2 retorts that gays lose every time gay marriage is put to a vote in a ballot, and that gays need a better PR strategy.  He also states that majority of people will support civil unions with the same benefits but not marriage and there will be repercussions due to the efforts to give tax money to federal employee's same sex partners despite the Defense of Marriage Act.  To contradict, S2 states that so far 5 states have passed gay marriage laws, and that gay people pay their taxes just like everyone else.  He also states that the gay community is not a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people.  S1 rebutts by stating that in those 5 states, gay marriage was not put to a ballot, but forced through the court or legislature.

S1 announces the vote to support gay marriage in DC and congratulates the District.  S1 feels the majority of society does support marriage equality and will vote for it advising five states had already voted for and passed same sex unions.  S1 advises they would be happy to accept the title Civil Union as long as the same rights were extended which are given to hetero couples.  S1 also acknowledges the negative image gays have received is part of the reason some will not accept the concept of gay marriage an advises work is needed to change these stereotypes in order to move forward.

S2 believes once brought to a public vote, marriage equality will not be passed and believes a majority of people would support civil unions but not marriage of same sex couples due to insurance benefits and other benefits afforded to married couples.  He/she does not support the argument of five states having voted on gay marriage but instead believes these were passed without a ballot vote. S2 agrees.

S1 has posted news of the DC Council voting to authorize gay marriage and is celebratory about it.  S2 (JP) asserts that the politicians will pay a price and that the matter will be overturned when it is put to a vote.  He argues that a majority of people, including himself, would support laws providing rights and benefits for gays who elect to enter into civil unions, but not gay marriage.  He asserts no electorate would vote for gay marriage.  S1 refutes the suggestion by noting that 5 States had already approved gay marriage.  He also notes that gay marriage laws would not force heterosexuals to enter into them or attend gay weddings.  S2 seemingly corrects S1 by noting that the States in question had not put the issue to the general public for a vote.  S1 states that he would be happy with civil union laws, and each of them agree that the gay community has a PR problem and that many homosexuals are actually boring and inconspicuous.

S1 believes that since support for marriage equality is growing, it is only a matter of time before the majority votes in its favor. This person uses the DC council votes as evidence to support this as well as the fact that five states have passed gay marriage legislation. They state that any step towards viewing homosexuals as normal people is a good thing, and that even viewing civil unions in a positive light would and could be enough.
S2 does not believe that marriage equality is something that the majority of the voters wish to see enacted. This person argue that any legislation put into motion has been pushed around the voters, and never accounted for on an actual ballot. They refute S1's argument that five states have passed gay marriage legislation on the grounds that it was not done via the voters, and never actually put on a ballot. They argue that if homosexuals were willing to simply accept civil unions that are equivalent to marriage, they might find stronger grounds for legal acceptance.
