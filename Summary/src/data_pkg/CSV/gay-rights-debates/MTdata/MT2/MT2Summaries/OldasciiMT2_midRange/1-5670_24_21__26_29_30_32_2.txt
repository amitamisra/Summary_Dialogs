S1 argues that most people in the country might identify as Christian and that questioning a study is a very appropriate response to one that vilifies a group of people. They believe that there is a lot of attention given to trying to make Christianity look bad through generalization, irrelevant studies and misinterpretations. They believe the divorce rate of Christians has no bearing on the gay marriage amendment.
S2 believes that S1 is making up objections and deciding without any factual evidence. He or she believes that objections should not be hypothetical, but actual proven ones. This person thinks that dismissing results, rather than checking validity is reactionary. This person thinks it is relevant as long as people say they are protecting the sanctity of marriage.

S1 claims that the problem with an unmentioned study is that the majority of people identify as Christian, but he also recognizes S2's argument that more details of the study would be helpful to determine whether this is actually a problem. S1 also claims that the forum tends to make Christianity look bad, and points out that the divorce rate of Christians is irrelevant to the gay marriage amendment. 
S2 defends the unmentioned study by suggesting that S1 is unaware of the particular details of the study which could invalidate his argument. He also suggests that S1 dismissed the results of the study without trying to understand them, and that the study was in fact well done and any objections should be based on evidence.

S1 is uncomfortable with the study because there isn't information on how they got the results. S1 goes on to say the study vilifies a group of people, namely Christians, and that most people in the country may identify as Christian. S1 also thinks the divorce rate of Christians has no bearing on the issue of gay marriage. S2 thinks S1 should ask questions about the study rather than just assume it is incorrect and that it isn't being used to vilify anyone. S1 thinks the results are professional and S1 is just uncomfortable with the results. S2 thinks the divorce rate of Christians is very important to the issue because Christians say they are protecting the "sanctity" of marriage.

S1 feels much more clarification is needed as to how the study was conducted and who conducted it.  S1 also feels forums such as this one spend too much time attempting to make Christians look bad.  S1 also feels that divorce rates among Christians has nothing to do with the issue of gay marriage. S1 accuses S2 of being a reactionist.

S2 believes S1 is bringing up random,factless arguments without factual information arguing the study seems to be well and professionally done.  S2 also feels that the issues are being dismissed by S1 instead of being met by providing a valid argument.  S2 believes citing the protection of the sanctity of marriage makes the study's arguments relevant by supporting their arguments.

Two people are discussing the validity of a gay marriage study.  S1 states that a problem with the study is that most people in the country identifies as Christian. S2 states that since the specifics are unknown, questioning them would just be making up objections without factual evidence.  S1 states that questioning a study is appropriate, especially if it vilifies a group of people.  S2 contradicts, stating that the study was done professionally, stating that no one is vilifying anyone.  S1 states that the divorce rate of Christians has nothing to do with gay marriage, to which S2 states that as long as they're trying to protect marriage by keeping gays out, it's relevant.
