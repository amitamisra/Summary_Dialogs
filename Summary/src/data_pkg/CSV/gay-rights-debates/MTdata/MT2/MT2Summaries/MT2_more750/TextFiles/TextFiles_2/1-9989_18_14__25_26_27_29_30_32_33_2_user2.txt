S1 and S2 enter a discussion on gay rights and religion impact of legislation. S1 served in the military and they believed they have earned their right to have freedom of speech. S2 points out that gays should be able to do the same but are unable to due to prejudice due to policies that keep gay people from being open about their sexuality. S2 explains to S1 that the right to freedom of speech is guaranteed by the Constitution and gay are not being protected.  S1 is fine with gay serving in the military as long as they stay in closet or they should be kicked out. S2 argues that it is unfair to have laws based on religious text that does serve as everyoneâ€™s religious text.  S1 responds angrily and with homosexual slurs, and requests that S2 take his comments up with Obama. S2 explains his goal is too preach to the public and not to any specific person.  S1 believes S2 is being prejudice against religious-minded people.
