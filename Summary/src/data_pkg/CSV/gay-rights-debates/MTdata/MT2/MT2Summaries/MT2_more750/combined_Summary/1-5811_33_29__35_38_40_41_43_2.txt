S1: In 1909, being homosexual was morally wrong, and people could be prejudiced about something that they did not recognize as innate. There was little historical evidence to prove that people in 1909 believed that it was "right" or "good" to oppress black people or women, and this sentiment extend to homosexuals. In 1909, people knew that gay sex occurred and they understood its occurrence to be entirely behavioral, and therefore, immoral. Homosexuality was not understood as a social identity back then, so there was no "gay lifestyle" to be prejudiced against. Sodomy was criminalized, not being gay.

S2: There was prejudice against gays in 1909 just as there is now. The immorality of homosexuality in 1909 is based on ignorance. As long as gay people "lived straight", they could be as sexually non-normative as they wanted to be. There were terms for gay men back then, like sodomite and molly, so there was a clear identity for people to be prejudiced against. Men who "acted gay" were punished for it in 1909.

Two people are discussing a the perception of homosexuality in 1909.  S1 makes the argument that in 1909, homosexuality was viewed from a moral standpoint instead of being about prejudice and bigotry, since they didn't realize that homosexuality was a state of being and thought it was purely behavioral.  S2 contends that it was once moral to have racial and gender inequality based on prejudice, so prejudice against gays was around even then.  S1 retorts  by stating that there's little historical backing to the idea that racism or misogyny was doing good, and the issue in 1909 was understood behaviorally and therefore morally.  He states that 1909 society had to little understanding of homosexuality to be prejudiced.  To contradict, S2 states that people hatefully used the term "Sodomite" to refer to gays, were put in prison and kept out of everything in Society.  S1 rebuts by stating that it is because Sodomy wasn't approved, not because they were gay, as there was no social identity.

S1 sides with the court's argument that in 1909 there was no prejudice toward gays as they didn't know what this was at that time and this makes it a moral standpoint, not a prejudice against.  S1 feels S2 does not have a firm grasp of historical facts due to the points made.  S1 rejects the point of gays having been forced to conform to society and cites that hetero-society did not believe in sodomy and due to this would not support relationships between two males.

S2 compares the treatment of homosexuals in that era with the oppression of the black race and the belief women were a lesser gender.  S2 believes the morality of the era was based on ignorance and prejudice as it is today. S2 advises the moral system used in that era was prejudice based on ignorance and society is plagued by the same ignorance and non-morals. S2 also believes gays were not thought of as human.  Free to be gay as long as they weren't openly gay.

S1 and S2 are discussing society's attitude toward homosexuality in 1909 in reaction to a court case addressing a 1909 issue.  It is not clear when the opinion was issued, but S2 suggests that the unanimous opinion of 6 judges implies that a ruling in 1909 against homosexuality was not based on prejudice because the act of homosexuality was viewed more as a crime rather than membership in a group.  S1 asserts that there have always been homosexuals and prejudice against them, citing Oscar Wilde for example.  S2 argues that genetic causes were not considered at the time, that homosexuality was deemed misbehavior, and in the past were repressed enough to not constitute a known community which could be discriminated against.  S1 likens historical discrimination against the gay community to historical discrimination against blacks with slavery and women with misogyny.  S2 differentiates the latter two by arguing that nobody openly supported slavery or misogyny as a good and moral thing, whereas the prosecution of sodomy was considered a routine legal proceeding.

S1 believes that in 1909, the stance against homosexuality was based on a moral obligation and not prejudice because homosexuality at that time was viewed as behavioral and not genetic. This person parallels the treatment of women and blacks during that time period and state that it was viewed, back then, as morally right. They argue that since most people viewed homosexuality as a behavior and not a state of being in 1909, it couldn't have been prejudiced. This person does not believe that there was a social identity among homosexuals in 1909 because society viewed it as morally wrong.
S2 argues against the idea that ignorance is a reasonable excuse for prejudice. This person also uses the parallel of treatment of blacks and women, but argues that morality was an excuse to hide the prejudice. They argue that ignorance is what led to a distinct prejudice towards certain lifestyles and people, and argues against the idea that there wasn't a social identity for homosexuals in 1909 when there was obvious disapproval aimed in their direction.
