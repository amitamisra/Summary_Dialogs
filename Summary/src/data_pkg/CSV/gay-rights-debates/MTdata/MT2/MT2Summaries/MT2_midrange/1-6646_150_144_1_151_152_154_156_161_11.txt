S1 claims that AIDS was initially spread in the US primarily be homosexuals and that no one argues with this fact. He believes that the resources spent fighting the disease could have been better spent on other diseases such as cancer if the homosexual minority had not spread AIDS to the heterosexual majority with their promiscuous sexual activity. He clarifies that now that AIDS does exist, he does not advocate ignoring AIDS research.
S2 agrees that AIDS was initially contracted and spread by homosexuals, but claims that its early spread was due to blood transfusions rather than sexual contact. He suggests that S1 believes that homosexuals are less important than heterosexuals based on his comment that other diseases are more important to cure than AIDS.

S1 wants to see an actual argument supporting AIDS was not spread in the United States by homosexuals.  S1 believes had AIDS not spread to the point of becoming and epidemic, the United States' medical research could have been more geared toward curing cancer and other diseases and blames promiscuity.

S2 agrees in the beginning AIDS was spread primarily by gay men but also that blood transfusions played a big part as well an accuses S1 of being in support of Paul Cameron's 1985 statement advising of the extermination of the homosexual community.  Based on S1's argument in regard to medical resources, S2 accuses him/her of implying the lives of gay men and women are worth less than those of  heterosexual

Two people are discussing the spread of AIDS in the US.  S2 agrees that gay people were the first victims of AIDS and the first so spread it, but the blame partly lies with blood transfusions also.  S1 states that allot of medical resources that could be spent curing cancer and other diseases are being wasted because of the promiscuity of the gay community.  S2 refutes this by saying it is a bigoted statement; as it means the lives of gay people are less important.  To contradict, S1 states that the statement means that if the US didn't have this many HIV cases, the medical resources could have been put elsewhere, not that the infected should be forgotten.

S1 believes that AIDS was initially spread among the United States through the homosexual male community and does not see sufficient evidence to refute these claims. They believe that homosexuals are a drain on resources because of this, and places the blame on homosexuals for introducing a new strain of virus that has drawn medical attention away from other pursuits like cancer. 
S2 concedes that the homosexual community was one of the first places AIDS began to be spread through the United States, but also states that a large number of cases were because of blood transfusions. They believe that S1 is bigoted and turns their statement around by pointing out that it seems as if they are making those with AIDS unimportant to cure.

S1 claim that he has been unjustly called a bigot for stating as a fact that AIDs is initially spread in the US primarily by gays. He feels that research to combat AIDs have consumed an inordinate amount of resources that could have been used to curing cancer and other diseases. He asserts that the majority of US population is paying the price for the promiscuity of the gay minority. 
S2 asserts that gays are the first victims of the AIDS epidemic and acknowledges that gays are the first people to spread it. He argues that casting gays as spreaders of AIDs alone drives hate-speech. An example is Paul Cameron's statements that call for the extermination of gays.
