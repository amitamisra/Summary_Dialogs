(S1) begins talking about how we benefit from what is considered common, such as a nuclear family and how it is composed. He also says that it’s right it has nothing to do with the bible however; it has everything to do with slippery slop logical fallacy. Then, gives the example of how incest and polygamy is less socially accepted in comparison to gay marriage. And so, it rebuttals the argument using both issues with equal weight because it scares some people away who might not have much knowledge about the topics.  (S2) states that a married couple is considered a nuclear family and that marriage is a legal institution. (S2) poses the question of weather it’s acceptable for gay marriage to be accepted but not the other because they are less popular and if so why? (S1) answers that those issues do not relate specifically to gay legal marriage and that many attempt to use those issues similarly to argue against gay marriage.  (S2) brings up the question of what is socially accepted and the types of taboo relationship and legality. (S1) says that love is not exceptionally for gay people but also others. Also that taboos are constructed on the basis of peoples reasoning, indications and practices. (S2) keeps arguing why is anestrous taboo and not gay marriage?
