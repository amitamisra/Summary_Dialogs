S1 and S2 are discussing a seemingly pending law that would permit marriage officials to decline to conduct gay marriages if they are opposed to them on religious principals.  S1 finds it acceptable, while S2 complains about it.  S1 proposes that it is easy for S2 to be unsympathetic because S2 dislikes religion.  S1 acknowledges that he considers such religious objections to be evil.  He suggests that because the individual licensed to perform a marriage is paid or licensed by the State, the individual should reflect the will and choices of the State and therefore perform gay marriages despite his or her personal religious objection to them.  S2 suspects that the law may result in an effective denial of gay marriage.

S1 believes that religious freedom allows for people to not do something, such as serve a gay customer, that they find objective to their religion. He gives an example that Jewish people should not be forced to work on the Sabbath or eat pork. Likewise, he thinks Christians should not be required to serve gay people in a way that violates their religious beliefs. S2 believes it should be a requirement that you serve all customers and gives the example that he couldn't refuse to serve a boy scout or Christian that he doesn't agree with. He goes on to say that taxpayers and employers are the ones providing the paycheck, not God. He believes service is a requirement to express the freedom people have.

The issues here appears to stem from an employee citing some religious view to his/her boss indicating why they cannot perform a job duty.

Speaker one doesn't think people should pick and choose what they want equal rights on, in this case between religion and other rights issues, that it should be all or nothing. Speaker one therefore believes that speaker two is unfairly discriminating against an employee based off their religious views.

Speaker two believes that society dictates that you have to be biased at times. Speaker two continues that if speaker one's logic holds true, then he/she should be able to turn away customers based off his/her own personal religious views.

Two people are discussing equality and natural rights.  S1 states that discrimination on people for being religious and keeping people from religion infringes on natural rights, and if you are for equality for gays then you need equality for all.  S2 states that this allows people to do whatever they want and use their religious beliefs as an excuse.  To contradict, S1 states that only serious religious views are taken into account.  S2 then proposes a scenario where the only person available to perform the gay marriage ceremony is exempted based on religious beliefs, their rights won't be upholded.  S1 rebuts by stating that the proposed provision would allow someone else, and this is due to religious freedom.

Two people are discussing gay marriage.  The discussion revolves around whether or not a clergy person should have the right to refuse to marry a gay couple based on religious beliefs.  S1 believes this is alright to do while S2 does not agree.  S2 provides an example of his/her managing a restaurant asking if it would be acceptable for him to refuse to serve a boy scout based on the fact they conflict with his/her religious beliefs.  He/she also believes clergy members should not be permitted to refuse a union due to the fact the tax payers pay the salary of such people.  S1 feels forcing this issue is the equivalent to forcing a Jewish person to eat pork sandwiches.
