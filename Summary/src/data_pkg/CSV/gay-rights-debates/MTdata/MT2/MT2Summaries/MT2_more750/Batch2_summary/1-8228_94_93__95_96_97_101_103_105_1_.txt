This is about the use of arguments of violence towards gay-marriage. S1 starts off saying there is a difference between being anti-gay and someone condoning violence against gay people. S2 talks about how violence is used to make people feel threatened to feel a certain way about a topic or debate. S2 used the example of kids being taught about gay marriage in school as a threat. S2 also mentions someone named Archie who posts include a variety of slurs towards gay people. S1 brushes on the topic, but goes off track from the topic quite a bit. These two people start referring to each others "attacks" on each other towards the end. S1 says they were referring to namecalling and violence from the original post that was opposing gay rights. These two aren't really in opposite positions/beliefs, but they are more trying to discuss the ways they argue for or against gay marriage and how it may be portrayed by others.

S1 thinks violence towards gays is used as launching point for gays to preach gay rights.  S2 makes reference other poster and homophobic slurs that be frequently used on the thread. S2 believes that violence towards gay stem from slanderous representations of gays, and produces a toxic environment where people will act in violence out of fear.  S1 is once again gets angered by the generalizations used by S2, because it does not represent his point.  S2 is happy S1 is no loner attacking him. S1 believes he was only responding to the attacks by S2.  S2 becomes angry with S1 for avoiding the main topic at hand.  The discussion diverges into S2 quoting previous posters and showing hateful speech.  S2 believes this dehumanizing talk in responsible for hate against gays.

(S1) is talking about how gay marriage is not synonymous with violence. (S2) argues that there is regular denigration of gays and mentions politicians unhelpful views on gay marriage. (S1) also says that its funny how violence is used to end an argument against religion. (S2) is talking about bad things that people make/talk about gay people to influence fear on others. For example, that gay marriage means that children will have to know about it, churches to perform gay marriages, and that the adds on Proposition 8 the adds were insightful. (S1) says that there is an anti-gay rhetoric and inflated statements to scare people. Then both (S1) and (S2) argue about how they are not so interested in arguing with each other but they are invested in defending their ideals.

S1 points out that the gay marriage debate is not synonymous with someone condoning violence against gays. S1 thinks that anyone here would with S2 that gays shouldn't experience violence and name-calling. S1 doubts that anyone would be satisfied if every religious person who genuinely disagreed with gay marriage because of their religion added a ' but-no-violence ! ' addendum to everytime they weighed in on it .People shouldn't have to stop standing up for their principles just because of nutcases out there. S1 is not trying to ignore S2 and defends not attacking S2 due to the change of tone of S2. Namecalling and violence are wrong , REGARDLESS of where people fall on the issue of gay marriage . In fact , more importantly , they're always wrong no matter what the issue . 
 
 
 S2 points to another author Archie who regularly denigrates gays with a variety of slurs as someone who uses inflammatory language. There are people  who put out junk that makes people feel threatened by gays . It's built up toxicity from all the anti-gay rhetoric that reaches a boiling point . When the rhetoric inflames , it's obvious where it starts when somebody gets burned. S2 thinks that S1 throws arbitrary arguments out there , belittles the claim of S1 and demonstrates an ulterior motive for ignoring the statement .

S2 says that on Archies post that Archie regularly denigrates gays with a variety of slurs. S1 finds it funny that the whole violence thing gets used as a means-to-an-end tool by those who argue against religious people on this. People shouldnt have to stop standing up for their principles just because of other people. S2 says telling people that gay marriage will makes their kids have to be taught about gay marriage is a threat, as well as telling people that gay marriage will require churches to have to perform gay marriages. S2 thinks S1 is ignoring him but S1 says he is not rather S2s tone has changed. S1 says name calling and violence were the things Jason conflated with opposing gay marriage. S2 asks S1 to quote exactly what he said because he thinks Jason did no such thing.
