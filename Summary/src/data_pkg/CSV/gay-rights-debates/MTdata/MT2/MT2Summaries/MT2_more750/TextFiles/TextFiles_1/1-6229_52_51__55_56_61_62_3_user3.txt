(S1) states how can gay marriage hurt politicians or anyone else? (S2) says that there are laws that hurt all kinds of peoples and argues about violation of the First Amendment by imposing someone’s belief over another. (S1) argues that he is only concern with gay peoples rights and says that the politician wants gays to remain as second-class citizens. Argues that politician/she is discriminating and protecting her heterosexual privilege. He also argues that not accepting gay marriage is punishment to him, his family and others. (S2) He argues about the kind of democracy in where majority of the people decide what best for society and how being anti-gay is a right of the First Amendment.  Is a gay person is allowed to have the freedom, so does he who and others who may not agree. (S1) then gives the example that not just because majority rules it means that it’s a good thing. For example, enslaving people was accepted in previous societies. (S2) argues that although previous societies had legal rights to enslave people but that doesn’t mean that it makes those decisions all the time and that is like gay marriage.
