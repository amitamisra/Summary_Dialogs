S1 does not believe that what Jefferson recommended be done to homosexuals is okay. They point out that according to the Christian faith it is sinful, but not to modern law. They argue that the country is not a theocracy, and allows everyone equal rights to practice their religious beliefs as they see fit, but likewise does not allow for one to exert control over another.
S2 believes Jefferson was correct in stating homosexuality as being a crime. They believe that since they personally think it is a sin, there should be a penalty against homosexuals and those that advocate it. They argue that liberal tolerance assumes a mindset that advocates its own views on conduct at the exclusion and dismissal of those that do not.

S1 claims that Thomas Jefferson did not recommend the negative behaviors that are targeted toward homosexuals, and that although homosexuality is a sin according to Christianity and may have been illegal in the past, it is not anymore. He points out that America is not a theocracy and that Christians are not persecuted, citing the fact that they are free to practice religion as they choose. 
S2 claims that Thomas Jefferson was correct in labeling homosexuality as a sin and a crime. He believes that there should be heavy monetary fines for engaging in or advocating homosexual behavior. He argues that liberal tolerance is just as dogmatic as Christianity, and that it is no more right to base laws on this perspective over any another.

S2 thinks homosexuality is a sin and should be a crime along with heavy fines. S2 believes liberals are hypocritical in talking about tolerance and justice. He thinks liberals think only they are right, push the liberal way as social norm, and ridicule anyone that doesn't agree. S2 points out this isn't a theocracy and that if someone wants to live in a society based on religion there are other places that have that. S2 thinks Christians are hypocrites because they claim to be persecuted because they can't force their religion on others. He says they may practice as they wish, but they can't force others to do so.

S1 believes while homosexuality was considered a crime in earlier times, it is no longer a crime today.  S1 feels S2's argument of liberal persecution can't hold water due to the fact that liberal tolerance is what allows for S2 to worship as he/she chooses and state openly his/her opinions.

S2 believes homosexuality should still be considered a crime and those who participate in it should be punished by law along with those who support them.  S2 also believes liberal tolerance is as a whole, not actually tolerant.  Feeling also people with other views from liberalism are persecuted for non-acceptance publicly.  S1 advises gay marriage was voted on and lost there they live and feels it is mostly based upon religious values.

Two people are discussing laws and politics.  S2 states that homosexual sex is a sin and a crime, and there should be a huge fine on the behavior.  S1 retorts that while Christianity states its a sin, it is not a crime anymore.  He states that the US is not a theocracy, and the freedom available in the US means that the responsibility of appeasing a Christian God cannot be forced on the population.  S2 retorts that liberal tolerance is contradictory, dogmatic, intolerant and coercive as it only allows for one correct view.  To contradict, S1 states that the "liberal" tolerance still allows for the free practice of religion.
