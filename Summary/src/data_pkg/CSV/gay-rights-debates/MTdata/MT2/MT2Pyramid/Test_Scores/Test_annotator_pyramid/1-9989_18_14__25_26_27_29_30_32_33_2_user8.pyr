  <line>S1 and S2 are debating the issue of freedom of speech and gay rights. S1 is against gay rights and believes they earned their freedom of speech through serving in the military. S2 believes everyone has the freedom of speech and is against speaking out towards other kinds of people. S1 is very rude and constantly being immature towards S2. S2 states that we are granted freedom of speech by the constitution, and S1 responds with immature remarks and questions. S2 points out that S1 has no evidence of any sort for his arguments and that believing in the bible should not be a reason to dictate everyone else's rights. Also, S2 adds that he doesn't need to prove his beliefs the same way S1 shouldn't dictate his beliefs. S1 seems to be ignorant to the actual context of the conversation while S2 is in belief that S1 shouldn't use his beliefs to dictate the rights of other individuals.</line>

  <line>S1 and S2 enter a discussion on gay rights and religion impact of legislation. S1 served in the military and they believed they have earned their right to have freedom of speech. S2 points out that gays should be able to do the same but are unable to due to prejudice due to policies that keep gay people from being open about their sexuality. S2 explains to S1 that the right to freedom of speech is guaranteed by the Constitution and gay are not being protected.  S1 is fine with gay serving in the military as long as they stay in closet or they should be kicked out. S2 argues that it is unfair to have laws based on religious text that does serve as everyones religious text.  S1 responds angrily and with homosexual slurs, and requests that S2 take his comments up with Obama. S2 explains his goal is too preach to the public and not to any specific person.  S1 believes S2 is being prejudice against religious-minded people. </line>

  <line>(S1) states that he has served Uncle Sam and fought for his freedom rights. (S2) responds that (S1) does not thinks that gay people should have the opportunity to serve in the military or have freedom of speech. (S2) also stated that (S1) did not fight for his freedom of speech because that right is guaranteed in the constitution. (S1) accuses (S2) about lying about what other have said. He says that gays can serve but they need to stay in the closet. (S2) challenges (S1) to show him where he lied and states that gays can not say whatever they want to because theyll get kicked out and says that is not freedom of speech. (S1) charges (S2) of being in denial but (S2) defends himself by saying that he never said he was in denial and that the religious book is only a philosophical fiction. (S2) says that his fight is not directly or only with (S1) but with others who think that they can tell people how they need to live their lives based on religious beliefs.</line>

  <line>S1 differentiates himself from others around here who live off the service of others by saying that he has served for Uncle Sam and fought for freedom of speech. Sodom and Gomorrah liberals are a scourge to decent people everywhere. Gay people can serve and say whatever they want, but they need to stay in the closet or else they're out of here . There's consequences on earth and in the hereafter for the stiff-necked crowd . S1 believes S2s position is stupid and that S2 is in denial. S1 doesnt believe that a New Testament person , place , or event should be considered to be fiction.S1 thinks that the personal bigotry of S2 is getting the better of S2.</line>
  <line> </line>
  <line> </line>
  <line> S2 finds it amusing that S1 believes that he fought for the right of free speech but that S1 does not believe that gay people should have it. S2 points out that free speech is inherently protected through the constitution. S2 finds that gay people under S1s view do not have freedom of speech because if gay people say the wrong thing then they get kicked out.The constitution applies to all Americans , even the gays . Not everyone believes S1s religious book , and as such , not everyone feels obligated to abide by that book . Thankfully , you and your like-minded crowd of bigots are a dying breed . S2s fight is not against S1 specifically , but against bigots who feel that they can use their personal religious beliefs to dictate what others may or may not do .</line>

  <line>S1 says he served Uncle Sam and fought for his freedom of speech right unlike other people. S2 is amused at S1s statement yet he doesnt feel gays should be able to serve in the military of have freedom of speech. S2 also says S1 didnt actually fight for his freedom of speech but was guaranteed it by the constitution which applies to all Americans including gays. S2 questions S1 to why there should be consequences on earth because S1 believes it is wrong according to his religious book. S2 tells S1 that he has no evidence of what he claims but asks S2 why all Americans should believe S1s book. S2 says the power of the government comes from the people and his fight is again bigots who feels that they can use their personal beliefs to dictate what other may or may not do. S1 questions S2 as to who is he to decide what religious-minded people can and cannot do and says S2s personal bigotry is getting to him. </line>
