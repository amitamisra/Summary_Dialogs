  <line>This is about politics and whether or not the lie in order to get more votes. S1 believes politicians sometimes may lie as long as its what is the majority, while S2 is saying that S2 is more concerned with the honesty of the candidates rather than whether they are lying or not. S2 says we should expect them to be honest, because that is what we should want from politicians. S1 argues that politicians seem to lie in order to get the position they want or sway people to become popular, while S2 thinks that we should rely on them to make the right decision. S1 seems to think that S2 is making an argument for their belief, but S2 is just trying to be honest and show the other perspective. They argue about politicians lying through discussing when politicians are asked questions and how they answer them. S2 finishes by telling S1 we should not label politicians and expect them to do and say the right, honest thing.</line>

  <line>S1 begins the dialog by attacking conservative republicans for the lack of gay rights in America, and claims democrats have been trying to progress gay rights but are afraid to loose their political position. S2 responds by commenting that Democratic Vice President Joe Biden stated he was against gay marriage. S1 believes he was lying to attract votes. S2 expresses desire for a candidate who stands behind their beliefs regardless of popular opinion, and not lie to get votes. S1 calls S2 naive for believing that lying does not happen in politics today. S1 believes it is the responsibility of the public to decipher political language to know when politicians are lying or not.  S2 believes that the public should demand honesty but not assume it.  There is no point is questioning candidates, if it is known they are going to lie. S2 addresses that S1 also believes that honesty should be demanded because their earlier statements insinuated that they thought this practice was wrong</line>

  <line> (S1) argues that overtime-religious politicians, conservative republicans have made the effort to make gay rights a poison topic. According to his democrats want to do the right thing however, they are force to moderate their opinions for public approval. (S2) says that politicians lie about their opinion to not loose votes. He says that he would prefer if politicians were honest. (S1) says that it is common knowledge that politicians are going to lie because they can not simply say things, they have to be careful for the judgment of other. The particular case of Biden who stated that doesnt support gay marriage. He also states that it might be because Biden did not wanted to risk his support and his position in the White House. (S2)  argues that (S1) is misunderstanding him because according to him people need to put expectation for politicians to be more clear and honest about their opinions. He says that people need to pay close attention to politicians and not excuse politicians cynicism so that the American people can have politicians to be honest. </line>

  <line> S1 is of the opinion that a certain level of dishonesty is understandable and expected in politics. In regard to gay rights, the religious right and conservative republicans have made it a poisoned topic such that politicians wont say the right thing because it will cost them votes. Democrats have had to be moderate on the issue in order to still be in a position to do something. Its too naive to expect to a politician to give their view on matters, and so it is necessary to figure out how often they lie, what they lie about, and how big their lies are.  In this particular case , if Biden says he doesn't support gay marriage S1 is just as likely to think it's because he knows that open support could cost him the White House as any other reason .  </line>
  <line> </line>
  <line> </line>
  <line> S2 believes that as political consumers we should expect honesty of the politicians. It isnt too much to demand honesty. Without that expectation it is pointless in asking a politician a direct question. S2 understands that politicians lie but holds that if words of politicians mean nothing then there is little point in having political discourse. Political cynicism is no excuse to not put expectations on our candidates to be honest with the American people .</line>

  <line>S1 says the topic of gay rights has become a poisoned topic because of efforts of religious right and conservative republicans. It will cost more votes than it will gain. S2 questions if S1 is saying the Biden was lying when he said he doesnt support gay marriage so he could keep from losing votes. S2 prefers political candidates to be honest about their views on topics, whether its popular or not. S2 believes a candidates view should be accepted that it is really their view and S1 says that politicians are going to tell some lies and consumers should not take politicians at their word. S1 believes it is important to figure out how often they lie and how big their lies are. He gives an example of how Biden says he doesnt support gay marriage, it can because he knows that open support could cost him the White House. S2 believes they should put the expectation on them to be honest about what their views are and political cynicism is no excuse to not put expectation on their candidates to be honest.</line>
