S2 maintains that the origins of AIDS cannot be determined and that S1 is ignoring the documented rise in AIDS cases amongst straight people, mainly women. Further he believes that disease doesn't discriminate and it doesn't matter how a victim contracts the virus, even if it's through bad choice. Isolating certain groups for blame is scapegoating.

S2 maintains that the origins of AIDS cannot be determined and that S1 is ignoring the documented rise in AIDS cases amongst straight people, mainly women. Further he believes that disease doesn't discriminate and it doesn't matter how a victim contracts the virus, even if it's through bad choice. Isolating certain groups for blame is scapegoating. 
3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3Z3J3VG6NWPUZWGNS4SR3A8UKTLZWB	A1N8BW04V76ZSY	1	S1 blames the spread of AIDS mainly on gay and bisexual males.  For support he cites CDC data which states that the risk of women getting AIDS from heterosexual contact is small, unless drug use is involved. He says when women do get AIDS from sexual contact with men, it's either because those men are bisexual, or are addicts who have shared needles with AIDS carriers. He accuses S2 of not wanting to admit that gays have played a major role in the spread of AIDS.
S2 cites statistics that show the rate of women getting AIDS is on the increase, due to sexual contact with men in general.  S2 does not want to make a distinction between gay, straight, or bisexual men.  He thinks AIDS is AIDS.  All who contract it are victims.  He thinks it's wrong to single out gays as the cause of AIDS spreading.  He says there is no hard data that proves that women having sex with MSM is the main culprit.
3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3XNV0RN8PGSFNTS7QGXBHQ60CIDD45	A3MHPUISLP7CTS	1	S1 is of the opinion that HIV started with, and is predominantly spread by sex between gay, or at the very least bisexual men, and by intravenous drugs users.  Women only contract and spread the disease by having sex with high risk partners, as described above, and that the disease should not be considered a mainstream heterosexual disease.
S2 argues the primary spread of the disease is through unprotected sex in general, not just homosexual male sex, and cites sources that show rates of infection in women have increased greatly in recent years.  It is also said that the virus is spread though all groups of people, and that lifestyle choices (in terms of sexual orientation) are not solely to blame for the rates of infection.  S2 also notes there is a lack of evidence showing the highest risk factor for women exclusively involves them having sex with men who engage in homosexual sex.
3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3DVQVPXMVGUH96XW3ML2F4B919BIK2	A2B2U8VNS9DK94	1	S1 is blaming the spread of HIV on homosexuals and drug users.  He claims the widespread propagation of HIV took place in the gay community, not Straight America, and that transmission to heterosexuals is an adverse effect of that propagation.  He clearly does not like homosexuals and also expresses disdain for bisexuals and a CDC classification of "males having sex with males" which S1 and S2 refer to as MSM.  S2 maintains that S1 is looking to scapegoat the gay community, that the HIV disease is young and that all facts are not yet known.  She offers statistics indicating women constitute one third of new HIV infections and 75% of those are through heterosexual activity.  S1 replies that the original cause of those transmissions is primarily homosexuality.  S2 also notes heterosexuals are also to blame for the spread of HIV for not using condoms, and suggests the HIV propagation in Africa was not primarily in the gay community.  She is compassionate about the victims and critical of S1 for disliking and blaming the gay community.
3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	31UE78WJDSA6VPEVX012K1X9MZS7QO	AQVP5IH2S6WCB	1	S1 states that using a condom and having strictly heterosexual sex is no longer enough protection against the HIV virus. Proclaiming that sexual abstinence is the only way a Woman can be certain she will not sexually contract the HIV virus.  Women have predominantly become infected with the disease from a bisexual Male partner, who in turn, contracted it from partaking in high risk activities. Those activities include: IV drug use or sexual activity with a gay, bisexual or MSM partner.


S2 points out that statistically HIV is still a very “young” disease with much still remaining unknown and so much more to be learned about it. The numbers of infected Women has grown substantially over the years in which the data has been studied; now accounting for one third of the newly diagnosed cases. Admonishing that the main way Female’s contract the HIV virus, is from having Heterosexual sex with Men, those Men who happen to be infected. The gay community isn't opening the “floodgates” of disease because they choose to express their sexuality.

3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	30DEUK80J998QQYAUBCML3UM6LWTNZ	A2OCUOD3G1KKYE	1	S1 believes that HIV was predominately spread through the homosexual community and not "straight America". This writer believes that women get HIV by sleeping with bisexual men or drug addicts. This writer also expresses that HIV can be contracted through prisons by homosexual men.  

S2 states that we do not know where the original leak of HIV started. However, has cited that HIV is more common among women and sites facts listed on several webpages. This writer also does not see any information about women contracting HIV through having relations with bisexual men or a woman partnering with an MSM. This writer also makes a point that this disease is spread regardless of country, or sexuality. 
3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3EKR9ZOLU9GY33R4YAYF95QXB1EMGJ	A344S2FHK3807G	1	S1 does not believe that HIV is a disease that is classified as being distinctly heterosexual. The foundation of the argument is based upon the belief that women only contracted HIV from men who had sexual relations with other infected men. This is based on the belief that HIV was first spread among homosexual communities, and then spread to heterosexual communities through drug use and relations between women and infected men.
S2 attempts to refute this by giving statistical examples and cited sources of women infected with HIV, and points out that none of them concretely confirm that the men these women had sexual relations with had sexual relations with other men who may have been infected. There is an attempt to point out that the exact origin of HIV has never been conclusively discovered, and states that attempts to pin it on the homosexual male community is simply to scapegoat a target group that people don't like. No evidence pins the origin of HIV to women partnering with men who have sex with men.
