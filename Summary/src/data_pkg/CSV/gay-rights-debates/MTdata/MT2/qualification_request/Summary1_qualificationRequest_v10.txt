He states that even if a heterosexual person gets the disease, it's likely from a partner who had homosexual relations. 
S2 maintains that the origins of AIDS cannot be determined and that S1 is ignoring the documented rise in AIDS cases amongst straight people, mainly women. Further he believes that disease doesn't discriminate and it doesn't matter how a victim contracts the virus, even if it's through bad choice. Isolating certain groups for blame is scapegoating. 
3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	31UE78WJDSA6VPEVX012K1X9MZS7QO	AQVP5IH2S6WCB	1	S1 states that using a condom and having strictly heterosexual sex is no longer enough protection against the HIV virus. Proclaiming that sexual abstinence is the only way a Woman can be certain she will not sexually contract the HIV virus.  Women have predominantly become infected with the disease from a bisexual Male partner, who in turn, contracted it from partaking in high risk activities. Those activities include: IV drug use or sexual activity with a gay, bisexual or MSM partner.


S2 points out that statistically HIV is still a very “young” disease with much still remaining unknown and so much more to be learned about it. The numbers of infected Women has grown substantially over the years in which the data has been studied; now accounting for one third of the newly diagnosed cases. Admonishing that the main way Female’s contract the HIV virus, is from having Heterosexual sex with Men, those Men who happen to be infected. The gay community isn't opening the “floodgates” of disease because they choose to express their sexuality.

S2 believes that their is not enough evidence to suggest that this is a fact. S2 brings up that women also contract the disease by having unprotected sex with males. S1 then says that it is predominantly women who have sex with males who have contracted the disease by having sex with other males who were all ready infected with the disease, hence the HIV viruses affects mainly the homosexual community. S2 believes that one particular group of people should not be targeted and that "a victim of a disease is a victim of a disease".

3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3FQ5D3M7DVVI85T8P4Q7F1CA4NES7Z	A21SF3IKIZB0VN	1	S2  argues HIV has become a mainstream disease. It is becoming prevalent in the heterosexual as well as the homosexual community. He points out HIV infection is on the rise among women. Women make up nearly one-third of new HIV infections and sexual contact accounts for 75% of the infections.  HIV is spread by men having sex with women.  Men and women who have sexual relations which result in HIV are responsible for their activity. Also, he points out it makes no difference where the disease started anymore. People must understand is that the virus is spreading among all groups of people and people must take precautions.
S1 argues that HIV is not a mainstream straight people's disease. Woman who contact HIV have sex with bisexual men and heterosexual drug addicts. They also share needles with HIV infected people.  The risk of women getting HIV from heterosexual men who are not drug addicts is small. HIV spread first in the gay community. Straight America acquired the disease later through contact with high risk partners.

S1 cites the CDC statistics for women getting HIV from bisexual males without giving exact numbers or sources. S2 cites specific statistics in relation to HIV statistics in women stating that, "Women make up nearly one-third of new HIV infections and in 1992, women accounted for 13.8% of people living with AIDS; by the end of 2001 that percentage had increased to 21% . 6 Among women , sexual contact accounts for 75% of infections . 7 http://www.cdcnpin.org/scripts/hiv/hiv.asp#women   Percentage with HIV who are women in North America increases from 20% in 2001 to 25% in 2003" and gives links to the sources.

S1 claims that women get HIV from men who have sex with other men.  Therefore, it is not a predominantly heterosexual STD. S2 counters that women make up a quarter of the disease holders in the USA and that heterosexual sex is spreading the disease to an increasing percentage of women. S1 asserts than men who have had sex with men must be involved to first spread the disease. S2 says that is uncertain and that heterosexual sex still has to be involved to spread the disease. S1 repeatedly asserts that gay and bisexual men started the disease and that it spread to straight people through their sexual contact with women and through needle sharing.

3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3CG928VSBROL29D2WG7SVQIDMH3BVD	A14WWG6NKBDWGP	1	S1 believes that AIDS is a direct result of one group of people, gay men, engaging in risky behaviors causing the disease to first spread throughout their community, and then leaking into other communities over time. S1 believes that the HIV infection that leads to AIDS is primarily spread by men who have engaged in sexual activity with other men. S1 also maintains that men who have engaged in sexual acts with other men should be considered "gay". Therefore, S1 believes, essentially, the HIV is primarily spread by gay men.  S1 states that the origin of the spread of AIDS can be traced back to the gay community, since the spread of AIDS throughout the gay community is what caused the epidemic to become widely known
S2 asserts that the infection that causes AIDS is spread in many different ways, including heterosexual encounters. S2 argues that the AIDS epidemic has no single traceable source, and that in Africa the disease first appeared primarily in people who had never engaged in male homosexual behavior or, in the case of female heterosexuals, had not engaged in sexual activity with a man who had engages in sexual activity with another male.

S1 argues that the center for disease control has collected data on this subject and based on their statistics have proven that most women contract HIV from bisexual men that has had sex with male partners prior to having sex with them. S2 is accusing S1 of deflecting the issue and that this data is irrelevant to the topic. S2 goes on to argue that no one has proven that HIV or any other STD can be linked back to the gay community and that HIV is not exclusive to any sexual orientation and the fact that the CDC's data is pure coincidence, another thing worth noting is that S2 thinks that HIV is a relatively new disease that needs time to develop, so any data that is collected on this disease is null and void information.
3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3SJUQ9X0DDB0J5SIVUQ5JS80BVC6T7	A128YBWSIZLBWA	1	S1 argues that while HIV is now linked to people of all sexual orientation, it originated from the gay community. Women in this argument are said to contract HIV by having sex with bisexual men, heterosexual HIV positive drug addicts and sharing needles with HIV positive individuals. However, all these individuals only contracted the disease initially through contact with homosexuals.  He is of the impression that if you trace back to its origin, you will find that HIV came about through men having sex with other men.
S2 debates that the data does not support S1’s argument as the CDC shows that heterosexual women are the highest on the list of infected individuals. He argues that at the end of the day the disease is being spread by men having sex with women, hence it cannot be said to be a homosexual originating disease.  He states that it is not known where HIV originated; therefore S1 cannot blame HIV on men having sex with men.

However, S2 argues that the percentage of women contracting HIV is growing year after year, which must be accounted for in some way. In response, S1 contends that the growth in women infected with HIV is due to their sexual coupling with bisexual men and drug addicted heterosexual men, and thus, the disease cannot be considered a mainstream disease for heterosexual couples. Nevertheless, S2 points out women are still contracting the disease from men, which, means that the disease cannot be limited to just homosexual activity. S1 then contends that the homosexual community was responsible for the disease's prevalence in America; while S2 counters that it's not possible to blame one group.

S2 argues that AIDS is acquired in multiple ways, but feels gay males should not be scapegoats. The spread of AIDS is through sexual activity.

S2 contends that HIV being spread from woman to woman is also a contributing factor to the overall increase in cases of HIV. Furthermore, women having sex with men infected with HIV, who were infected either via sex or through sharing dirty needles with other HIV positive persons, is the initial cause according to S2.

He also states that because of this the propagation HIV is  primarily due to the gay community.
S2 contends that the transmission of HIV spreads among all groups of people, regardless of how they got it.  He refutes the other writers opinion of the origin and spread of HIV, stating that placing blame on the gay community only serves as providing a scapegoat.  He states that women make up nearly one-third of new HIV infections, in which sexual contact accounts for 75% of people.  Even if the male first acquired it from another male, HIV still spreads by men having sex with women.

S2 on the other hand, disputes S1’s case by providing statistical information regarding HIV rates in women, and that the gay community isn’t necessarily to blame. S1 continuously advocates that HIV is a disease begin caused by male on male sexual contact, where as S2 is arguing that the finger can’t be pointed directly there, and that heterosexuals simply want a scapegoat for why, they too, are contracting the disease. Both S1 and S2 are discussing the origin of HIV contraction in women, and who puts them at risk the most. S1 is mostly placing blame upon bisexual males, having male on male sexual intercourse, then having sexual intercourse with a female, while S2 blaming intercourse in general, claiming that no particular type of person puts a female at higher risk for HIV contraction.

He states that HIV is not a mainstream “straight” disease because women mainly contract the disease by having sex with bisexual men or drug users, not heterosexual men. He concedes the disease has spread to the point that even heterosexual sex isn’t safe anymore, but blames the prevalence of the disease in the “straight” community on gay men.
S2 asserts that the percentage of women with HIV is on the rise, with women making up nearly one-third of new HIV infections. He believes it is wrong to put all the blame on gay men for the spread of HIV. He feels this is a scapegoat tactic so that men and women contracting HIV from having relations with each other won’t be held accountable for their own actions. S2 concludes that regardless of where HIV originated, it is not correct to classify it as a “gay community” disease, because it affects everyone equally.

3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3UR9MTUDK63VPHR82QZ9HDMQH7QIVW	A11D1QXK72A111	1	S1 believes that homosexuality is the primary cause of the spread of HIV. While he allows that women are contracting the virus from men, he contends that this is due to bisexual men or the sharing of needles for drug purposes. He argues that how women contract HIV is irrelevant by comparing the situation to a dripping pipe. His analogy explains that one should look at the source of the leak, not the end, with the source being the gay male who originally contracted and then spread the disease.
S2 argues that HIV is being spread through many means and that homosexuality is not to blame for the spread of the virus. He continues to rebut that HIV has been repeatedly proven to be transferred in heterosexual activities and that the initial cause is at that point very removed and irrelevant to the situation. He brings up the case of Africa as an example of the cause being irrelevant since the virus is spread there through heterosexual acts, regardless of the origin of it.

3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3UP7ANWDCMV21195T6JR8YL4KAUU90	AUAN582MLI96N	1	S1 believes women are contracting HIV from having sex with bi-sexual men and heterosexual “junkies” who share needles with HIV infected users.  Widespread propagation of HIV occurred in the gay communities, spreading to the heterosexual communities mainly through bi-sexual sex, and also blood transfusions and sharing needles.  Though he clarifies these are not the exclusive reasons HIV has spread, the origins of women with HIV can be traced back to sex between two men.

S2 Points out women make up nearly one-third of new HIV infections, with sexual contact accounting for 75% of those.  The origin of HIV is not specifically known.  It may have been originally contracted between a man having sex with another man, but that does not exclude the reality of heterosexual sex being a risk. Men and women having heterosexual sex with each other does spread the disease.  The virus spreads across all groups of people, some may have been caused by a bad choice, but it’s not fair to label someone contracting a disease as having made a bad choice.

S1 believes that it is only acquired by women at a higher rate when the have sexual intercourse with bisexual men or share needles with a man who is bisexual. 
S2 Does not believe that men being bisexual has anything to do with the rise of rates of transmission. 
S1 believes that transmission may not have affected women unless they began having sex with bisexual males. 
S2 believes that S1 is using bisexual males as a 'scapegoat', and should not place the blame solely upon them. 
S1 believes that HIV started in the homosexual communities and due to the mixed relations between gay and straight couples that even heterosexual relations are not safe any more unless precaution is taken. 
S2 believes that heterosexual couples should not blame their acquisition of the disease on the actions of others. They should blame themselves for not being responsible sexually.

S2 points out that S1 is looking for a scape goat by blaming the person that gave the girl HIV rather than placing the blame on the girl and the activity which she partook in. Continues to stand by the fact the no one group is to blame but that a victim of a disease is a victim of a disease no matter what background they’re from.
S1 Believes that the source of HIV comes from a man having sex with a man and that women who contract it got it from a man who had sex with a man or who was a drug addict and there was sharing of needles involved. He later states that it does not exclusively come from the gay community but that it predominantly does. Continues to stand by the fact that the so called flood gates opened with the Gay community.

3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3D50OEY82NM4DV8QLEBAZPZUCDAMN1	A3HGDV4DD6G1CL	1	S1 believes that HIV infection in women is predominately caused by engaging in sexual activity with men who’ve had sexual encounters with other men, having sex with straight male drug addicts, and sharing needles with HIV-infected individuals. He states that a large part of the spread of HIV dates back to the gay community. If a male has sex with another male, then he is gay; if a male has sex with a male and female, then he is bisexual and putting women at risk of contracting the disease.
S2 offers a rebuttal by stating that the alarming HIV infection in women can’t be blamed solely on men who have sex with both men and women. He states that HIV is spread by any form of high-risk behavior. The CDC and UNAIDS were two sources to back up this claim; both sources provide statics on HIV infection in women. One group of people should not be blamed for spreading a disease that anyone can acquire by engaging in high-risk activities, no matter their sexual preference.
3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3KF9PE6Q0LGNT6W3250R5YJBXI0XIG	A23M5FJOOKNG58	1	S1 believes that the men who contract HIV are predominantly gay, bisexual or intravenous drug abusers. Subsequently, these men then pass it on to women with whom they have intercourse, which has resulted in the HIV infection rate for women to increase over the past two decades. He also believes that the gay community is responsible for the proliferation of HIV infections.

S2 believes that the data is not so cut-and-dried as to confirm that the gay community is responsible for the proliferation of HIV infections. S2 points to studies that show that men who may have sex with other men is not a confirmation that they actually do, and that there is a greater amount of uncertainty surrounding the increasing number of HIV infections than S1 is willing to admit.

One side believes that it is the fault of homosexual or bisexual males that have contracted the disease from other infected males and then pass it on to women. The other believes that it is not so easy to trace the origin, and place blame on one specific group, namely homosexuals. The center of the debate seems to be whether or not the blame should be placed solely on one group of individuals, homosexuals, even though it is now being spread to women through heterosexual men or bisexual men. Heterosexual men could have contrived it from an infected female who may have contrived it from a bisexual male who may have contrived it from an infected homosexual male who contrived it from another homosexual male, etc. The debate seems to be trying to find the genesis of the masses of infection affecting women. One side is looking to place blame completely on one group or scapegoat, where the other is simply showing that there is reasonable evidence to theorize that there could be many different points of origin for the outbreak of cases affecting women.

S1 also beleives that those who have sex with both men and women are making an openly bad choice in this partnering because they are puting others at a much higher risk.
S2 believes that there is no proof for where HIV originated, and even though it is found amongst those of homosexual orientation there is no reason to single that group out other than a personal dislike for the group.

S2 counters that women make up a quarter of the disease holders in the USA and that heterosexual sex is spreading the disease to an increasing percentage of women. S1 asserts than men who have had sex with men must be involved to first spread the disease. S2 says that is uncertain and that heterosexual sex still has to be involved to spread the disease. S1 repeatedly asserts that gay and bisexual men started the disease and that it spread to straight people through their sexual contact with women and through needle sharing. S2 counters that who started it is not clear and not very relevant, because it is now a problem for many straight people either way. S2 also sees as S1 as blaming gay and bisexual men for HIV.

However, S2 argues that the percentage of women contracting HIV is growing year after year, which must be accounted for in some way. In response, S1 contends that the growth in women infected with HIV is due to their sexual coupling with bisexual men and drug addicted heterosexual men, and thus, the disease cannot be considered a mainstream disease for heterosexual couples. Nevertheless, S2 points out women are still contracting the disease from men, which, means that the disease cannot be limited to just homosexual activity. S1 then contends that the homosexual community was responsible for the disease's prevalence in America; while S2 counters that it's not possible to blame one group. S2 goes on to finish by pointing out that no matter which group, heterosexuals or homosexuals, has more cases of HIV; the disease is still growing, and women having sex with men is the primary causation of HIV for women.

S2 argues that AIDS is acquired in multiple ways, but feels gay males should not be scapegoats. The spread of AIDS is through sexual activity.  S2 feels there is no proof to say that gay males are to blame for the origin of aids.

S2 contends that HIV being spread from woman to woman is also a contributing factor to the overall increase in cases of HIV. Furthermore, women having sex with men infected with HIV, who were infected either via sex or through sharing dirty needles with other HIV positive persons, is the initial cause according to S2.

S2 contends that the transmission of HIV spreads among all groups of people, regardless of how they got it.  He refutes the other writers opinion of the origin and spread of HIV, stating that placing blame on the gay community only serves as providing a scapegoat.  He states that women make up nearly one-third of new HIV infections, in which sexual contact accounts for 75% of people.  Even if the male first acquired it from another male, HIV still spreads by men having sex with women.

S2 on the other hand, disputes S1’s case by providing statistical information regarding HIV rates in women, and that the gay community isn’t necessarily to blame. S1 continuously advocates that HIV is a disease begin caused by male on male sexual contact, where as S2 is arguing that the finger can’t be pointed directly there, and that heterosexuals simply want a scapegoat for why, they too, are contracting the disease. Both S1 and S2 are discussing the origin of HIV contraction in women, and who puts them at risk the most. S1 is mostly placing blame upon bisexual males, having male on male sexual intercourse, then having sexual intercourse with a female, while S2 blaming intercourse in general, claiming that no particular type of person puts a female at higher risk for HIV contraction.

S2 asserts that the percentage of women with HIV is on the rise, with women making up nearly one-third of new HIV infections. He believes it is wrong to put all the blame on gay men for the spread of HIV. He feels this is a scapegoat tactic so that men and women contracting HIV from having relations with each other won’t be held accountable for their own actions. S2 concludes that regardless of where HIV originated, it is not correct to classify it as a “gay community” disease, because it affects everyone equally.

While he allows that women are contracting the virus from men, he contends that this is due to bisexual men or the sharing of needles for drug purposes. He argues that how women contract HIV is irrelevant by comparing the situation to a dripping pipe. His analogy explains that one should look at the source of the leak, not the end, with the source being the gay male who originally contracted and then spread the disease.
S2 argues that HIV is being spread through many means and that homosexuality is not to blame for the spread of the virus. He continues to rebut that HIV has been repeatedly proven to be transferred in heterosexual activities and that the initial cause is at that point very removed and irrelevant to the situation. He brings up the case of Africa as an example of the cause being irrelevant since the virus is spread there through heterosexual acts, regardless of the origin of it.

Widespread propagation of HIV occurred in the gay communities, spreading to the heterosexual communities mainly through bi-sexual sex, and also blood transfusions and sharing needles.  Though he clarifies these are not the exclusive reasons HIV has spread, the origins of women with HIV can be traced back to sex between two men.

S2 Points out women make up nearly one-third of new HIV infections, with sexual contact accounting for 75% of those.  The origin of HIV is not specifically known.  It may have been originally contracted between a man having sex with another man, but that does not exclude the reality of heterosexual sex being a risk. Men and women having heterosexual sex with each other does spread the disease.  The virus spreads across all groups of people, some may have been caused by a bad choice, but it’s not fair to label someone contracting a disease as having made a bad choice.

S2 Does not believe that men being bisexual has anything to do with the rise of rates of transmission. 
S1 believes that transmission may not have affected women unless they began having sex with bisexual males. 
S2 believes that S1 is using bisexual males as a 'scapegoat', and should not place the blame solely upon them. 
S1 believes that HIV started in the homosexual communities and due to the mixed relations between gay and straight couples that even heterosexual relations are not safe any more unless precaution is taken. 
S2 believes that heterosexual couples should not blame their acquisition of the disease on the actions of others. They should blame themselves for not being responsible sexually.

S1 Believes that the source of HIV comes from a man having sex with a man and that women who contract it got it from a man who had sex with a man or who was a drug addict and there was sharing of needles involved.

He states that a large part of the spread of HIV dates back to the gay community. If a male has sex with another male, then he is gay; if a male has sex with a male and female, then he is bisexual and putting women at risk of contracting the disease.
S2 offers a rebuttal by stating that the alarming HIV infection in women can’t be blamed solely on men who have sex with both men and women. He states that HIV is spread by any form of high-risk behavior. The CDC and UNAIDS were two sources to back up this claim; both sources provide statics on HIV infection in women. One group of people should not be blamed for spreading a disease that anyone can acquire by engaging in high-risk activities, no matter their sexual preference.

S2 asserts that the no one really knows the original source of AIDS and that it is unfair to blame one group simply because their sexuality deviates from the norm. Ultimately, the source does not matter, as it does not change the fact that AIDS is a problem for all people.
S1 believes that AIDS is a gay disease that is spread predominantly by men who acquired the disease from having sex with other men. Even though data from the CDC referenced by S2 shows that AIDS is increasingly spread to women by men through sex, AIDS is still a gay disease since the original source of the disease is gay sex in the first place. Anybody who is not heterosexual is gay, including bisexuals and MSMs, are gay. The direct transfer of the disease paints a misleading picture of how AIDS is acquired and spread. To understand accurately, one must find the source. The fact that straight people have and spread AIDS is only a tangential consequence of the root cause, which is the gay community.

S2 feels the spread of the disease cannot be blamed on the HIV positive partner of a man who then transferred the disease to a woman partner because it was the latter couple's choice to not use protection.

He believes S1 is biased about homosexuals spreading HIV since women make up nearly 1/3 of the new HIV infections. His point is that in 1992 when the disease was still new, that women accounted for 13.8% of people living with AIDS, and at the end of 2001 the percentage jumped to 21%, and in 2003 it jumped to 25%.

S2 argues that a disease stays a disease regardless of how one gets infected. Also, S2 believes the widespread popularity of women infected with HIV is not solely due to homosexuality.

S1 also beleives that those who have sex with both men and women are making an openly bad choice in this partnering because they are puting others at a much higher risk.
S2 believes that there is no proof for where HIV originated, and even though it is found amongst those of homosexual orientation there is no reason to single that group out other than a personal dislike for the group.

S1 claims that women get HIV from men who have sex with other men.  Therefore, it is not a predominantly heterosexual STD. S2 counters that women make up a quarter of the disease holders in the USA and that heterosexual sex is spreading the disease to an increasing percentage of women. S1 asserts than men who have had sex with men must be involved to first spread the disease. S2 says that is uncertain and that heterosexual sex still has to be involved to spread the disease. S1 repeatedly asserts that gay and bisexual men started the disease and that it spread to straight people through their sexual contact with women and through needle sharing. S2 counters that who started it is not clear and not very relevant, because it is now a problem for many straight people either way. S2 also sees as S1 as blaming gay and bisexual men for HIV.

He further argues that the gay community is the root cause of the proliferation of HIV when we trace the disease back to its origin.
S2 believes that HIV is a relatively young disease and the cases of women contracting the disease are on the rise regardless of the sexual activities of the man. He states the statistics verifying the increase of women being HIV positive.

However, S2 argues that the percentage of women contracting HIV is growing year after year, which must be accounted for in some way. In response, S1 contends that the growth in women infected with HIV is due to their sexual coupling with bisexual men and drug addicted heterosexual men, and thus, the disease cannot be considered a mainstream disease for heterosexual couples. Nevertheless, S2 points out women are still contracting the disease from men, which, means that the disease cannot be limited to just homosexual activity. S1 then contends that the homosexual community was responsible for the disease's prevalence in America; while S2 counters that it's not possible to blame one group. S2 goes on to finish by pointing out that no matter which group, heterosexuals or homosexuals, has more cases of HIV; the disease is still growing, and women having sex with men is the primary causation of HIV for women.

S2 argues that AIDS is acquired in multiple ways, but feels gay males should not be scapegoats. The spread of AIDS is through sexual activity.  S2 feels there is no proof to say that gay males are to blame for the origin of aids. S2 feels a victim of disease is a victim of disease and that the virus continues to spread through all groups of people.

S2 contends that HIV being spread from woman to woman is also a contributing factor to the overall increase in cases of HIV. Furthermore, women having sex with men infected with HIV, who were infected either via sex or through sharing dirty needles with other HIV positive persons, is the initial cause according to S2.

S2 believes that HIV is still in its early stages, and it's too soon to pass extreme judgement. He believes that the spread of HIV is not the fault of gay/bisexual men and drug addicts, and thinks S1 is letting his personal bias get in the way.

S2 - presents facts showing the number of women with HIV has been increasing since 1992, he states that HIV is being spread by men having sex with women and that there's no data showing these men have defiantly had sexual relations with another man, he states that homosexuality is being used a scapegoat for the spread of HIV to deflect the blame from heterosexuals and there is no evidence to show that women are at a higher risk to contract the disease by having relations with a bi-sexual male

3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3IE00H30VCPSTCFEOMX3U4OOQ9OLIG	A2QZ277816OSEW	1	S1 believes the origin of HIV in America can be traced to gay men, and contends this could have been avoided through abstinence. He states that HIV is not a mainstream “straight” disease because women mainly contract the disease by having sex with bisexual men or drug users, not heterosexual men. He concedes the disease has spread to the point that even heterosexual sex isn’t safe anymore, but blames the prevalence of the disease in the “straight” community on gay men.
S2 asserts that the percentage of women with HIV is on the rise, with women making up nearly one-third of new HIV infections. He believes it is wrong to put all the blame on gay men for the spread of HIV. He feels this is a scapegoat tactic so that men and women contracting HIV from having relations with each other won’t be held accountable for their own actions. S2 concludes that regardless of where HIV originated, it is not correct to classify it as a “gay community” disease, because it affects everyone equally.

3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3UR9MTUDK63VPHR82QZ9HDMQH7QIVW	A11D1QXK72A111	1	S1 believes that homosexuality is the primary cause of the spread of HIV. While he allows that women are contracting the virus from men, he contends that this is due to bisexual men or the sharing of needles for drug purposes. He argues that how women contract HIV is irrelevant by comparing the situation to a dripping pipe. His analogy explains that one should look at the source of the leak, not the end, with the source being the gay male who originally contracted and then spread the disease.
S2 argues that HIV is being spread through many means and that homosexuality is not to blame for the spread of the virus. He continues to rebut that HIV has been repeatedly proven to be transferred in heterosexual activities and that the initial cause is at that point very removed and irrelevant to the situation. He brings up the case of Africa as an example of the cause being irrelevant since the virus is spread there through heterosexual acts, regardless of the origin of it.

3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3UP7ANWDCMV21195T6JR8YL4KAUU90	AUAN582MLI96N	1	S1 believes women are contracting HIV from having sex with bi-sexual men and heterosexual “junkies” who share needles with HIV infected users.  Widespread propagation of HIV occurred in the gay communities, spreading to the heterosexual communities mainly through bi-sexual sex, and also blood transfusions and sharing needles.  Though he clarifies these are not the exclusive reasons HIV has spread, the origins of women with HIV can be traced back to sex between two men.

S2 Points out women make up nearly one-third of new HIV infections, with sexual contact accounting for 75% of those.  The origin of HIV is not specifically known.  It may have been originally contracted between a man having sex with another man, but that does not exclude the reality of heterosexual sex being a risk. Men and women having heterosexual sex with each other does spread the disease.  The virus spreads across all groups of people, some may have been caused by a bad choice, but it’s not fair to label someone contracting a disease as having made a bad choice.

3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	30WBVE8WIXWDNUWGCY5QD605D1LAL3	A3BNSQDJHR0O4A	1	S2 believes that the risk associated with acquiring HIV is higher in women today than it was before. S2 states that women make up 75% of new infections through sexual contact. 
S1 believes that it is only acquired by women at a higher rate when the have sexual intercourse with bisexual men or share needles with a man who is bisexual. 
S2 Does not believe that men being bisexual has anything to do with the rise of rates of transmission. 
S1 believes that transmission may not have affected women unless they began having sex with bisexual males. 
S2 believes that S1 is using bisexual males as a 'scapegoat', and should not place the blame solely upon them. 
S1 believes that HIV started in the homosexual communities and due to the mixed relations between gay and straight couples that even heterosexual relations are not safe any more unless precaution is taken. 
S2 believes that heterosexual couples should not blame their acquisition of the disease on the actions of others. They should blame themselves for not being responsible sexually.
3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	39TUNPQ9RK6WG3A3AV45UVLGKDGXCE	A3HBRC5M94AC8C	1	S2 Contends that it is still a young disease and that women make up nearly one-third of new HIV infections and that it is being spread by men having sex with women. S2 points out that S1 is looking for a scape goat by blaming the person that gave the girl HIV rather than placing the blame on the girl and the activity which she partook in. Continues to stand by the fact the no one group is to blame but that a victim of a disease is a victim of a disease no matter what background they’re from.
S1 Believes that the source of HIV comes from a man having sex with a man and that women who contract it got it from a man who had sex with a man or who was a drug addict and there was sharing of needles involved. He later states that it does not exclusively come from the gay community but that it predominantly does. Continues to stand by the fact that the so called flood gates opened with the Gay community.

3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3D50OEY82NM4DV8QLEBAZPZUCDAMN1	A3HGDV4DD6G1CL	1	S1 believes that HIV infection in women is predominately caused by engaging in sexual activity with men who’ve had sexual encounters with other men, having sex with straight male drug addicts, and sharing needles with HIV-infected individuals. He states that a large part of the spread of HIV dates back to the gay community. If a male has sex with another male, then he is gay; if a male has sex with a male and female, then he is bisexual and putting women at risk of contracting the disease.
S2 offers a rebuttal by stating that the alarming HIV infection in women can’t be blamed solely on men who have sex with both men and women. He states that HIV is spread by any form of high-risk behavior. The CDC and UNAIDS were two sources to back up this claim; both sources provide statics on HIV infection in women. One group of people should not be blamed for spreading a disease that anyone can acquire by engaging in high-risk activities, no matter their sexual preference.
3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3KF9PE6Q0LGNT6W3250R5YJBXI0XIG	A23M5FJOOKNG58	1	S1 believes that the men who contract HIV are predominantly gay, bisexual or intravenous drug abusers. Subsequently, these men then pass it on to women with whom they have intercourse, which has resulted in the HIV infection rate for women to increase over the past two decades. He also believes that the gay community is responsible for the proliferation of HIV infections.

S2 believes that the data is not so cut-and-dried as to confirm that the gay community is responsible for the proliferation of HIV infections. S2 points to studies that show that men who may have sex with other men is not a confirmation that they actually do, and that there is a greater amount of uncertainty surrounding the increasing number of HIV infections than S1 is willing to admit. S2 also advances the notion that S1 may be homophobic.

S2 refutes that women make up one-third of the HIV infections. He states that the percentage of women with AIDS has increased by 5% from 2001 to 2003. S1 then states that the women that have AIDS contracted the virus from by having sex with bisexual men and heterosexual "junkies". He goes on to say that not even heterosexual relations is safe, however, the widespread propagation is due completely to the gay community. S2 disputes that just because one group has more cases of HIV, they are not scapegoats for it. It is a widespread virus that can effect everyone
3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3UK66V1A26ZJRM2P90CKVOC5T9PDOR	A2DNF6PTPW3EFD	1	Basically, the debate is over who is to "blame" for the increases of cases of women infected with HIV. One side believes that it is the fault of homosexual or bisexual males that have contracted the disease from other infected males and then pass it on to women. The other believes that it is not so easy to trace the origin, and place blame on one specific group, namely homosexuals. The center of the debate seems to be whether or not the blame should be placed solely on one group of individuals, homosexuals, even though it is now being spread to women through heterosexual men or bisexual men. Heterosexual men could have contrived it from an infected female who may have contrived it from a bisexual male who may have contrived it from an infected homosexual male who contrived it from another homosexual male, etc. The debate seems to be trying to find the genesis of the masses of infection affecting women. One side is looking to place blame completely on one group or scapegoat, where the other is simply showing that there is reasonable evidence to theorize that there could be many different points of origin for the outbreak of cases affecting women.
3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	32M9VRQPO4AG6UF92JNOY2M5E4L8DJ	A3PZV9M96H4O46	1	S2 believes that AIDS is a mainstream disease of which both heterosexuals and homosexuals are responsible for proliferating, mainly through unprotected sex. He presents as evidence data from the CDC to show that the number of women with the disease is ever-increasing and that the major sources of their acquiring AIDS is through sex with men. S2 asserts that the no one really knows the original source of AIDS and that it is unfair to blame one group simply because their sexuality deviates from the norm. Ultimately, the source does not matter, as it does not change the fact that AIDS is a problem for all people.
S1 believes that AIDS is a gay disease that is spread predominantly by men who acquired the disease from having sex with other men. Even though data from the CDC referenced by S2 shows that AIDS is increasingly spread to women by men through sex, AIDS is still a gay disease since the original source of the disease is gay sex in the first place. Anybody who is not heterosexual is gay, including bisexuals and MSMs, are gay. The direct transfer of the disease paints a misleading picture of how AIDS is acquired and spread. To understand accurately, one must find the source. The fact that straight people have and spread AIDS is only a tangential consequence of the root cause, which is the gay community.

3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3P1ZES0BPCGFWGQSZTBKWKW0NBH0IQ	A3U8JUO838Y1W5	1	S1 believes that HIV and AIDS is in abundance thanks to the Homosexual community, he believes that they open the floodgates to HIV because the CDC showed that it is rare for a woman to contract HIV from a heterosexual male, unless he is a drug addict who contracted the disease from used needles. He believes that the majority of women being infected are from sleeping with bisexual men, who were already infected. Where as S2 believes that woman can spread HIV just as fast as homosexual men. He believes S1 is biased about homosexuals spreading HIV since women make up nearly 1/3 of the new HIV infections. His point is that in 1992 when the disease was still new, that women accounted for 13.8% of people living with AIDS, and at the end of 2001 the percentage jumped to 21%, and in 2003 it jumped to 25%. He believes we can't just blame the gay community but make the women and heterosexual drug addict men accountable for spreading the disease as well.

S1 believes that there is little to no heterosexual transmission to men.  That any "straight" male who gets HIV does so as a result of bisexual activity or IV drug use and not as a result of sexual contact with a woman.  In short that homosexuality is responsible for the spread of HIV.
3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3GHKY50Y3VSPGSLI163R3JUZHOYMQP	A2PJ6UMB60IZPT	1	S1 believes that HIV has been spreading over America as homosexuality has become more common. S1 firmly argues that women who live with the disease are exposed to it in two different ways, through needles when using drugs and through having sexual relations with men who have sexual relations with other men. S1 argues the most common and major way for women to get infected with HIV is through sexual relations with men, believing the risks are a lot higher. 
S2 argues that a disease stays a disease regardless of how one gets infected. Also, S2 believes the widespread popularity of women infected with HIV is not solely due to homosexuality. S2 states that the original leak to this disease is unknown and even compares America to Africa to show how the widespread of HIV cannot be exclusively blamed on homosexuality.

They are targeting gay men as the reason for the disease and feel that gay men have put a lot of straight people and women at risk.

S1 believes that HIV is still a fairly young disease and that the current data isn't entirely credible yet. They cited material that shows women are showing more new infections yearly.

S2 says that HIV contraction for women from hetero males is increasing over time and being spread by heterosexual activity.  It isn’t known in these cases if the infection started from homosexual activity but the disease is now being spread by heterosexual activity.

S1 repeatedly asserts that gay and bisexual men started the disease and that it spread to straight people through their sexual contact with women and through needle sharing. S2 counters that who started it is not clear and not very relevant, because it is now a problem for many straight people either way. S2 also sees as S1 as blaming gay and bisexual men for HIV.

S2 contends that HIV being spread from woman to woman is also a contributing factor to the overall increase in cases of HIV. Furthermore, women having sex with men infected with HIV, who were infected either via sex or through sharing dirty needles with other HIV positive persons, is the initial cause according to S2.

S2 asserts that the percentage of women with HIV is on the rise, with women making up nearly one-third of new HIV infections. He believes it is wrong to put all the blame on gay men for the spread of HIV. He feels this is a scapegoat tactic so that men and women contracting HIV from having relations with each other won’t be held accountable for their own actions. S2 concludes that regardless of where HIV originated, it is not correct to classify it as a “gay community” disease, because it affects everyone equally.

Widespread propagation of HIV occurred in the gay communities, spreading to the heterosexual communities mainly through bi-sexual sex, and also blood transfusions and sharing needles.  Though he clarifies these are not the exclusive reasons HIV has spread, the origins of women with HIV can be traced back to sex between two men.

S2 Points out women make up nearly one-third of new HIV infections, with sexual contact accounting for 75% of those.  The origin of HIV is not specifically known.  It may have been originally contracted between a man having sex with another man, but that does not exclude the reality of heterosexual sex being a risk. Men and women having heterosexual sex with each other does spread the disease.  The virus spreads across all groups of people, some may have been caused by a bad choice, but it’s not fair to label someone contracting a disease as having made a bad choice.

S1 believes that transmission may not have affected women unless they began having sex with bisexual males. 
S2 believes that S1 is using bisexual males as a 'scapegoat', and should not place the blame solely upon them. 
S1 believes that HIV started in the homosexual communities and due to the mixed relations between gay and straight couples that even heterosexual relations are not safe any more unless precaution is taken. 
S2 believes that heterosexual couples should not blame their acquisition of the disease on the actions of others. They should blame themselves for not being responsible sexually.

Continues to stand by the fact the no one group is to blame but that a victim of a disease is a victim of a disease no matter what background they’re from.
S1 Believes that the source of HIV comes from a man having sex with a man and that women who contract it got it from a man who had sex with a man or who was a drug addict and there was sharing of needles involved. He later states that it does not exclusively come from the gay community but that it predominantly does. Continues to stand by the fact that the so called flood gates opened with the Gay community.

He states that a large part of the spread of HIV dates back to the gay community. If a male has sex with another male, then he is gay; if a male has sex with a male and female, then he is bisexual and putting women at risk of contracting the disease.
S2 offers a rebuttal by stating that the alarming HIV infection in women can’t be blamed solely on men who have sex with both men and women. He states that HIV is spread by any form of high-risk behavior. The CDC and UNAIDS were two sources to back up this claim; both sources provide statics on HIV infection in women. One group of people should not be blamed for spreading a disease that anyone can acquire by engaging in high-risk activities, no matter their sexual preference.

Subsequently, these men then pass it on to women with whom they have intercourse, which has resulted in the HIV infection rate for women to increase over the past two decades.

S2 believes that the data is not so cut-and-dried as to confirm that the gay community is responsible for the proliferation of HIV infections. S2 points to studies that show that men who may have sex with other men is not a confirmation that they actually do, and that there is a greater amount of uncertainty surrounding the increasing number of HIV infections than S1 is willing to admit.

One side believes that it is the fault of homosexual or bisexual males that have contracted the disease from other infected males and then pass it on to women. The other believes that it is not so easy to trace the origin, and place blame on one specific group, namely homosexuals. The center of the debate seems to be whether or not the blame should be placed solely on one group of individuals, homosexuals, even though it is now being spread to women through heterosexual men or bisexual men. Heterosexual men could have contrived it from an infected female who may have contrived it from a bisexual male who may have contrived it from an infected homosexual male who contrived it from another homosexual male, etc. The debate seems to be trying to find the genesis of the masses of infection affecting women. One side is looking to place blame completely on one group or scapegoat, where the other is simply showing that there is reasonable evidence to theorize that there could be many different points of origin for the outbreak of cases affecting women.

He presents as evidence data from the CDC to show that the number of women with the disease is ever-increasing and that the major sources of their acquiring AIDS is through sex with men. S2 asserts that the no one really knows the original source of AIDS and that it is unfair to blame one group simply because their sexuality deviates from the norm. Ultimately, the source does not matter, as it does not change the fact that AIDS is a problem for all people.
S1 believes that AIDS is a gay disease that is spread predominantly by men who acquired the disease from having sex with other men. Even though data from the CDC referenced by S2 shows that AIDS is increasingly spread to women by men through sex, AIDS is still a gay disease since the original source of the disease is gay sex in the first place. Anybody who is not heterosexual is gay, including bisexuals and MSMs, are gay. The direct transfer of the disease paints a misleading picture of how AIDS is acquired and spread. To understand accurately, one must find the source. The fact that straight people have and spread AIDS is only a tangential consequence of the root cause, which is the gay community.

He believes that the majority of women being infected are from sleeping with bisexual men, who were already infected. Where as S2 believes that woman can spread HIV just as fast as homosexual men. He believes S1 is biased about homosexuals spreading HIV since women make up nearly 1/3 of the new HIV infections. His point is that in 1992 when the disease was still new, that women accounted for 13.8% of people living with AIDS, and at the end of 2001 the percentage jumped to 21%, and in 2003 it jumped to 25%. He believes we can't just blame the gay community but make the women and heterosexual drug addict men accountable for spreading the disease as well.

S2 argues that a disease stays a disease regardless of how one gets infected. Also, S2 believes the widespread popularity of women infected with HIV is not solely due to homosexuality.

While he doesn’t dispute that the virus can also be contracted by sharing needles with an infected party, he appears to hype the brunt of the "blame" unfairly onto the gay community.
S2, while he agrees with S1 on the fact that HIV/AIDS is an awful issue which requires attention, he refutes a great deal of S1's somewhat one-sided, straight forward argument regarding the cause being homosexuality.
