And agrees with S2 that all the bisexuals and MSM's out there have spread the disease to women.
S2 believes that it is spread just as much by men sleeping with women as it is by men sleeping with men because statics show that 75% of women who contract the disease get it from sexual activity. And that if maybe more people started using condoms then maybe they would not get Aids/HIV in the first place. S2 states that there is no known source of where HIV began but when you choose to participate in risky behaviors with out protection you're putting yourself at risk for HIV. And a victim of a disease is a victim of disease, and its a virus that continues to spread among all groups of people.

3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	37TJTI7RUC6ILH7FUHVX7KRYWWUHNH	A34WFUN8O86G6D	1	S1 questions the distinction between MSM and “gay” whilst advocating for abstinence. He argues that the majority of women who contract the virus have not done so from heterosexual men and that it is not a “straight disease.” He believes the “widespread propagation of HIV” occurred within the gay community and that “straight America” was only affected tangentially after their “floodgates opened.”

S2 presents multiple statistics with sources showing the increasing rate and ratio of women living with HIV, contending that it is not just a MSM disease. S2 reiterates that the majority of new infections in women are through sexual contact, and suggests these are primarily from sex with men. S2 indicates S1’s mode of thinking and blaming is a tactic to scapegoat others for whom S1 has a prejudice against and to avoid the personal blame of forfeiting the use protection during intercourse.

3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3KW5TAHNGN9GGUCZRDH9GJXQLEGTHU	A1YZ4GLBIINBW4	1	S1 believes males having sex with males are gay or at least not heterosexuals. The CDC states women getting HiV from hetero males is small; it's not a mainstream"straight' disease.  The origin of the disease is the male gay community.
S2 contends HIV is still changing.  Sexual contact accounts for 75% of infections in women.It's being spread by men having sex with women, regardless of where the man contracted it.  It's a virus that continues to spread among all groups of people.
3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3PFVAQHPP2AFT5YAO6YSQM616VQW9X	A2TR1A3975O3OE	1	The two speakers are discussing a gay rights issue, specifically which groups of people and what methods of transmission are responsible for the spread of HIV, especially the increase of HIV in women.

S1 believes the origin of HIV’s spread to women has been caused by women having sex with bisexual men who first contracted HIV by having sex with another man. S1 also claims it has been spread by women having sex with heterosexual junkies with HIV or by sharing needles with HIV infected people. Basically, he blames the male gay community for initially spreading HIV and that “straight” Americans later contracted HIV from blood transfusions or needles or from sex with high risk partners such as drug users and gay men.
  
S2 disagrees that men having sex with men is the primary cause of HIV transmission. S2 believes that the primary increase of HIV in women comes from women having sex with men who are already infected or with men with unspecified risks. S2 allows that the virus is continuing to spread among many groups and resists blaming it on gay men.

It's still being spread by men having sex with women, and questions if S1 can read. The two parties involved are not to blame for not knowing whether they had the disease or not. 
S1 elaborates that the spreading of HIV only happens in prisons and that the risk for heterosexual males is very small occording to a CDC statistical study. Also is stating that the origin of HIV is from the gay community, but spreads through bisexual men or drug addicts, infecting the women. Then by infecting the women, it can now pierce the straight community, but retracts the statement. Disputes that one group made a bad choice by having sexual contact oppose to the other because of the disease.
