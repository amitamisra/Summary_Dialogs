It's still being spread by men having sex with women, and questions if S1 can read. The two parties involved are not to blame for not knowing whether they had the disease or not. 
S1 elaborates that the spreading of HIV only happens in prisons and that the risk for heterosexual males is very small occording to a CDC statistical study. Also is stating that the origin of HIV is from the gay community, but spreads through bisexual men or drug addicts, infecting the women. Then by infecting the women, it can now pierce the straight community, but retracts the statement. Disputes that one group made a bad choice by having sexual contact oppose to the other because of the disease.
3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	33H80XLTICSYDK7OMC39HM7D02TTWU	A20MFK8S7Y3LM9	1	S1 is arguing that that HIV in America has originated primarily in the gay community. HIV has a more significant presence in a community of males who have sex with males, with a higher rate of infection in this demographic. This is backed by arguing that MSM relations hold the highest risk of HIV contraction. Homosexual and bisexual sex found in gay communities hold responsibility for the spread of HIV. Therefore, abstaining from male sex with men is the safest method of decreasing risk of HIV contraction.
S2 argues that HIV is not a disease inherent to the gay community; one group does not hold sole responsibility for HIV's presence. The speaker refutes anti-homosexual or anti-bisexual by presenting facts on the significant HIV presence among females who have sex with males. These are heterosexual relations, yet still lead to the contracting of HIV. HIV is still fairly new in America, no blame should be put on any group, and the disease should be treated simply as a disease, with no attribution to one particular demographic.

3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3RD245HN5HI1SZGJK89COD3H5PIM0K	A25ROS9CH7PSFZ	1	S1 asserts that women only get HIV from men who are gay or intravenous drug users. He says that men who get HIV from having sex with other men are gay or at least bisexual. He says women are not a risk from heterosexual, non-intravenous drug users. He blames the gay community for the spread of HIV.
S2 asserts that it doesn't matter if women contract HIV from men who have sex with men. HIV is being spread by men having sex with women. S2 cites statistics that show women make up 25% of HIV cases in 2003 and that 75% of these infections are attributed to sexual contact. S2 says it's pointless to attribute the spread of HIV to homosexual men--that it's a virus that affects all groups. 
3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	382D48J8BB95I1MTQK20XKOISNVC49	A3OV6R4YMKIAAM	1	S1 believes that spread of HIV can be attributed primarily to the interactions between homosexual and bisexual males. Though heterosexual activities also spread the virus, S1 argues that a man who spreads the virus to a woman was most likely infected through sex with another male. S2 believes that the spread of HIV cannot be attributed to one group or gender or mode of infection. Even if a male, who had been infected with HIV by another man, infected a woman, she still plays a role in the spread of the virus. S2 argues that the focus should be placed on the fact that the virus is being spread and not on targeting the group that is “responsible” for it.
3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3JZTEPA2N030IWUW74YLH41UEUBEZG	A357X6NIBOTHH0	1	S1 believes that the majority or more of women contract HIV from men who obtained the disease in a couple of different ways. The men in question have either been involved with men sexually or obtained the disease by sharing needles with addicts which were tainted with the disease. S1 also believes "propagation" of HIV was through the gay community in America and believes this to be the original origin of the disease.
S2 argues just the opposite- that women who acquire HIV do so equally from both heterosexual and homosexual men. and states that the victim of a disease is just that; no more and no less. Contrary to the beliefs of S1, S2 contends that the origin of HIV cannot be so easily traced. S2 implies that S1 is simply looking for a scapegoat to back his arguments.
3VIW7BLKQEPL6MLJCV0GKC6OI7G7PZ	3LODA57B7770NJY1V8ZKJY2E6T06BG	A1TIV52E0VUF9Y	1	S1 believes that HIV is primarily a disease spread by gay or bisexual men. Other members of the population have received the disease tangentially. Women with HIV are getting it from having sex with bisexual men who contracted it from male partners. A small exception to this would be heterosexual men who are drug users, having contracted HIV through the sharing of needles. He suggests the problem needs to be cut off at the source, with the abstention of sex by gay and bisexual men.
S2 points out that women with HIV are a growing percentage of the population living with the disease. He believes that gay and bisexual men are not to blame for the actions of expressing their sexuality. If a man and a woman have sex and one were to contract HIV from the other, it is their responsibility, not earlier sexual partners. He sees the blame of the spread of HIV as attributed to gay men are a form of scapegoating, as the original source of the disease is still unknown.
