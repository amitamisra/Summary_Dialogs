He argues that the majority of women who contract the virus have not done so from heterosexual men and that it is not a “straight disease.” He believes the “widespread propagation of HIV” occurred within the gay community and that “straight America” was only affected tangentially after their “floodgates opened.”

S2 presents multiple statistics with sources showing the increasing rate and ratio of women living with HIV, contending that it is not just a MSM disease. S2 reiterates that the majority of new infections in women are through sexual contact, and suggests these are primarily from sex with men. S2 indicates S1’s mode of thinking and blaming is a tactic to scapegoat others for whom S1 has a prejudice against and to avoid the personal blame of forfeiting the use protection during intercourse.
