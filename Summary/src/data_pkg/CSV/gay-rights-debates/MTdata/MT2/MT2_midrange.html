You don't know what questions they asked , or what they screening process was , or anything . You're just making up objections , and deciding without any factual evidence that they apply . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes , that's the point . I'd prefer to know the specifics . Questioning a study is a VERY appropriate thing to do in any study , particularly if it's used to vilify a group of people .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So then question , don't just state that the study has a problem . And " vilify " ? Good grief ! Where did you get that from ? You seem to be taking this a bit too much to heart . A study was done , and done well from all evidence that I've seen , and the results reported . No one is vilifying anyone . If you can show an actuall problem with the study , and not something hypothetical that you came up with , than please do so . It seems quite professionally done to me , but you go ahead and dig all you want . But if you're simply uncomfortable with the results , well , that ' s no reason to go around saying that people aren't doing their jobs or are out to vilify others . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Er . . . that's why I pointed out the specific things I saw as a problem . Are you in a bit of a reactionary mood today ? Yeah , because in my experience in these forums , here and elsewhere , an enormous amount of attention is given to trying to make Christianity look bad , through generalizations , citing irrelevant studies , and misrepresentations . See , the divorce rate of Christians has NO bearing whatsoever on the gay marriage amendment . Or did you forget that ?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No more than usual . :) You , however , are stating that some is a problem , as opposed to possibly a problem . As if you wanted to simply dismiss the results , rather than actually check their validity . That's pretty reactionary . As long as people say that they're trying to protect the " sanctity " of marriage by keeping gays out it's extremely relevant , or at least a very good refutation . <br> <br><b>Key</b> 1-9989_63_61__65_74_75_78_4 <br><b>Dialogtext</b> <br><b>S1:1-  </b>reading some of these posts , its absolutely sickening to see such bigotry .

Why should I throw the Word of God in the trash for your political correctness ? I discarded that decades ago when I found the truth . Why don't you guys read the Bible , pray for deliverance , and get yourselves saved so you will know right from wrong and so you can go to heaven when you die ? I'm going to advise active gays to repent and receive Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior for the remission of their sins . They do that they can be happy for all eternity . You tell them their sin is ok and then they drop down into the Pit of Hell when they die and then they're miserable forever . So who's really looking out for their best interests ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>you disgarded ... political correctness ? ok ... i already know right from wrong . i figured it out myself by treating people with kindness and respect . do you honestly need to refer to a book in order to know what right is from wrong ( albeit a very nasty and malign book ) ? and if youre going to advise gays ( God help us ) , so will i . to all gays : being gay is a sin in the bible's terms , the same bible that says to stone children to death if they misbehave . so that leaves the bible out of a resource we can trust , just be the way you are and youll be happy enough . looking out for their best intersts ...... youre insulting them more like it .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Does that get them to heaven when they die ? You can be a believer in Jesus Christ and do the same thing but rescue people from an eternity of suffering . I'll let Thomas Jefferson answer you on that : " A more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have never seen ; it is a document in proof that I am a real Christian , that is to say , a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus " By the way , which doctrine of Jesus is " nasty " ? Got a scripture # on that ? Show me that in the New Testament , under the New Covenant ? Have you ever read the entire Bible ? They wind up in Hell your way . With friends like that who needs enemies ? I'd rather twinge their consciences and save their eternal souls . <br> <br><b>Key</b> 1-9745_48_46__49_50_53_54_55_1 <br><b>Dialogtext</b> <br><b>S1:1-  </b>.... and certainly what Jefferson was recommending be done to homosexuals is not OK .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>But he was right about homosexual sex being a sin / crime . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>According to your faith it is a sin . According the laws at the time it may have been a crime . Its not anymore .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It is in my mind . There ought to be a stiff-wallet clearing fine on the behavior , and on those who advocate it . It's a perversion of nature and a sin against God . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So ? You don't live in a theocracy , sunshine . If you don't like the freedom that exists here ( which includes your freedom to practice your intolerant version of your faith ) there are other places you can go live . You do not get to force the responsibility of appeasing your God on the population as a whole . No worries , I am sure you will go to heaven anyway .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Along with the failed liberal concept of equality is the mantra of liberal    tolerance .    However , liberal tolerance is not what it appears to be . It is a contradictory , partisan philosophical perspective with its own rigid set of dogmas . It assumes , for instance , a relativistic view of moral and religious knowledge . This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality , abortion rights , and religious truth claims , leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs . But this posture is often dogmatic , intolerant , and coercive , for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues , and if one does not embrace it , one may likely face public ridicule , demagogic tactics , and perhaps even legal reprisals . Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant . That's you , Jito-baby . We voted against illicit gay sex marriage where I live and we won . Eat your heart out , O ye who call good evil , and evil , good . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I know . Its so so so sad how your Christians are so so so persecuted every time you can't make all of us follow the rules of your chosen religion . How do you manage ? I mean , it would be different if all those " liberal " laws and all that " liberal " tolerance would at least allow you to practice your religion as you see fit ..... a wait , um , they do .... Whatever o ye who speaks with his rectum and defecates with his mouth . <br> <br><b>Key</b> 1-9331_3_2__4_6_7_9_1 <br><b>Dialogtext</b> <br><b>S1:1-  </b>All the proponents of Prop 8 need to do is verify that the State Constitutional Amendment banning gay marriage was enacted legally . PERIOD !!!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Do you not understand what is currently going on ? The ruling on whether the California state constitutional amendment was enacted " legally " was ruled on by the courts . What is discussed above is entirely separate . To say something brief to get you up to speed , our state constitution CANNOT violate the federal constitution . So if Prop 8 violates the 14th amendment , then Prop 8 loses . Whether or not Prop 8 violates the 14th amendment is the question that is currently being examined . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>If DOMA isn't declared unconstitutional , then those arguing against Prop 8 are micturating into the wind .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Oh dear God your ignorance is abundant ! Do you not understand what the federal DOMA law does ? Defense of Marriage Act - Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia This very discussion could very well lead to the recognition that the federal DOMA itself is unconstitutional . And as for the state DOMA , this discussion is EXPLICITLY saying that it violates the federal constitution . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It has a financial impact on ALL taxpayers . To say that it has no impact on anyone else is disengenuous . Wow ! You can read Wiki's pseudo-knowledge . I'm impressed ! Now , tell me how the court can rule a California Constitutional Amendment to be unconstitutional before it strikes down the Federal Law that gives states the FEDERAL right to ignore other state's gay marriages .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Actually , such an " impact " is obviously to be disregarded for a very basic and obvious reason . Gays pay taxes just like straight people . So why should gays have to pay for straight relationship marriages , why our own gay relationships are precluded . To try to bring up the impact " on ALL taxpayers " , without recognizing that gays ALREADY PAY for straight marriages ourselves , is rather disingenuous . Actually , I was just trying to dumb it down for you ... Yeah . I knew you were going to fail miserably there ... LOOK at the DOMA ruling . Does it say ANYTHING that actually prohibits a state from ruling that THAT STATE has to recognize gay marriage with respect to the 14th amendment ? No . If you had bothered to read and THINK about what I was showing you , you would realize that the conundrum you THINK exists doesn't actually exist . There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in federal DOMA which prevents a California court from ruling that the 14th amendment requires gay marriage . Furthermore , if you actually THOUGHT it did , something fundamentally wrong should strike you ... The legislature SHOULD NEVER presume to restrict a court's ruling on constitutional interpretation based on a simple law . <br> <br><b>Key</b> 1-9331_28_26__31_38_39_40_3 <br><b>Dialogtext</b> <br><b>S1:1-  </b>Same sex marriage ( whether it negatively impacts typical marriages or not ) isnot the same essential component to the basic structure of our " general " welfare that one man one woman marriage is . Sorry , but it just isn't .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yes it is . Gay couples and families have the same needs , responsibilities to one another and society , as well , despite your desire to marginalize and exclude . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You are being a bit pretentious here ; in that you don't know anything about my desires . More to the point , you ignored what I had actually said and instead responded to what you " assumed " I ment . QUOTE ; " Same sex marriage ( whether it negatively impacts typical marriages or not ) is not the same essential component to the basic structure of our " general " welfare that one man one woman marriage is . " Our society can survive without homosexual unions , polygamy , beastiality etc. I doubt very much our society would survive very long at all without heterosexual marriage . Making sense yet ?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I know what you meant . Marriage is straight , gays are excluded . It's made up of the same components . Only the sexes of the partners is different . No . Our society could survive without allowing many minorities the same rights as the majority . That's not an argument . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Gay ,.. . do you agree that ( we the people ) through government have the right to draw the line ' somewhere ' between what we will and what we will not recognize as ' marriage ? ' ( again , think incest , polygamy , statutory , etc. ) If You do agree that the government has the right to draw the lines somewhere .... then all we have is a disagreement on where the lines should be drawn . There's no need to make it more than what it is .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well , no , I don't think I was making it more than it is . You said society could go on without gay marriage . The only reason for that I can figure , is that gays are a minority . Red herrings such as the laundry list you trot out , aren't an argument in support of the issue at hand , which is banning gay marriage . You're going to have to come up with another argument . Yes , we do have a disagreement where the lines should be drawn . Now , please make your argument for drawing them in such a way that precludes same-sex marriage .

But however much I disagree with Sullivan on many political issues , he's right about that . The world did change when the Mass . legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights . It may be a big change in a small state , but it is a recognition that the winds of change are blowing against homophobic bigotry . You are just going to have to get over it . The world just isn't as anti-gay as it used to be . And that means that you are going to have to accept equal rights eventually , as gay marriage . Presumably you will hope than in a few years , bigots in Massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality . I think you'll be out of luck .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You wish that I wish . Do you just like to argue for the sake of being argumentative ? You've picked out the one single thing I said there that you could disagree with and are making an issue of it , not even willing to agree on anything else I said . But fine , go ahead and think this is some world-changing event if it makes you feel better . Well , clearly you didn't even read my post . ( shrug ) <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You have often posted here that you oppose gay marriage . That means you oppose equal rights for gays . If you have changed your mind , and hope that Massachusetts doesn't overturn gay marriage , you would have said so . Since you didn't , you don't .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No , you said you I " will hope than in a few years , bigots in Massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality " . I had said , very plainly , that I think such legislation is an over-intrusion by the government . Clearly you didn't read my post . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Are you claiming now you are in favour of legal marriage for gays in Massachusetts now the legislature has voted for it ? Because if so , that would be a change .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I'm saying that I would not want an amendment put in place banning it , because that would be an over-intrusion into peoples ' lives by the government . So naturally , I wouldn't want such an amendment voted into creation , either , and that's why I took issue with your claim that I would . That's been my position here for as long as I remember . And it's a true conservative position ( as opposed to neocon ) , BTW . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Are you saying that you are not in favour of a government ban on gay marriage ? You oppose DOMA laws ?

It is our lives that are on the ballot and our rights that our being denied that is who we are . We are the ones who are being told we are second calss citizens .

Of course being a heterosexual you would not understand . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I suggest you get a majority of people and change the law then . This is what happened during slavery ... they actually passed 3 amendments about it . The courts aren't the all knowing group of people that have enlightened minds about what is or isn't fair . Your whole case is based on saying the majority is always be ignored if someone objects to them . I am in the minority when it comes to abortion ... does this mean the court should listen to me and declare abortion illegal ?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No because abortion does not effect your life personally . That iis waht we mean the courts should look at the INDIVIDUIALS life and decide upon that . If a law that the majority favors is unjust in an individuials life then it must be over ruled for the individuials sake . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>What ? That makes no sense . If a law is unjust to one person then it needs to be overruled ? Of course unjustice is defined by the person in question . You make no sense here . You still fail to understand how our courts work too . You want them to work a certain way as opposed to the way they were created under our constitution .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You want a society that oppresses people . If the law effects even one person adversly then it is unjust and needs to be overturned . IT only goes to prove that conservatives are heartless and want people to suffer . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I want a society that is free to make laws and rules as it sees fit .

I'm not saying businesses can't legally do it -- they can -- I'm saying I think it's pretty unethical . It's easy for you to sit back and say what you're saying when you dislike religion , but this is no different than an employer telling a gay employee they can't express themselves as being gay on the job . One is discrimination for being gay , the other is discrimination for being religious . If you're going to be for equality , then be for equality in all cases . Not just picking and choosing your pet issues .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Once again jyoshu ; I manage a fast food resturant . Do you agree that I do not have to serve boy scouts and evangelical christains ? My moral beliefs are against them I should have the right to turn away their business . After all they go against my religious beliefs so I can refuse to serve , or even hire them . Right ? If I use your logic I should beable to do whatever I want and use my religious beliefs as an excuse . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Mistaken notion ? She said clearly " I've worked on plenty of legislation . . . We enact the will of the people " It sounds to me like she's a legislator . That's certainly the way it comes across -- how could you possibly take that any other way ? A better analogy would be if you were trying to force a Jewish employee , whom you KNEW was Jewish , to work on his sabbath rather than being willing to work with him about that . Or to suddenly tell him he has to eat a pork sandwich or something . And remember , this is a different issue than benignly serving food . We're talking about a major religious issue here -- gay marriage , to religious people , is like asking them to approve most any bad thing in society you can think of . You have to take the seriousness of the religious view into account here somewhat .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Why ? It is not my problem they have evil religious values . Do they work for the state or God ? Does God pay their paychecks or do the taxpayers ? They just have to sign a civil contract . So what if that person is the only person able to do marriage contracts in the area . How does the state ensure that gay people can exersize their right to marriage if the only person able to perform the marriage is exempted from perfoming the marriage based upon religious beliefs ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I just think you are viewing this the wrong way -- making it more complicated than it is . It is simply a provision that allows a person to let someone else conduct the civil ceremony if their religious beliefs don't allow them to do it . The same idea that would allow a Jewish person to pass on eating pork if it were suddenly expected for him or her to do it when it wasn't before . That's all this is -- let's not make mountains out of molehills ...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yet what if there is no one else in the community ? How is the government going to ensure gay people are able to exersize their rights ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well , then I guess they need to ensure someone is there that WILL do it as well . Gee , that darn religious freedom -- messing everything up , huh ? <br> <br><b>Key</b> 1-7858_135_133__137_142_144_148_1 <br><b>Dialogtext</b> <br><b>S1:1-  </b>Since the " traditional definition " of marriage is a human-made construct , humans can change it to meet changing times . Case in point , the " traditional definition " of marriage according to Blackwell's Commentaries on the Common Law meant the disappearance of the identity of the woman into the identity of the man .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The legal definition is a human-made construct and as such can change . But given it is a human-made construct and we live in a democracy , the way it would change is via a vote . In 26 states so far the definition of marriage remains one man and one woman . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not so . Fundamental rights are not subject to plebescites . See Loving v . Virginia for a fuller exegesis .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This seems so absolute for someone that believes in an " evolving " constitution . Perhaps we evolved out of the Loving decision which was incorrect in reasoning . Even if a right is in the constitution , it is still subject to a vote ... just takes a bigger one to amount of votes . Finally , what does marriage being a " fundamental right " have to do with anything if the question is defining marriage ? You said it was subject to change ... so how does it change if not by vote ? By your opinion ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>"    ... the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature , in order , among other things , to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority .    Alexander Hamilton Once again , if you have a problem with this , take it up with the Framers , not with me . Anyone defending the principle that same-gender marriage can be banned by state action must first show as a condition precedent that marriage is not a fundamental right or , in the alternative that there is a COMPELLING REASON to ban the practice . Even for this rogue Court , that's a high burden to meet .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I don't have a problem with it but it seems you do . What I do have a problem with is the courts deciding legislative items . You propose the judiciary become the legislative branch . On the contrary . You must show why it isn't a state power to do so . Also , you didn't answer any of my questions . For someone that believes in an evolving constitution why can't it evolve away from the Loving decision ? <br> <br><b>Key</b> 1-6124_36_32__38_42_51_55_1 <br><b>Dialogtext</b> <br><b>S1:1-  </b>Certainly not yours . You should know that I am for no marriage in government . It should be left to a religious institution where it will actually mean something . The states should then go back to doing something that actually makes sense and doesn't reward people like Britney Spears for being white trash .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That is all well and good , but it is not the religious ceremony and sanction that gays are looking for . They already have that ; there are churches that perform same-sex marriages . It is the civil benefits that are at issue . Are you saying you would be in favor of foregoing ALL the legal rights and benefits you are afforded by marriage ? For example : * Assumption of Spouse    s Pension * Automatic Inheritance * Automatic Housing Lease Transfer * Bereavement Leave * Burial Determination * Child Custody * Crime Victim    s Recovery Benefits * Divorce Protections * Domestic Violence Protection * Exemption from Property Tax on Partner    s Death * Immunity from Testifying Against Spouse * Insurance Breaks * Joint Adoption and Foster Care * Joint Bankruptcy * Joint Parenting ( Insurance Coverage , School Records ) * Medical Decisions on Behalf of Partner * Certain Property Rights * Reduced Rate Memberships * Sick Leave to Care for Partner * Visitation of Partner    s Children * Visitation of Partner in Hospital or Prison * Wrongful Death ( Loss of Consort ) Benefits What do you say ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>yeah I know . I'm saying that there should be a better system . For example , if you had a best friend who you are roommates with ... both hetero for the sake of argument ... and never wish to get married then could they get some of the benefits you described ? My Uncle actually was single until he died but he had a female friend who he was best friends with ... why couldn't they get some kind of benefits if they so choose ? Hospital vistiation rights and things of that nature are obviously the most important in this kinda situation . It just seems the single folks are the ones getting screwed over in the marriage deal :)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But gay folks are not ? To the single folks , I say get married . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Ok , lets use that logic .... To the gay folks I say marry a woman . Bet you aren't happy with that :)<br><b> S2:3-  </b>If you want the benefits of marriage , get married . But you ought to be able to marry a person of your choice . Your suggestion would be to marry someone I don't want to me married to , that is a different thing . It is not using " that logic " . I thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you . Isn't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities ? I am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly . I happen to think that's a bad idea . People get married for many reasons , some of which I would feel are not good reasons , but I would not make it illegal to do so .

I'd say that bunch of people is about a hundred times greater than the little bunch that wants to destroy that idea .

It is an obvious attempt to deflect the focus away from the first statement , is it not ? It's not my logic that you're trying to refute , you're trying to deflect the topic away from how AIDS spread in the US . If you want to refute my statement , show me some FACTS , not wishes , opinions , feelings , or other means of subterfuge . I'll say it again for you . AIDS reached critical mass and became an epidemic in the US primarily via the gay community . If you don't agree , show proof to support the contrary . It shouldn't be that difficult . If I'm nothing but a gay-bashing bigot who makes wild claims , then surely you can refute my claim with facts pertaining to the topic in bold , can't you ? But , if I'm actually NOT a gay-bashing bigot and have the facts to back up my claim , then you'd better continue with the subterfuge , deflection and dismissals because all you will have is fraudulent PC rhetoric .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I wouldn't unless you were using it as justification to ban buses in New York . Exactly the point I am trying to make to , JP . Thank you . <br> <br><b>Key</b> 1-6646_188_186__190_191_219_220_6 <br><b>Dialogtext</b> <br><b>S1:1-  </b>http://www.infopt.demon.co.uk/marriage.htm This site shows a large range of historical instances of gay marriage . Romans did it , so did celts , greeks http://www.generationq.net/articles/...3401cacd56d303 This one focuses on marriage in american-indian tribes , and how the homosexuals were actually greatly valued as healers and prophets . Just take a look at the Old Testament to find marriages between one man and many women . Polygamy is also present in African and Islamic culture too . And in some tribes in Nigeria , there is a culture of polyandry ( one woman , many men ) . So marriage is not some one man , one woman thing that has been adhered to since time began . As an ' ideal ' , it's far more recent that you might think . Smiley<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Marriage has always been about different genders . I made no mention of solely one to one . If you look closely at history you will find that marriage ( a couple of Bhuddist sects apart ) has always been between opposite genders . There have been cultures where homosexual relationships have existed for short periods and often for specific cultural purposes but marriage per se has been between opposite genders . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Evidently you didn't read the links I gave you . To put it another way , there are many many examples of gay marriage throughout history . This idea that it is new and abnormal is ridiculous . Smiley<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I clearly did , I suspect you may have but didn't understand . None of those unions were accepted to be marriage but unions for a particular purpose . Marriage took place later between man and woman . Your concept is new . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>That's interesting !! You made the point about marriage having been an opposite sex institution before . I gave many examples of societies where same sex marriage was commonplace . You then said that they weren't really marriage because marriage was something new . Now you're saying that same sex marriage has been against society's beliefs since the year dot . So is marriage a new thing that is only a male-female thing , or is marriage something that has been around since the year dot ( and would include those examples that I gave - American Indian berdaches , gay marriage within early Roman society etc ) ? I assume early Roman society falls within the year-dot-till-now period . Smiley<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Same sex marriage has never been commonplace . There are a couple of Bhuddist sects who allow it . It was definitely frowned on in Roman Times . The Greeks had homosexual liaisons , some from desire , some for a form of mentoring reasons . They were never marriages and never assumed to be so by those Societies . Those Greek Roman Chinese and any other Society accepted certain homosexual liaisons but marriage was something else . It was between people of opposite genders and that is not new it was how it was originally <br> <br><b>Key</b> 1-6646_150_144_1_151_152_154_156_161_11 <br><b>Dialogtext</b> <br><b>S1:1-  </b>It's good to see all of the apologists coming out of the woodwork to argue against someone else's strawman argument . I've yet to see one person argue that AIDS wasn't initially spread in the US primarily by gays . Let's focus on what I really said , not what you would have liked me to have said .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yes you are right gay people were the first victims of the plague and yes gay people were the first to spread it within the US Is that the pat on the back you want ? It was also spread initially by blood transfusions . Do you then agree with Paul Cameron ? " At the 1985 Conservative Political Action Conference , Cameron announced to the attendees , ' Unless we get medically lucky , in three or four years , one of the options discussed will be the extermination of homosexuals . ' According to an interview with former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop , Cameron was recommending the extermination option as early as 1983 . " - Mark E. Pietrzyk , News-Telegraph , March 10 , 1995 . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No , what I want is an apology for being called a bigot for stating a fact !!!! Of course not , but that doesn't change the fact that I am angry that its here and consumes many good people and lots of resources that could be better spent curing cancer and other diseases , all because of the promiscuity of a small minority of the population .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So the lives of gay people are less important ? The statement you made is a bigoted statement . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Still throwing out strawmen , Matthew ? Show me where I EVER claimed that the lives of gays were less important .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Right here You have implied that those that the lives of those who catch and spread hiv , largely gay men in the US , are not as important and worth curing as those with cancer and other diseases . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>That's an inaccurate interpretation of what I wrote . I said that , had we not had all of this HIV in the US , our medical resources could have been doing something else , like finding a cure for cancer . That's a far cry from saying that now that we have AIDS , we should forget those infected and research something else . <br> <br><b>Key</b> 1-6646_268_261_1_272_274_289_290_291_293_294_13 <br><b>Dialogtext</b> <br><b>S1:1-  </b>It seems to me that the point there is that it is not a bigot ... er , spade merely because you CALL it a spade . IMO , if someone has to resort to name-calling , it tends to only indicate they are having to resort to something besides sound arguments .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Oh my . Perhaps we should say it's an anti-gay bias , or a person with an anit-gay bias ? Are the terms acceptance-challenged , inclusion-challenged , anti-discrimination challenged , appealing to you ? E Mutz or his " Joe " , assumed those protesting against gay discrimination are nuts or trying to hijack heritage , but won't say why . If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , chances are ... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Or maybe he's simply arguing a different point than you . IMO it's just simply arrogant of you to automatically write off disagreement as " bigotry " . YOUR view is that this is about " acceptance " ; but that doesn't mean that's the real issue . E Mutz is right in saying that disagreement is not the same as bigotry .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>What is the basis for the disagreement or the different point of view if it is not a lack of acceptance of homosexuality or its visible and open displays and representations ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>But the problem is that you insist on always mischaracterizing that as bigotry . It's a very ugly word , and I suspect that's the reason you use it ( for its effect ) and why you don't entertain the idea that bigotry may not always be what's behind it .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I say it is , and I explain why . Replace the word " gay " with another minority , and tell me it is not . It's an ugly thing . I've explained why I believe that's what's behind it . If you believe don't believe that , why don't you tell me what is behind it ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I think it all goes back to one's motivations . What I don't think you and some others understand is that people often don't take that stand on the basis of not liking gay people . They do it because of the way they view marriage . If any other minority came along wanting marriage to be changed from one man and one woman , I suspect they'd get the same response .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>We weren't just discussing marriage specifically . Somehow whenever gays are involved , a group of people take a stand of being opposed , because of the way they view one thing or another in society , as being straight-only , or excluding gays . Yes , from the anti-gay crowd , sorry those who don't wish to include gays . However , no other identified minority would want that , because only one minority identifies as gay . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>But it's not always about not-including-gays . That's not the basis in many cases . ( hey , that rhymes ! ) It's about the way they view marriage ! They'd be that way toward any group wanting to change marriage to fit themselves if it changed marriage from the traditional view . I assure you if there was a movement afoot in this country by polygamists to change marriage to include them , there would be a similar reaction toward that . It's not that you're gay . It's that you want to redefine marriage . Ah , there's no use . I've tried to get you to see this before .</body> </html>
