 S1 argues that most people in the country might identify as Christian and that questioning a study is a very appropriate response to one that vilifies a group of people. They believe that there is a lot of attention given to trying to make Christianity look bad through generalization, irrelevant studies and misinterpretations. They believe the divorce rate of Christians has no bearing on the gay marriage amendment.
 S2 believes that S1 is making up objections and deciding without any factual evidence. He or she believes that objections should not be hypothetical, but actual proven ones. This person thinks that dismissing results, rather than checking validity is reactionary. This person thinks it is relevant as long as people say they are protecting the sanctity of marriage.

 S1 claims that the problem with an unmentioned study is that the majority of people identify as Christian, but he also recognizes S2's argument that more details of the study would be helpful to determine whether this is actually a problem. S1 also claims that the forum tends to make Christianity look bad, and points out that the divorce rate of Christians is irrelevant to the gay marriage amendment. 
 S2 defends the unmentioned study by suggesting that S1 is unaware of the particular details of the study which could invalidate his argument. He also suggests that S1 dismissed the results of the study without trying to understand them, and that the study was in fact well done and any objections should be based on evidence.

 S1 is uncomfortable with the study because there isn't information on how they got the results. S1 goes on to say the study vilifies a group of people, namely Christians, and that most people in the country may identify as Christian. S1 also thinks the divorce rate of Christians has no bearing on the issue of gay marriage. S2 thinks S1 should ask questions about the study rather than just assume it is incorrect and that it isn't being used to vilify anyone. S1 thinks the results are professional and S1 is just uncomfortable with the results. S2 thinks the divorce rate of Christians is very important to the issue because Christians say they are protecting the "sanctity" of marriage.

 S1 feels much more clarification is needed as to how the study was conducted and who conducted it.  S1 also feels forums such as this one spend too much time attempting to make Christians look bad.  S1 also feels that divorce rates among Christians has nothing to do with the issue of gay marriage. S1 accuses S2 of being a reactionist.
 
 S2 believes S1 is bringing up random,factless arguments without factual information arguing the study seems to be well and professionally done.  S2 also feels that the issues are being dismissed by S1 instead of being met by providing a valid argument.  S2 believes citing the protection of the sanctity of marriage makes the study's arguments relevant by supporting their arguments.

 Two people are discussing the validity of a gay marriage study.  S1 states that a problem with the study is that most people in the country identifies as Christian. S2 states that since the specifics are unknown, questioning them would just be making up objections without factual evidence.  S1 states that questioning a study is appropriate, especially if it vilifies a group of people.  S2 contradicts, stating that the study was done professionally, stating that no one is vilifying anyone.  S1 states that the divorce rate of Christians has nothing to do with gay marriage, to which S2 states that as long as they're trying to protect marriage by keeping gays out, it's relevant.

I'm not saying businesses can't legally do it -- they can -- I'm saying I think it's pretty unethical . It's easy for you to sit back and say what you're saying when you dislike religion , but this is no different than an employer telling a gay employee they can't express themselves as being gay on the job .

A better analogy would be if you were trying to force a Jewish employee , whom you KNEW was Jewish , to work on his sabbath rather than being willing to work with him about that . Or to suddenly tell him he has to eat a pork sandwich or something . And remember , this is a different issue than benignly serving food . We're talking about a major religious issue here -- gay marriage , to religious people , is like asking them to approve most any bad thing in society you can think of .

Does God pay their paychecks or do the taxpayers ? They just have to sign a civil contract . So what if that person is the only person able to do marriage contracts in the area . How does the state ensure that gay people can exersize their right to marriage if the only person able to perform the marriage is exempted from perfoming the marriage based upon religious beliefs ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I just think you are viewing this the wrong way -- making it more complicated than it is . It is simply a provision that allows a person to let someone else conduct the civil ceremony if their religious beliefs don't allow them to do it . The same idea that would allow a Jewish person to pass on eating pork if it were suddenly expected for him or her to do it when it wasn't before . That's all this is -- let's not make mountains out of molehills ...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yet what if there is no one else in the community ?

 S1 and S2 are discussing a seemingly pending law that would permit marriage officials to decline to conduct gay marriages if they are opposed to them on religious principals.  S1 finds it acceptable, while S2 complains about it.  S1 proposes that it is easy for S2 to be unsympathetic because S2 dislikes religion.  S1 acknowledges that he considers such religious objections to be evil.  He suggests that because the individual licensed to perform a marriage is paid or licensed by the State, the individual should reflect the will and choices of the State and therefore perform gay marriages despite his or her personal religious objection to them.  S2 suspects that the law may result in an effective denial of gay marriage.

 S1 believes that religious freedom allows for people to not do something, such as serve a gay customer, that they find objective to their religion. He gives an example that Jewish people should not be forced to work on the Sabbath or eat pork. Likewise, he thinks Christians should not be required to serve gay people in a way that violates their religious beliefs. S2 believes it should be a requirement that you serve all customers and gives the example that he couldn't refuse to serve a boy scout or Christian that he doesn't agree with. He goes on to say that taxpayers and employers are the ones providing the paycheck, not God. He believes service is a requirement to express the freedom people have.

 The issues here appears to stem from an employee citing some religious view to his/her boss indicating why they cannot perform a job duty.
 
 Speaker one doesn't think people should pick and choose what they want equal rights on, in this case between religion and other rights issues, that it should be all or nothing. Speaker one therefore believes that speaker two is unfairly discriminating against an employee based off their religious views.
 
 Speaker two believes that society dictates that you have to be biased at times. Speaker two continues that if speaker one's logic holds true, then he/she should be able to turn away customers based off his/her own personal religious views.

 Two people are discussing equality and natural rights.  S1 states that discrimination on people for being religious and keeping people from religion infringes on natural rights, and if you are for equality for gays then you need equality for all.  S2 states that this allows people to do whatever they want and use their religious beliefs as an excuse.  To contradict, S1 states that only serious religious views are taken into account.  S2 then proposes a scenario where the only person available to perform the gay marriage ceremony is exempted based on religious beliefs, their rights won't be upholded.  S1 rebuts by stating that the proposed provision would allow someone else, and this is due to religious freedom.

 Two people are discussing gay marriage.  The discussion revolves around whether or not a clergy person should have the right to refuse to marry a gay couple based on religious beliefs.  S1 believes this is alright to do while S2 does not agree.  S2 provides an example of his/her managing a restaurant asking if it would be acceptable for him to refuse to serve a boy scout based on the fact they conflict with his/her religious beliefs.  He/she also believes clergy members should not be permitted to refuse a union due to the fact the tax payers pay the salary of such people.  S1 feels forcing this issue is the equivalent to forcing a Jewish person to eat pork sandwiches.

 S1, a heterosexual, and S2, a homosexual, discuss the justness of the legislative process, majority rule, and how the latter affects individuals and the gay community.  S2 describes how the gay community is discriminated against, and posits that because laws regarding homosexuals impact them more directly than the general population, it is unfair to have a majority rule apply.  S1 accuses S2 of not understanding the legal system and proposes that S2 find majority to have legislation passed, and not look to the courts to redress the discrimination.  S1 analogizes that process to how slavery was abolished, and also analogizes the alleged oppression to the oppression that may be felt by anti-abortion advocates and child molesters as a result of majority rule.

 S1 believes that the majority rules no matter what the minority thinks. He thinks this is the way the law works and that it doesn't matter how an individual feels. It matters what the majority votes on. He cites slavery as an example. If someone wants a law changed S1 thinks they should get the majority to side with them and change it. S2 thinks that S1 doesn't understand because he is heterosexual and not the one being oppressed. S2 believes that the courts should look at individuals lives and the effect of laws on everyone. He thinks if a law is unjust then it should be overturned regardless of what the majority wants. He thinks conservatives are heartless and don't care if people suffer.

 Speaker one is a heterosexual who believes that in our democratic society, the majority rules, and that this majority has so far consistently ruled again gay rights. Speaker one believes that courts should not overturn decisions based off the minority complaining and should abide by the majority, how our constitution and government was designed.
 
 Speaker two believes that the majority is oppressing the LGBT community and being treated as second-class citizens. The speaker believes that if a law effects an individuals' life in an unjust way, then it is courts responsibility to overrule it for the individual's sake. Speaker two believes society is oppressing people, and that if a law adversely effects even one person, it is unjust.

 Two subjects are discussing a law banning gay marriage.  S2 believes the law is unjust as it segregates the gay community from that of the heterosexual community.

S2 believes the courts should take individuals' into consideration and rule on each instead of as a whole.  S1 contends this idea to be incorrect citing the fact that those who believe abortion should be illegal are technically the minority and that a court would not rule on that issue individually.

 S1 and S2 are discussing a legislative action associated with a Massachusetts court ruling which is favorable to gay rights.  S1 is enthusiastic about the matter and sees it as a step in the right direction against bigotry, and a recognition that the world is not as anti-gay as it used to be, which S2 is advised to acknowledge and accept.  S1 also accuses S2 of being inconsistent in having been on the record on the website opposing gay marriage (and therefor according to S1 being opposed to equal rights for gays), but now also taking a position that the state should not intervene to ban gay marriage.  S2 defends that position and argues it is based on conservative principles against intrusions into individual lives.

 S1 believes the world changed with the legislation in Massachusetts to allow gay marriage. He assumes that S2, having stated several times he is against gay marriage, will hope the legislation is overturned but may be out of luck. He questions if S2's opinion has changed now that gay marriage is in place in Massachusetts and if he wants it overturned. S2 resents the assumption of S1 and says that legislation to overturn the Massachusetts decision would be an over intrusion by the government. He states that he would not want an amendment to ban gay marriage and that has always been his opinion because he does not agree with over intrusion by the government. He sees this as a true conservative opinion to take.

 Speaker two has opposed gay marriage and likely equal rights for gays in the past, but opinions that the cause of this opposition is that the speaker believes that government is over-intruding by creating legislature regarding the topic of gay marriage.

 S1 and S2 discuss the civil benefits of marriage and how they could or could not be extended to single people and gay people.  S1 is initially against government being involved in the equation, but after S2 describes many of the legal rights and benefits associated with marriage, such as automatic inheritance and hospital visitation rights, S1 is then able to relate to the issues by considering the case of his life-long bachelor uncle, suggesting that it is single people who are discriminated against by being excluded from the marriage benefits.  S2 suggests that if a single person desires the benefits of marriage, they should marry, but that they should be able to marry a person of either gender as they see fit.

 S1 thinks that the government should stay out of marriage and that it should be left to religious institutions. He thinks there needs to be a better system and that single people are the ones that are harmed the most by marriage laws because they are unable to get any of the benefits that married people do even if they want them, or it is important to their situation. S2 says religious ceremonies aren't what gay people want because they already can have them via churches. They want the rights and to keep the government out would be to give up those rights. If single people want those rights they should get married, but he thinks you should be free to marry who you wish.

 The issue here is whether government or religion should decides the principles of marriage, and who is allowed to get married.

 S1 presents the idea that gay marriage has been pervasive in many cultures, including the Romans, Greeks, Celts, and American Indians. He also mentions the existence of other alternative forms of marriage such as polygamy and polyandry. He claims that gay marriage is not a new idea and that the idea of marriage being between a man and a woman is a recent development.
 S2 claims that although homosexual acts did occur in many past cultures, these relationships were not marriages. He insists that marriages were almost exclusively between people of opposite genders. He argues that same-sex marriage has never been commonplace or accepted, despite homosexual acts occurring at times, and that the original idea of marriage is a union between people of opposite genders.

 S1 provides two websites which outline the history of gay marriage in a few different cultures advising homosexuals were held in high regard in some cultures and were thought of as healers and prophets.  S1 cites several cultures who practices gay unions such as Romans and Celts.  S1 advises some cultures still practice polygamy and one in Nigeria  even practices polyandry. 
 
 S1 advises while homosexual unions were present in history they were not actually thought of as marriages but more of unions for a specific purpose.  He/she contends that matrimonial unions were between opposite genders, even throughout history.  S1 concedes that homosexual liaisons were common in other times and cultures but never recognized as actual marriages and were frowned upon.

 Two people are discussing gay marriage. S1 states that gay marriage is not a new idea, as many societies have historically practiced it and in some cases the homosexuals were valued.  He also asserts that even in the old testament marriage was not just between one man and one woman; polygamy was present.  S2 states that historically marriage has been about different genders.  He then states that even though the societies had homosexual liaisons, but they were not regarded as marriage but as unions for a particular purpose.  In some cases they were even frowned upon.

 S1 bring sup historical evidence in support that homosexual marriage was conducted in the past, naming the Romans, Celts, Greeks and Native American tribes. They argue that such unions were important in the Native American tribe's culture as these individuals were seen as healers and prophets. They also point out that polygamy has been around historically as well, and argues that marriage has never been a binary union between one man and one woman.
 S2 responds by stating that the evidence provided does not classify these unions as marriage, but special case scenarios that do not overlap with existing marriage laws in existence. They argue that marriage has always been considered to be between one man and one woman and that homosexual liaisons were special cases.

 S1 asserts that gay marriage and polygamy are commonplace in ancient Greece, Rome and China. He listed hyperlinks to the source of his assertion. He argues that marriage as a union between one man and one woman is a recent construct as compared to gay marriage.
 S2 asserts that same-sex marriage has never been commonplace. He argues that a couple of Buddhist sects allow it. It was frowned upon in Roman times. The Greeks had homosexual liaisons, some from desire, some for a form of mentoring reasons. But those were neither marriages nor assumed to be so by those societies. Marriage is between people of opposite genders in those societies, and thus it is not a new concept.

 S1 claims that the gay community is the cause of the AIDs epidemic in the US and that homosexuals and their advocates attempt to divert attention from this fact by tracing the origin of the disease to Africa. He believes that the existence of AIDs in Africa has nothing to do with AIDs in the US and that it should be ignored.
 S2 argues that discussing AIDs in Africa is relevant to AIDs in the US and point out how AIDs is used as a justification for those who oppose gay rights. He suggests that the statistics regarding AIDs in Africa show that it is not simply a homosexual disease and that AIDs should therefore not be used as a justification to make gay marriage illegal.

 S1 feels the topic of AIDS in the U.S. being spread by the gay community is avoiding by returning to the argument that AIDS originated in Africa.  S1 requests factual proof that his groups' statements are untrue.  He/she advises citing feelings or wants is not providing proof but deflecting the topic.
 
 S2 argues that by blaming the gay community for AIDS' spreading in America, S1's group is opening the door for the argument that the disease originated elsewhere.  S2 feels the opposing group is using the spread of AIDS as a basis for banning gay marriage. He/she feels doing so is like saying if a bus hit a group of people in Africa, then buses should be banned in New York.

 Two people are discussing the spread of AIDS in the US as part of a discussion on gay marriage in the USA. S1 states that location is relevant, as the way AIDS spread in Africa is different from how it spreads in the US. He continues to state that AIDS spread in the US because of the gay community, and the gay community continually tries to deflect the argument and include Africa in the discussion instead of providing real facts.  S2 argues that bringing up the topic of AIDS is solely as a weapon against gays, and that the location of the AIDS epidemic is irrelevant to the discussion. He then states that Africa is included in order to refute the opposing logic.

 S1 believes that those who defend homosexual activity deflect the question of an AIDS epidemic in the United States by bringing up statistics for it in Africa. They believe that such arguments have no place in an argument about homosexual marriage and are blatant attempts to sidetrack the argument. They believe that AIDS became an epidemic in the United States through the homosexual male community, and that all evidence should be contained and localized in the United States when arguing a point.
 S2 refutes this by stating that statistics in Africa are brought up to counter arguments that blame the homosexual community for the United States epidemic. They believe that if one broaches the topic of AIDS one must also look at it as a whole.

He challenges S2 to refute his assertion with proof. S1 said that he is not a bigot, but that he is just presenting a fact of how AIDs became an epidemic in the US through the gay community. S2 asserts that S1 did not present his statistics as a discussion about the progression of AIDS in the US. Rather, S1 presented his statistics to justify opposition to gay rights. S2 brought out AIDs in Africa because location is irrelevant in refuting S1's logic.

 S1 claims that his opposition to gay marriage is based on the belief that it will hurt more people than it helps, not on bigotry. He suggests that it would hurt people with a traditional view of marriage as between a man and a woman, and that the benefits of marriage can be gained by homosexuals without redefining marriage.
 S2 argues that gay marriage does not hurt anyone, straight or gay, and offending proponents of traditional marriage is not a valid argument against it. He believes that preventing gay marriage is simply faith based hate. He claims that having separate rules for straight and gay marriage creates the possibility of those rules being different for the two groups, allowing the gay minority to be disenfranchised.

 S1 believes since gay couples qualify for the same benefits as married heterosexual couples there is no reason to allow for gay marriage advising his/her agreeing with these points does not make him/her a bigot.  S1 feels supporting arguments with logic eliminates the ability to label one as a bigot.
 
 S2 feels not redefining marriage to allow for same sex couples to unite leaves the door open for gay couples to not be given the same rights and benefits as hetero couples.  He/she believes as long as there is a separate set of standards there can be rule changes to prevent their benefits. S2 concedes that S1 is not labeled as a bigot but supports those who are in a sense bigots or supporters.

 Two people are discussing about redefining the meaning of marriage.  S1 thinks that it is unnecessary to redefine marriage to include gays.  He states that all of the rights and benefits that married couples have are already granted to gays without the need for redefining.  Redefining only serves to hurt the many people who see marriage as a sacred bond between man and woman.  S2 thinks that it is necessary to redefine marriage. If not, the rights and benefits granted to gays will not be guaranteed.  Also, he believes that offending someone's sensibility is not real, measurable damage, so there is not reason not to redefine marriage, not doing so only appeases faith justified hate.

 S2 does not believe that offending one group of individuals counts as damage, but they do believe that appeasing faith justified hate does.

 S1 believes that a big 'bunch' of people cherish the notion that marriage is a sacred bond of union between a man and a woman. Redefining marriage to include same-sex couples upsets the sensitivities of these people. This is unnecessary because it is possible for gay couples to obtain rights similar to married couples without having to redefine marriage.
 S2 asserts that redefining marriage to include same-sex couples does not harm anyone. He said that offending the sensibilities of people does not constitute harm. He claims that evidence show that the majority of people do not want to grant same-sex couples rights similar to marriage under a separate label. Hence gays have to resort to redefining marriage to secure legal rights under the marriage arrangement.

 S1 claims that it is inappropriate to label disagreement as bigotry, and that while someone might think an argument is bigoted, it may be motivated by something other than bigotry. He argues that many people's opinions are based on their view of marriage, not their dislike of homosexuals, and that they would be against any group wanting to alter the traditional view of marriage.

S2 refutes this by saying it is a bigoted statement; as it means the lives of gay people are less important.

If you are free to do it , then she is as well . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Should the majority have the right to enslave their fellow citizens ? Should the majority have the right to lock people up in concentration camps ? A majority of the people in the US once thought it was a good idea . Oh I want the evil woman to say it . I want her viciousness and ugliness out in the open . If she is anti gay then she needs to own up to her bigotry Repent America believes in protesting and disrupting gay gatherings . Why If they can do this I can do the same .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The majority DID have the legal right ( unfortunately ) to enslave their fellow citizens until the 13 th Amendment took that option off the table . Incidentally , it took a majority of people to take slavery off of the table . In the United States , the majority wins ( for good or for ill ) . I hope you are not trying to make a comparison between the denial of marriage to gays ( and to 10 year olds , and to those who are currently married yet want another husband / wife , and to those who wish to marry their father , etc. ) on the one hand , and slavery and / or concentration camps on the other . Ok , and what would that accomplish ? Yeah , that's exactly what I said . <br><br><b>Summaries</b><br>

 S1 and S2 are talking about how Democracy is based on majority rule and whether or not its fair. S1 believes it is completely unfair that gay marriage be dismissed or disliked and S2 argues that no matter what S1 believes is right or wrong, the majority of people control what is normal in our society. That if S1 is only towards the rights of gay people it is completely understandable for this lady to be in belief that marriage as is is fine. S2 believes that S1's argument is not a legitimate viewpoint because S1 has no justification that this lady hates gays. S1 believes that because this lady is not in favor of gay marriage, the lady is anti-gay. S1 is taking an aggressive approach by saying they will talk to bible churches and disrupt them because she feels like she has no place in society. S1 thinks that the majority of people is enslaving their people by not allowing gay rights, but S2 argues that it happens that way and it changes over time.

 S1 does not believe S2 has answered her question of how equal marriage hurts any heterosexual.  S2 believes the point has been made because different laws affect different people.  S2 attacks S1 by calling their argument "silly" because it violates the First amendment rights. S2 remarks that S1 is only concerned with the rights of gay and the anti-gay Christianity. S1 specifically names a woman in particular to admit her discrimination. S1 expresses that the rights of gays is their first concern and protection from church. S1 threatens to respond with similar actions against the church, like protesting ceremonial events and church services.  S2 urges S1 to allow the democratic process to decide the issue, believing the anti-gay movement may also have legitimacy. S1 questions the majority rule ideology because of incidents in the past like slavery and concentration camps., and once again calls out the women. S2 ends by stating those would not be possible today because of the 13th amendment.

 (S1) states how can gay marriage hurt politicians or anyone else? (S2) says that there are laws that hurt all kinds of peoples and argues about violation of the First Amendment by imposing someone's belief over another. (S1) argues that he is only concern with gay peoples rights and says that the politician wants gays to remain as second-class citizens. Argues that politician/she is discriminating and protecting her heterosexual privilege. He also argues that not accepting gay marriage is punishment to him, his family and others. (S2) He argues about the kind of democracy in where majority of the people decide what best for society and how being anti-gay is a right of the First Amendment.  Is a gay person is allowed to have the freedom, so does he who and others who may not agree. (S1) then gives the example that not just because majority rules it means that it's a good thing. For example, enslaving people was accepted in previous societies. (S2) argues that although previous societies had legal rights to enslave people but that doesn't mean that it makes those decisions all the time and that is like gay marriage.

  S1 asks S2 how equal marriage would hurt someone, "her", or anyone else. S1's way of equal marriage would not S1 or her. S1 is only concerned with gay rights and will talk people out of attending bible churches. S1 will try to legally disrupt any of the fundraising activities that they have going on, protest their weddings and their services. Once they crossed the line and enacted laws that hurt S1 and S1's family, then they have no place in society. The majority should not have the right to enslave their fellow citizens and send them to concentration camps. She should admit to her bigotry, discrimination and anti-gay views.
  
  
  S2 is glad that S1 abandoned a silly argument about the violation of the first amendment right, but still does not see why only laws that do not cause harm should be enacted. S2 is surprised at S1's affinity for the harm principle given that S1 has expressed being at war with evangelical anti-gay christianity. S2 holds that people should be about to legislate their views, and wants S1 to explain why that shouldn't be so with anti-gay people. In a democracy like ours people use the democratic process to have views enacted into law. If she is free to do this, then so is S1.

 S1 questions to how equal marriages hurts the woman or any other heterosexual. The only person that gets hurt is S1. If equal marriage is incorporated into the law then nobody gets hurt. S2 talks about what if a proposed law hurt someone and that there are all kinds of laws that hurt all kinds of people. S1 says he is only concerned with the rights of gay people. He calls the woman evil and that she should admit that she is anti-gay and wants to protect her heterosexual privilege. S2 believes that S1 just cares about gay people but has not shown why anti-gay people should not be able to legislate their view. S2 says that S1 and the woman both have their own opinions. S1 asks whether the majority should have the right to enslave their fellow citizens or lock people up in concentration camps. S2 responds saying the majority did have the right to enslave fellow citizens until the 13th amendment took place and says that the majority wins in the united states.

 This is about gay marriage. S1 seems to believe that someone is making religion into law by saying marriage should be between a heterosexual couple. S2 is arguing that S1's point is not very valid because S1 is not understanding that they are not using the persons perspective. S1 believes that that person is trying to hurt them, while S2 is saying that the person may not necessarily be that way and that the person may be arguing for what they believe to be greater for society, based on their own perspective. S1's religious view of marriage is based on two people's love for each other, while the other person believes its between a man and woman. S2 says S1's argument is empty and that S1 is not showing how the other person is being hurt by gay marriage. S2 thinks S1 is not understanding the overall perspectives and just focusing on their own needs. S1 states that the person's religion put into law affects peoples ability to marry if they are gay, but that S1's religion on marriage put into law would not affect marriage for anyone.

 S1 and S2 are discussing gay marriage in the context of an unknown "she" that is pushing a law to ban gay marriage. S1 believes that her religious freedom is being persecuted from people against gay marriage.  S1 believes this will result in her family not having legal protection. S2 doesn't believe that S1's religious freedom is being persecuted because she is still bale to hold religious ceremonies. S2 believes the same argument can be made fro m her perspective. S1's believe of marriage is that it should be based on love and not on sex. S2 argues that the religious freedom argument could be used in any format to justify any action. S1 is angered that the religious freedom of another person will go into law and bar her from marriage so she can sustain her heterosexual privilege.  S2 disagrees and thinks "she" is doing what she thinks is before society. S1 and S2 seem to get annoyed with each other by the end of dialog.

 (S1) says that his religious freedom is being ignored by a politician attempting to make her religious beliefs law.  This law limits legal protection of gay couples and it is not use to protect marriage but heterosexual privilege. (S2)  questions how the politicians view is imposing on (S1) religious freedom. (S1) responds that he believes that marriage should be between two people who love each other and not her/politicians belief that marriage should be between man and woman. However, (S2) says that the argument surrounding religious freedom is an empty argument because anyone can argue for his or her beliefs using religion. (S1) says that gay marriage doesn't violate her/politicians rights of heterosexual privilege, entitlement since she is not protecting marriage but her beliefs. (S2) questions how (S1) religious rights are taken away or harmed. (S1) and (S2) discuss about whose religious belief is better for society.

  S1 says that someone, "her", is trying to put their religious beliefs into law that goes against the religious beliefs of S1.  The law would bar the family of S1 from legal protections but would not affect her. S1 believes that she isn't protecting marriage but preserving her heterosexual privilege. Her religious belief is that marriage should be between a man and a woman but S1 believes that marriage should be between two people in a loving relationship regardless of sex. If she put her religious belief into law it would hurt S1 but if the religious views of S1 are put into law she would still be able to choose who she wanted and S1 would be able to choose whomever. She is trying to keep gay people out of marriage.
  
  
  S2 understands the perspective of S1 but does not think it is a valid argument. S2 holds that either if either religious belief were put into law that it would infringe on the other's beliefs. S2 claims that S1 has not shown how the religious beliefs would be taken away from such a law. It can be argued in other ways but the idea of not giving gays marriage benefits is imposing on religious freedom is an empty argument. S2 counters S1 by saying that it is impossible to know whether or not she is trying to turn religious belief into law. It is impossible to know or to police someone's real motives.

 S1 is talking about a female who is ignoring S1's religious freedom and barring his family from legal protections. S2 questions to how she is impeding S1 from his religious freedom and argues that she isn't trying to take away his right from a religious ceremony. S1 says the woman's religious belief is that marriage should be between a man and a woman, and S1's religious belief is that marriage can be between any two people that love each other regardless of their gender. If the woman's religious belief gets incorporated in to the law, S1 will not be able to marry the person of his choice but she will still be able to marry regardless of the law. The woman is just trying to keep gay people out of marriage to preserve her heterosexual privilege. S2 argues that either one of them can be impeding on the others religious freedom. S1 does not give in and keeps arguing that she is trying to turn her religious belief into law and bar him from getting married. 
 
 <br><br><b>Key</b><br> 1-8376_58_41__59_68_69_70_71_73_1 <br><b>Dialog</b> <br><b>S1:1-  </b>Lesz , My marriage means a great many things to me , none of which have anything to do with our governments . My question to you is : What do you think marriage should mean to our governments ?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Well , marriage is an ancient human institution , based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans , and is one of the foundations of social stability . Why would it surprise anyone that government might wish to support it ? What really surprises me is to find how many alleged Christians NOW find it expedient to demand government " get out of marriage " , simply because gay people want to get in it . Bunch of hypocrites -- they never complained about government regulating marriage before this . Now , while I agree it isn't absolutely essential for government to be involved in the regulation and support of marriage , it is nevertheless a convenience that few people would really want to throw away . ( Mr. WriteLA has summed it up eloquently so I needn't elaborate . ) Alas , many are just too mean-spirited to share marriage with those pesky homos , so they've jumped on the get-out-of-marriage bandwagon -- which isn't going to go anywhere -- as camouflage for their real feelings . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That government would wish to be involved in any aspect of our lives , would not surprise me . That is what governments tend to do . Consider the " Healthy Marriage Initiative " . This is our government and as citizens , we would be well advised to exercise vigilance to prevent our government from intruding into areas where there is no necessity . Just because a few mean-spirited hypocrites may advocate that the government get out of marriage for the wrong reasons does not mean that the idea is all bad . Never happen ? Enlist the 100 single people who have the biggest stake in this issue and chip away at the exclusive benefits . Start with an easy one like hospital visitation and work up to the tough ones like Social Security to spouses<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Why ? Why is it in the interests of society to prevent government involvement in marriage ? That's what you haven't explained . MrWriteLA pointed out the reasons that government involvement is pretty much unavoidable , if only because government is the source of law . It seems to me you advocate the replacement of marriage with a plethora of minor and specific legal contracts that would only benefit the lawyers writing them . It's the wood and the trees . If specific laws are trees , then marriage is the forest that protects our relationships from such gales that XXXX . Is there any specific advantage to looking to individual trees and ignoring the wood ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Lesz I ask why and you ask why not . Why should government get out of the marriage business : 1 . It is not needed 2 . The current marriage benefits are terribly unfair to single people that are forced to pay for them . Your eloquence notwithstanding , I have found it useful to look very closely at the trees when solving problems . I would suggest that one cannot understand the wood unless one knows something about trees . Also , I have often found it useful to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller parts and solving the easiest parts first .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Why is government support of marriage unfair to single people ? Single people do not have the same issues as married people . Having been married and single myself , I do have some insight here . And why would you rather married people go to lawyers for multiple legal contracts to cover all the hundreds of rights and mutual obligations currently conferred by marriage ? Are you a lawyer in need of clients ? ;) My own experience of woods and trees is that there is no value in looking at them in only one way . One needs to consider them as trees and woods . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I have also been single and married . Experience but not much insight . I would be interested to hear your views about this difference in issues and how these issues are helped by government involvement . Lesz , I am an engineer , not a lawyer .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Well , single people live by themselves , not as a family . By definition , they do not have a significant relationship -- and no , I don't count boyfriends or girlfriends here , I am referring to committed couples who live together as a family unit . There are many legal issues such as inheritance , pension and social security rights , adoption and child custody , home ownership , etc. , which would need separate legal contracts without the umbrella of marriage . ( And of course , even then such contracts would only be enforceable by government . ) I myself had tremendous difficulties sorting out property issues with my partner's family after he died . It all but bankrupted me , and there wouldn't have been any issue at all had it been legal for us to get married . We did have some legal contracts pertaining to the house , and wills , but alas they weren't good enough to get his family off my back , because our legal relationship was trumped by his familial one . I am not saying it couldn't be done piecemeal , tailor-made to suit each individual couple , but wouldn't that be excessively inconvenient -- for everyone but the lawyers ? Whereas at prresent , when you get married for a $25 license , hey presto , you get those protections and the lawyers have to defer their Caribbean cruise . <br><br><b>Summaries</b><br>

  S1 and S2 are debating the topic of what marriage should mean to our government. S1 Believes it is not a bad idea because they think it is not necessary for the government to be involved in most aspects of our lives, while S2 is questioning why it's necessary to try and remove government involvement when it is unavoidable. S1 brings up that because several people are against the government due to gay marriage and not because it's just marriage altogether, it doesn't mean it's not a bad idea to remove government intervention. S1 mentions the "Healthy Marriage Initiative" and how it isn't necessary. S2 says that there is too much legal work and documents behind marriage in the government, such as inheritance, pension and social rights, etc., and that it would be a lot more work if the government didn't intervene, also stating that removing marriage from government will only benefit lawyers. Both S1 and S2 have had experience with marriage, S2 states that marriage benefits are good because of government intervention.

  This discussion is about the government roll in marriage, specifically pertaining to homosexual marriage. S1 believes that the government should have no say in marriage. S2 believes that government should have a say in marriage because it is more practical in today's world. S1 believes that individual contracts by lawyers  rather than the government being involved would be the fairest compromise. S2 encountered problems with this view in their personal life when their partner died, and they were unable to sort out all of the legal issues involved in death, like inheritance, or social security rights.  S2 believes there will be privileges that come only in government recognized unions. S1 comments best way to go about solving these problems is to take them one issue at a time rather then facing the problem as a whole. S2 thinks that you need to look at situations in from different perspectives like trees in the woods.  Both S1 and S2 have previous experience with married life and single life.

But you do see an inconsistency with your stated opinion statement . Quite frankly , I really haven't seen you SHOW an inconsistency yet . You have said " inconsistency " , but not show it . It's a bit like saying " Frank is inconsistent on the abortion issue " , but that's it . It would be showing an inconsistency to show Frank's statement saying " I am against all abortion " , but then he has no problem with his wife getting an abortion cause she doesn't want to lose her figure . Nothing in his statement is " inconsistent " , IMO . If you say Biden is " inconsistent " , you are also saying that about your position ... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You know , if you aren't able to grasp the concept of the inconsistency of saying one is against gay marriage when saying they are for gay rights , I don't know what else to say . It would be different if you didn't think gay marriage should be a right . But you do , so how could his position NOT be inconsistent to you ? To take your abortion example , it would be like someone saying they are for reproductive / abortion rights , but yet being against it being legal for women to get an abortion at an abortion clinic . Frankly , you're grasping at straws at this point .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>BUT THAT'S YOUR POSITION ... If you can't grasp that you are saying YOUR OWN POSITION is inconsistent , I don't know what to say . Yeah . You have no recollection of what my position actually is , do you .

I can't tell you how many people have posted " I don't believe gay marriage is a right " . If they also say " I believe gays should have equal rights " , THERE IS NO CONTRADICTION just cause I BELIEVE ( let me repeat that , I BELIEVE ) that gay marriage is a right . I think Biden's wrong . But HIS VIEW is consistent . On another note , I am just amazed that you think your own position is inconsistent . I honestly had no idea ... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Are you just not reading the thread ???? Apparently not . Let me repeat myself ... " In the sense that saying one supports gay rights but not gay marriage , sure . " I've ALREADY said I KNOW it's inconsistent , but that I DON'T CARE . It's not a pet issue for me . It is for you .

If I could have a private one-on-one with Biden , or if he logged on anonymously to this web-site , I would discuss it with him just the same . Quite frankly , the " he's our candidate " thing is one of the things that takes precedent . See , we don't approach these things as " single issue " type guys . We weigh the " gay marriage opinion " up against the impact of pushing him hard on it a few weeks away from election day , and balance the responding approach accordingly .

 It seems like they are discussing the inconsistency of each other's arguments. S1 is getting annoyed and seems to just be arguing because they are "venting" while S2 is saying that the inconsistency is present and making all arguments invalid without proof. Both S1 and S2 are for gay rights, S2 is stating that S1 isn't being consistent and "admits" to being inconsistent, while S1 is saying they don't care about the inconsistency because of the point they are trying to get across. They bring up Biden and abortion in ways that dont exactly fit the discussion, but just to show the inconsistency in each others opinions. S2 is saying they would handle this same situation with Biden the exact same way because S2 is simply talking about perspective. S1 believes S2 is stating that S1 believes in gay marriage but not gay rights, which seems contradictory to S1's point. This argument does not have a set topic.

S1 believes that Biden saying this is inconsistent, and it should bother S2 because S2 is for gay marriage. S2 does not believe this is an inconsistent statement and attributes Biden's view to S1, making it seem like S1 is calling his own view inconsistent. S1 and S2 begin arguing about the meaning of "inconsistent" and eventually starting fighting. The example of abortion comes up to try and prove inconsistency, but both use it in different ways so it does not stop the argument. S1 believes that S2 should be more concerned with Biden being inconsistent, while S1 is just trying to address the issue as a whole. S2 claims to only have brought up Biden to address the lack of political action due to social pressures. S2 claims that if given the opportunity, they would express the same concerns with Biden on a one on one conversation.

  (S1) states that one who supports gay right but not gay marriage brings an inconsistent problem. (S2) says that he does not sees any inconsistency, and compares it to the issue of abortion and how one can be against such issue for society but for ones position it may be possible. (S1) tells (S2) that it seems like he does not understand the concept of inconsistency. (S1) also says that he hopes that (S2) did not think of gay marriage to be a right. They keep arguing about positions in the matter and who is inconsistent. (S2)  says that many people often times say things such as "I don't believe gay marriage is a right" but they also believe that gay people should have equal rights. He argues that Biden's opinion is consistent and Biden is not lying about what he believes. (S1) says that he know that there is inconsistency but he does not care. (S2) says that people weight the ay marriage opinion issue against politician's weeks before elections and balance the responding approach.

  S1 one believes that it is inconsistent to support gay rights but to be against gay marriage. S1 does not have a problem with such an inconsistency but knowing that S2 supports gay marriage it would make sense that S2 would be bothered by it. S1 doesn't believe that S2 understands the concept of inconsistency. S1 thinks that S2 would be troubled by Biden's position on gay marriage.  it would be like someone saying they are for reproductive / abortion rights , but yet being against it being legal for women to get an abortion at an abortion clinic . 
  
  
  S2 does not see an inconsistency in not supporting gay marriage but being for gay rights. S2 explains that  there is not an inconsistency in being against gay marriage , but for gay rights in every other way . Showing an inconsistency would be like Frank saying he is against abortion rights but has no problem with his wife getting one. Just saying that Frank is inconsistent on abortion issues is not enough to show what is inconsistent. S2 is arguing against the position regardless of who is holding it.

 S1 is not bothered by the inconsistency of one supporting gay rights but not gay marriage, but if one supports gay marriage they would be bothered by it. S2 doesn't see the inconsistency and doesn't understand why S1 keeps calling it that. He says that S1 hasn't shown an inconsistency yet and gives an example of how it is like saying "Frank is inconsistent on the abortion issue", but would be showing inconsistency if is Frank said "I am against all abortion". S1 doesn't know what else to say and that it would be different if S2 didn't think gay marriage would be a right. S2 argues that S1s' position is inconsistent and that S2 can see a person for gay rights and against gay marriage. He thinks Biden is wrong but his view is consistent. S1 says he doesn't care about the inconsistency of one supporting gay rights and not gay marriage. S2 says to push hard on Biden about the "gay marriage opinion" a few weeks away from election day and balance the response.
 
 <br><br><b>Key</b><br> 1-8171_3_2__4_5_7_11_1 <br><b>Dialog</b> <br><b>S1:1-  </b>Because it's all quite clear . Decades of effort from the religious right , conservative republicans , and their like have made gay rights a poisoned topic . It's a tragedy , but saying the right thing on this issue will cost you more votes than it will gain you , everyone knows it , and no one is going to do it . It's politics 101 . The democrats , as a whole , want to do the right thing , but they know that if they say so too loudly they won't be in a position to do anything . They're forced to moderate their public stances so that they can get into positions where they can actually take action . This is of course a generalization , but if you're talking about a political party as a whole that's unavoidable .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So , you're basically saying that Biden was lying through his teeth when he said he doesn't support gay marriage ? It was all just a lie to keep from losing votes ? Interesting . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Possibly , I couldn't say . Certainly as a democrat he gets more benefit of the doubt than I would give a republican when it comes to gay rights , but I haven't plumbed his record enough to say for sure . And let's be honest here , you do not find the idea that a politician might be lying interesting . :)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>What I'd prefer is that the candidates be honest about their views , whether it's popular or unpopular . But even knowing we're talking about political candidates ( who may lie to get votes ) , when a candidate says something is his or her view , I think we have to take them at what they say when they answer a question like that so directly and emphatically . Otherwise , there's little point in asking questions to begin with other than maybe watching the reaction of body language and how they would respond under pressure , and so forth . Political discourse has to operate to where when a candidate gives a given view as HIS or HER view , they are taken at their word that IS their view . " No " can't mean " yes " and so forth . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No , that's too niave an approach . We know politicians are going to tell some lies , I trust that's a given . We , as political consumers , can't simply take politicians at their word . If we want to make informed decisions about candidates we need to develop the skills to make useful judgement calls about what they're saying . We need to figure out how often they lie , what they lie about , how big their lies are . Obviously we shouldn't need to do this , it would be great if we could actually take our politicians at their word . Bad the sad reality is that we can't , not at this stage anyway . In this particular case , if Biden says he doesn't support gay marriage I'm just as likely to think it's because he knows that open support could cost him the White House as any other reason . It's sad that such double speak is needed , I'd love it if enough courageous politicians stood forth and ended the political need for lies , but until that wonderful day I'm not going to be naive and take everything they say at their word , nor am I going to jump up and down and point fingers at every falsehood . I'll try to judge the politicians by their actions , and their lies by their magnitude , scope , and quantity .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I think you are misunderstanding me -- I don't mean I think we should assume they are GOING to always tell the truth -- I mean we should put the expectation on them to be honest . IOW , honesty is what we should demand . If we aren't even going to do that , there's no point in ever asking a political candidate a direct question . Knowing they're going to lie isn't the same as having the expectation on them to be honest . I really don't think it's too much to ask our candidates to say what their views are . You just said yourself " we need to figure out how often they lie , what they lie about , how big their lies are " so , obviously , you believe it's not really good that they are lying . There would be little point in asking them questions if we aren't going to hold to them to SOME level of expectation that they're going to say what they mean . Sure , they lie , but if the words of politicians mean nothing , there's little point in even having political discourse . Political cynicism is no excuse to not put expectations on our candidates to be honest with the American people . <br><br><b>Summaries</b><br>

 This is about politics and whether or not the lie in order to get more votes. S1 believes politicians sometimes may lie as long as its what is the majority, while S2 is saying that S2 is more concerned with the honesty of the candidates rather than whether they are lying or not. S2 says we should expect them to be honest, because that is what we should want from politicians. S1 argues that politicians seem to lie in order to get the position they want or sway people to become popular, while S2 thinks that we should rely on them to make the right decision. S1 seems to think that S2 is making an argument for their belief, but S2 is just trying to be honest and show the other perspective. They argue about politicians lying through discussing when politicians are asked questions and how they answer them. S2 finishes by telling S1 we should not label politicians and expect them to do and say the right, honest thing.

 S1 begins the dialog by attacking conservative republicans for the lack of gay rights in America, and claims democrats have been trying to progress gay rights but are afraid to loose their political position. S2 responds by commenting that Democratic Vice President Joe Biden stated he was against gay marriage. S1 believes he was lying to attract votes. S2 expresses desire for a candidate who stands behind their beliefs regardless of popular opinion, and not lie to get votes. S1 calls S2 naive for believing that lying does not happen in politics today. S1 believes it is the responsibility of the public to decipher political language to know when politicians are lying or not.  S2 believes that the public should demand honesty but not assume it.  There is no point is questioning candidates, if it is known they are going to lie. S2 addresses that S1 also believes that honesty should be demanded because their earlier statements insinuated that they thought this practice was wrong

 (S1) argues that overtime-religious politicians, conservative republicans have made the effort to make gay rights a poison topic. According to his democrats want to do the right thing however, they are force to moderate their opinions for public approval. (S2) says that politicians lie about their opinion to not loose votes. He says that he would prefer if politicians were honest. (S1) says that it is common knowledge that politicians are going to lie because they can not simply say things, they have to be careful for the judgment of other. The particular case of Biden who stated that doesn't support gay marriage. He also states that it might be because Biden did not wanted to risk his support and his position in the White House. (S2)  argues that (S1) is misunderstanding him because according to him people need to put expectation for politicians to be more clear and honest about their opinions. He says that people need to pay close attention to politicians and not excuse politicians cynicism so that the American people can have politicians to be honest.

 S1 is of the opinion that a certain level of dishonesty is understandable and expected in politics. In regard to gay rights, the religious right and conservative republicans have made it a poisoned topic such that politicians won't say the right thing because it will cost them votes. Democrats have had to be moderate on the issue in order to still be in a position to do something. It's too naive to expect to a politician to give their view on matters, and so it is necessary to figure out how often they lie, what they lie about, and how big their lies are.  In this particular case , if Biden says he doesn't support gay marriage S1 is just as likely to think it's because he knows that open support could cost him the White House as any other reason .  
  
  
  S2 believes that as political consumers we should expect honesty of the politicians. It isn't too much to demand honesty. Without that expectation it is pointless in asking a politician a direct question. S2 understands that politicians lie but holds that if words of politicians mean nothing then there is little point in having political discourse. Political cynicism is no excuse to not put expectations on our candidates to be honest with the American people .

 S1 says the topic of gay rights has become a poisoned topic because of efforts of religious right and conservative republicans. It will cost more votes than it will gain. S2 questions if S1 is saying the Biden was lying when he said he doesn't support gay marriage so he could keep from losing votes. S2 prefers political candidates to be honest about their views on topics, whether its popular or not. S2 believes a candidates view should be accepted that it is really their view and S1 says that politicians are going to tell some lies and consumers should not take politicians at their word. S1 believes it is important to figure out how often they lie and how big their lies are. He gives an example of how Biden says he doesn't support gay marriage, it can because he knows that open support could cost him the White House. S2 believes they should put the expectation on them to be honest about what their views are and political cynicism is no excuse to not put expectation on their candidates to be honest.

We benefit from families with adopted children , step children , families with no children at all . No it does not . Prove it will come up , and also prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . Marriage is that now . You're right , it has nothing to do with the Bible . It has everything to do with the slippery slope logical fallacy , which we've discussed in the forum ad nauseum . It only shows that those opposed do not have an argument . You know the prospect of incest and polygamy is much less socially acceptable than gay marriage , so you try to erroneously tie polygamy and incest to gay marriage in people's mind to strike fear in them , and hope their logical reasoning can be replaced by irrational fear .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>a married couple as the head of a home is considered a nuclear family it already has . the question of legality is what this whole issue is about . marriage is a legal instituation , how could legality NOT come up . yes it is whoa ... hold up ... are you saying that only because gay marriage is less unacceptable that incestuous relations , that its ok to grant gay marriage but not sibling marriage ?? if the incestuous society begin to parade and protest , until society accepts them on the level that they accept gays now , what will you say then ? on what grounds should we discriminate against 2 siblings wanting to get married , particularly if they believe they truly love each other , or if they believe that they were born with that attraction ? this is classic hypocracy . if 2 siblings want to love each other in their private lives , how is that any business of yours ? and what does irrational fear have to do with anything ? do you have an irrational fear of an incestuous or polygamous lifestyle ? based on what ? give me one reason why society shouldnt accept an incestuous relation between two consenting adults <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Then what may lead to incest and polygamy is the fact that marriage is a legal institution , is that what you are saying ? If so , these things may come up equally as a result of straight legal marriage or gay legal marriage or interracial legal marriage , or legal inter-faith marriage or legal marriage with legal divorce , etc. It doesn't relate specifically to gay legal marriage at all . I was saying this is how many people attempt an argument against gay marriage , by attempting to incite fear by spouting off a parade of horribles that have nothing to do with the issue of gay marriage . What if straight people are married and winged green monkeys come flying out of everyone's derriere in the future ? What will you do then ? Demonstrate how gay marriage specifically relates to incest and incestuous marriage and polygamy . This is the gay rights forum , not the incest forum .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>thats not what im saying . what may lead to incestuous marriage is if siblings or related people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . and what may lead to polygamous marriage is 3 or more people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . do you see a pattern here ? ooooh .. nice way to snake out of the issue ... let me refresh your memory since you brought it up , what exactly does the social acceptance of any type of " taboo " relationship have to do with their right to be legally married ? is there a certain limit of " tabooness " , and if youre past that limit then no marriage for you ? and what fear are you talking about ? i'm talking about people that love each other and want to tie the knot . how could that possibly strike fear in somebody ? please .... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yes , that's true . Yes , that's true . Are you saying love is the pattern ? Well , love applies to straight marriages as well as gay marriages . Love is not exclusive to gay marriages . If that's the connection , we can just as easily say straight marriage will lead to incestuous marriage and polygamy . You are saying love will cause a slippery slope . It's still fallacious . The issue I brought up was why this fallacy is often used , that is to create fear , because incest and polygamy are indeed considered so taboo . The issue is not the tabooness of anything and everything , but how it is being used to distract from the issue of same-sex marriage , when there isn't a logical , rational argument against same-sex marriage . It's an indication of desperation on the part of some of those who are against same-sex marriage . I have no reason to discuss the level of acceptability or lack thereof of every single thing , before I accept one thing that is different from all those other things . I can deal with that one thing on all of its own merits and shortfalls , without being drawn into a false dilemma , either accept everything or else don't accept one thing , as if those are the only two choices , fallacy .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>gay marriage will change the definition of marriage from " a legal union between a man and a woman " to " a legal union between any parties that love each other " . if its ok for 2 people that love each other and want to tie the knot , then how could incest be a taboo ? based on what ? again with the double standard . gay marriage was considered just as much a taboo as incest or polygamy just a few years ago . being gay emerged from its taboo status through parades , promotional efforts , and , unfortunately , by spreading lies ( i'll deal with that in another thread ) . however , incestuous people didnt go through the process of parading their lifestyle in front of the world and practically begging for approval from society . so incest is still deeper in taboo status than homosexuality . why is it ok to deny incestuous relations the right to marry on the grounds that it is considered taboo , but ok to approve gay marriage on the same grounds ? <br><br><b>Summaries</b><br>

 S1 and S2 are debating whether making gay marriage legal will open opportunities for other "taboos" in our society. S1 believes that in opening this opportunity for gay marriage, the definition of marriage will change and it will allow other issues like incest and polygamy to become legal. S2 accuses S1 of hypocracy. In a sense, they believe gay marriage will have a sort of domino effect for other issues. S1 is arguing that using these other issues to be evidence for why gay-marriage shouldn't be allowed is not a valid argument. Then S1 goes on to say that this tactic is used to instill fear to those who do not support those other issues. S1 understands the other issues, but doesn't see the relationship between those and that of same-sex marriage. S2 keeps arguing that it shouldnt be different figuring out whether one can approve gay marriage but not incest since they believe the two to be somewhat related.

  S1 and S2 discuss same-sex marriage. S1 is for gay marriage, and opens the discussion by showing logical fallacies used by the opposition to deter people from believing gay marriage is an extension of equal rights.  S1 believes that modern families are not traditional families and are often better off for it. S1 specifically points out the comparison of gay marriage to incest or polygamy. S1 says this is a scare tactic to turn people away. S2 believes that homosexuality, incest, and polygamy are all related because they are all taboos of society. S2 wants to draw the line as is so the definition of marriage does not change. If it does change then there would be no limit to who could marry.  S1 explains that love is present in all marriage so the claims made by S2 about gay marriage leading to incest, could be used for straight marriage as well. S2 attacks S1 and thinks that if the other parties mentioned went and paraded their lifestyle then they would also have an equal opportunity to make their marriage a social issue.

 (S1) begins talking about how we benefit from what is considered common, such as a nuclear family and how it is composed. He also says that it's right it has nothing to do with the bible however; it has everything to do with slippery slop logical fallacy. Then, gives the example of how incest and polygamy is less socially accepted in comparison to gay marriage. And so, it rebuttals the argument using both issues with equal weight because it scares some people away who might not have much knowledge about the topics.  (S2) states that a married couple is considered a nuclear family and that marriage is a legal institution. (S2) poses the question of weather it's acceptable for gay marriage to be accepted but not the other because they are less popular and if so why? (S1) answers that those issues do not relate specifically to gay legal marriage and that many attempt to use those issues similarly to argue against gay marriage.  (S2) brings up the question of what is socially accepted and the types of taboo relationship and legality. (S1) says that love is not exceptionally for gay people but also others. Also that taboos are constructed on the basis of peoples reasoning, indications and practices. (S2) keeps arguing why is anestrous taboo and not gay marriage?

 S1 thinks that we don't just benefit from what is often considered the common , nuclear family . We benefit from families with adopted children , step children , families with no children at all . S1 believes that marriage has nothing to do with the bible. Then what may lead to incest and polygamy doesn't relate specifically to gay legal marriage at all. S1 is trying to show that people who are against gay marriage try to dissuade others by attempting to incite fear by spouting off a parade of horribles that have nothing to do with the issue of gay marriage . S1 holds that love applies to straight marriages as well as gay marriages and that love is not exclusive to gay marriages. It is fallacious to believe that love will lead to a slippery slope. Those against gay marriage use logical fallacies.
  
  
  S2 does not see the logic in bringing up sibling marriages and is curious to know how S1 would respond to such movements. S2 does not believe that what people do in their private lives is anyone else's business. What may lead to incestuous marriage is if siblings or related people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage. What may lead to polygamous marriage is 3 or more people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . Gay marriage was considered just as much a taboo as incest or polygamy just a few years ago. S2 does not understand why it is  ok to deny incestuous relations the right to marry on the grounds that it is considered taboo , but ok to approve gay marriage on the same grounds.

Marriage has nothing to do with the bible and everything to do with the slippery slope logical fallacy. S2 believes a married couple as the head of a home is considered a nuclear family because is already that the question of legality. He questions S1 if he is trying to say because gay marriage is less acceptable than incestuous relations that it is okay to grant gay marriage but not sibling marriage. According to S1, incest and polygamy doesn't relate specifically to gay legal marriage. S2 questions to what exactly does the social acceptance of any type of "taboo" relationship have to do with their right to be legally married. S2 believes  that gay marriage will change the definition of marriage from "a legal union between man and woman" to "a legal union between any parties that love each other". He poses the question if it is okay for two people to tie the knot then how could incest be  taboo.

Now if you'd linked someone in the Republican leadership saying those things , you might have something , but you didn't . Paul Cameron is a psychologist that has gone over the top at times with some of the things he's said about gays and has paid a price for it . He's a frequent target of the gay pride movement for demonization and because he didn't tow the line with the APA's political stances , they distanced themselves from him .

This is not about Paul Cameron no matter how much you'd love to change the subject , it's about Matt's ridiculous generalizations and comments . Oh , and you need to get up with the times -- no national political party has used Cameron's information in a serious way in a long time .

 This seems to be an argument about gay rights and generalizing the political beliefs of people. According to S1, S2 talks about Paul Cameron and makes it seem as if he is the voice of the Republicans. S1 argues that it is not the case and one person who sides with a specific party doesn't represent the party. S1 uses John Lennon as an example of this not being a proper way to generalize political views of parties, in his case the Democratic party. S1 accuses S2 of making an assertion including the Republicans creating another Holocaust, because of the generalization that S2 made. S2 believes that Paul Cameron's views are cited and used in many cases against gay rights because most people do share the same views, which S1 thinks otherwise. S2 says that most attacks on gay rights have cited Paul Cameron, even within the US Senate, showing that he has a strong opinion in the Republican party, or at least it seems so.

  S1 and S2 enter a discussion about gay rights, but more specifically on the claims made by a certain Republican Party member: Paul Cameron. S1 is angered that S2 is making wide generalization about the Republican Party, and agrees that Cameron is eccentric party member. S2 believes that since Republican Party members often use Cameron as citation for research and therefore most share his views that gays are bad for the world and must be exterminated, like the Jews in the Holocaust.  S1 thinks S2 is making a generalization on the entire party's based off one person. S2 thinks this unfair because Cameron is not apart of the Republican Leadership, and that the views of Cameron are outdated with the views of Republicans today.  S1 compares this to quoting singer John Lennon against religion and attributing it to the entire Democratic Party. S2 responds by connecting Cameron with George W. Bush, and believes that if a party constantly uses the research of single person, then they must share the beliefs of that person.

 (S1) starts talking about how it's ridiculous to think that republicans would send gays to concentration camps like the Germans practiced in the Holocaust.  He talks about Paul Cameron a psychologist having nothing to do with politician's ideas or decisions. He tries to assert that republicans do not cite or reference Paul because he is not a reliable source. However,(S2) argues that Paul is frequently referenced as an expert on the issue of gay marriage and rights. He talks about the moral behind Paul's "research" and how it's fraudulent.(S1) then asks (S2) to stay on point and not divert the conversation. He also states that someone who may not be republican may hate gays and that Republicans platform or party leadership does not has to do with Paul's views.(S2) says that Paul's "research" is present in the debate over gay marriage.(S2) also says that Paul has been cited in virtually every legal brief filed opposing gay marriage.(S1) says that (S2) is generalizing while (S2) talks about family values.

S1 believes that S2 is making ridiculous generalizations.
  
  
  S2 believes that S1 is defending Paul Cameron and states that he is the single most frequently quoted " expert " cited by the GOP in ALL their attempts to limit the rights of gay people . Paul Cameron's research is cited in virtually every single attack on gay people in state after state after state legislature . It was presented in the " debate " about same-sex marriage in the U.S. friggin ' Senate . His name appears in the citations of virtually every legal brief filed by opponents of same-sex marriage . S2 is surprised that reasonable people talk about Paul Cameron. S2 finds it laughable to try to defend the GOP when one of their admittedly most effective propaganda campaigns is to rally the " family-values " crowd against gay rights .

 S1 is upset with Matt about making an assertion that Republicans would send gays to concentration camps and about a statement by psychologist Paul Cameron. Instead he should have linked someone in the Republican leadership saying those things. Paul Cameron is a frequent target of gay pride movement for demonization. S2 says that Paul Cameron is the most frequently quoted "expert" cited by GOP in all their attempts to limit the rights of gay people. S1 says the point is that Matt commented that someone who may not even be a republican hates gays, and that republicans hate gays. He says it's not about Paul Cameron but about Matt's ridiculous comments and that no republican in leadership would call for the extermination of gays. S2 argues that Paul Cameron's research is cited in almost every single attack on gay people in state after state legislature. S1 says to S2 that he is making a ridiculous generalization while S2 replies that he said S1 is probably right to assume that some people were anti-religion.

 S1 and S2 are debating the issue of freedom of speech and gay rights. S1 is against gay rights and believes they earned their freedom of speech through serving in the military. S2 believes everyone has the freedom of speech and is against speaking out towards other kinds of people. S1 is very rude and constantly being immature towards S2. S2 states that we are granted freedom of speech by the constitution, and S1 responds with immature remarks and questions. S2 points out that S1 has no evidence of any sort for his arguments and that believing in the bible should not be a reason to dictate everyone else's rights. Also, S2 adds that he doesn't need to prove his beliefs the same way S1 shouldn't dictate his beliefs. S1 seems to be ignorant to the actual context of the conversation while S2 is in belief that S1 shouldn't use his beliefs to dictate the rights of other individuals.

  S1 and S2 enter a discussion on gay rights and religion impact of legislation. S1 served in the military and they believed they have earned their right to have freedom of speech. S2 points out that gays should be able to do the same but are unable to due to prejudice due to policies that keep gay people from being open about their sexuality. S2 explains to S1 that the right to freedom of speech is guaranteed by the Constitution and gay are not being protected.  S1 is fine with gay serving in the military as long as they stay in closet or they should be kicked out. S2 argues that it is unfair to have laws based on religious text that does serve as everyone's religious text.  S1 responds angrily and with homosexual slurs, and requests that S2 take his comments up with Obama. S2 explains his goal is too preach to the public and not to any specific person.  S1 believes S2 is being prejudice against religious-minded people.

  S2 finds it amusing that S1 believes that he fought for the right of free speech but that S1 does not believe that gay people should have it. S2 points out that free speech is inherently protected through the constitution. S2 finds that gay people under S1's view do not have freedom of speech because if gay people say the wrong thing then they get kicked out.The constitution applies to all Americans , even the gays .

S2 also says S1 didn't actually fight for his freedom of speech but was guaranteed it by the constitution which applies to all Americans including gays. S2 questions S1 to why there should be consequences on earth because S1 believes it is wrong according to his religious book. S2 tells S1 that he has no evidence of what he claims but asks S2 why all Americans should believe S1's book. S2 says the power of the government comes from the people and his fight is again bigots who feels that they can use their personal beliefs to dictate what other may or may not do. S1 questions S2 as to who is he to decide what religious-minded people can and cannot do and says S2's personal bigotry is getting to him.

 This debate is about the 9th and how the federal constitution applies to marriage. S1 and S2 begin by talking about trolling and potentially starting a new debate on abortion, which doesn't really have a lot of purpose in this conversation. S2 says that in saying people who want to get rid of gay marriage may have wanted to prevent inter-racial and inter religious marriage. S2 states that Maine's vote on gay marriage was an opinion on gay marriage, rather than the 9th being how the Federal Constitution applies to gay marriage. S2 also says that Bowers Justice Stevens doesn't have the evidence to withstand his analysis. They also bring up Lawrence v. Texas and S2 states that even when majority wants a law it isn't enough for the constitution challenge of the law. S2 goes back to saying how S1's arguments are flawed and that its too repetitive for this conversation, because S1 hasn't disproved anything. They go back to talking trash to each other and they end the conversation.

 S1 and S2 are in unfriendly argument about gay marriage. The argument originally starts in a tangent of Abortion.  S2 thinks that S1 is trolling the thread and briefly comment on abortion playing the devil advocate to shows the misuse of logic is S1's thinking for issues in gay marriage. S1 continues to antagonize S2. S2 continues to discuss the necessity of drawing boundaries in reason and the importance staying on track. S2 says they should use familiar comparison of attacks on inter-racial marriage where if you are against interracial marriage, you are for slavery,  to show his support of gay marriage, just to show S1that type of discourse is not logically accurate. S1 brings the "9th" from Maine and "Prop 8" from California as example of states that have showed that their majority was against gay marriage, but yet people in those states are still trying to get them overturned. S2 compliments S1 for clever banter. S2 ends the discussion by accusing S1 of repeating his points, which pertain to two separate issues.

(S2) talks about State's majority has traditionally seen an issue as immoral it is not enough to prohibit the practice and that intimate relationships are no one else's concern and it is a liberty by due process.

 This is about the use of arguments of violence towards gay-marriage. S1 starts off saying there is a difference between being anti-gay and someone condoning violence against gay people. S2 talks about how violence is used to make people feel threatened to feel a certain way about a topic or debate. S2 used the example of kids being taught about gay marriage in school as a threat. S2 also mentions someone named Archie who posts include a variety of slurs towards gay people. S1 brushes on the topic, but goes off track from the topic quite a bit. These two people start referring to each others "attacks" on each other towards the end. S1 says they were referring to namecalling and violence from the original post that was opposing gay rights. These two aren't really in opposite positions/beliefs, but they are more trying to discuss the ways they argue for or against gay marriage and how it may be portrayed by others.

S1 thinks violence towards gays is used as launching point for gays to preach gay rights.  S2 makes reference other poster and homophobic slurs that be frequently used on the thread. S2 believes that violence towards gay stem from slanderous representations of gays, and produces a toxic environment where people will act in violence out of fear.  S1 is once again gets angered by the generalizations used by S2, because it does not represent his point.  S2 is happy S1 is no loner attacking him. S1 believes he was only responding to the attacks by S2.  S2 becomes angry with S1 for avoiding the main topic at hand.  The discussion diverges into S2 quoting previous posters and showing hateful speech.  S2 believes this dehumanizing talk in responsible for hate against gays.

(S1) says that there is an anti-gay rhetoric and inflated statements to scare people.

S2 says that on Archie's post that Archie regularly denigrates gays with a variety of slurs. S1 finds it funny that the whole violence thing gets used as a means-to-an-end tool by those who argue against religious people on this. People shouldn't have to stop standing up for their principles just because of other people. S2 says telling people that gay marriage will makes their kids have to be taught about gay marriage is a threat, as well as telling people that gay marriage will require churches to have to perform gay marriages. S2 thinks S1 is ignoring him but S1 says he is not rather S2's tone has changed. S1 says name calling and violence were the things Jason conflated with opposing gay marriage. S2 asks S1 to quote exactly what he said because he thinks Jason did no such thing. 
 
 <br><br><b>Key</b><br> 1-6331_5_4__7_9_12_13_15_20_32_34_37_38_1 <br><b>Dialog</b> <br><b>S1:1-  </b>Any two adults can run the household , one can make the decision if the other is incapacitated , one inherits when the other dies , etc etc. That parallel does not carry over to group marriages . When one dies , who inherits ? If one is incapacitied , who decides what the treatment should be ? Basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two , so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task , and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious . If we're talking about legal recognition , and we are ( right ? ) , then the cases are wildly different . Our marriage laws , for better or worse , are set up on the assumption of two adults running a household . They also assume man and wife , true , but don't actually depend on that . But the dependence on there being two people is embedded in the laws ; changing that is a huge project .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yes , but gays would also want laws changed to accomodate THEIR form of marriage as well . The fact that one requires less change than the other shouldn't matter , should it ? Should having to do more reworking of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality ? It seems to me your argument boils down to " polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it . " Yeah -- such is the price for marriage equality . Let's face it -- if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for opposite-sex couples which comprise most relationships , they could pull it off -- polygamy , gays , letting 17 year olds marry , etc. All those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed . Means could be set up to determine inheritance , for example . Laws can be worded to do it . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>See , this is why we try to avoid this debate . Those who oppose gay marriage inevitably put their own spin on it and drag it to silly conclusion . Here we see what gays really want turned into " make marriage an open-ended institution of equality " , which then means gay , poly , and 17 year olds in this case . Jyoshu stopped there , but it's not uncommon for it then to go to children , cousins , dogs , whatever . This issue is not " let's let everyone do anything they like " , that's just the common reframing we see whenever poly relations are brought up while disscusing gay marriage . It happens all the time , it gets old , and that's why people who have gone through it a bunch of times tend to aviod the whole thing .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It happens because there's no way to avoid logical conclusions . Believe it or not , cultural and legal precedent is a very real thing . The events in the article exemplify this . If you argue to broaden marriage ( which you are ) , then this is what you have to deal with . As you said , I DID stop with polygamy , gay , and barely lowering the age of consent , so why are YOU bringing up all the other examples like " children , cousins dogs , " or whatever , as if you were ready to pounce on that ? You're arguing against degrees that I didn't even say , or that NO one said . Now , do you have any response to my point that your argument boils down to nothing more than " polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it " , or are you just going to avoid it by getting sidetracked by the fact you don't like that we're even talking about this ? Again , society can deal with issues like polygamy if they really want to . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Sure there is . You can start with an erroneous assumption , like you did , and then arrive at an illogical conclusion , like you did . Why don't you read the exchanges between me and Phyllis ; I think most of your issues will be addressed that way .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Do you feel that opening marriage to gay couples is not a case of broadening marriage ? How is that an erroneous assumption ? Sure , but I asked you some specific questions that you seem to be avoiding . In your exchange with Phyllis I may comment on matters I disagree with . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Listen to yourself ! We start with " gays want to get married " , you change it to " make marriage an open-ended institution of equality " , and now you segue over to " broadening marriage " . Your erroneous assumption is your statement of what gays are trying to accomplish . Until you stop trying to change what gays really want into something that you can argue against more easily all your arguments will be based on erroneous assumptions . Actually , I did address them . While debating with Phyllis . Naturally . And naturally I may ignore them if I think they are diversions .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>What gays are trying or not trying ( in terms of intent ) is not the issue . What is the crux here is that marriage would be broadened . It's not rocket science . You're moving the boundaries of what constitutes a marriage to include MORE than opposite-sex couples . Very straightforward . I know you don't like it phrased that way , but that's what it is . You can't take a phrase like ' gays want to get married " without looking at the overall implications . In terms of legal rights , I don't see why it would be any different . Equality in marriage is equality in marriage regardless of the cultural motivation -- religious , being in love with more than one person , or simply just for the hell of it . For that matter , the argument could be made that opposite-sex marriage between 2 people is largely a religious construct ! <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I'll try to explain this to you one more time . The stated purpose of gays is quite relevent if you are trying to argue against it . Gays want to get married . One side effect of that is that some people will see the scope of marriage broadened . Gays are not , in and of itself , trying to broaden marriage . They did not wake up one day and say " let's try to broaden the scope of marriage today , that'll be fun ! " Your arguments run along the lines of " If you want to braoden marriage , than you must excpet it broadening in all these other ways " and that's why your rephrasing doesn't work . Broadening marriage isn't the goal , it's a side effect , and since it isn't the goal we don't have to accept all these other things you claim would be the result if they were trying to broaden marriage . To recap , your arguments are based on your assumption that gays want to broaden marriage , that that is their ulitmate goal , the pinnacle of the cause . Gays getting married to you seems to be the means to that end . That is , of course , backwards , and so your sematic based arguments fail .<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Kronos , I just told you I am not dealing here with what gays are trying / not trying to do in terms of intent , yet you are are arguing as if I never even said that . I am not arguing what gays have as intent . I completely understand what you are saying . My point here is based on the effect of their intents , whatever that intent is . There is simply no way to get around the fact that if you change marriage to include other that opposite-sex couples ( to ANY number of other possibilities -- even ONE ) , you are broadening marriage . Whether or not gays set out out to do this in terms of a goal is irrelevant . You are attacking some point about intent that I haven't made -- I'm talking about the effect here . To latch onto some straw man of " intent " is to completely miss the point . <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I'm not ignoring this post , I'm simply choosing not to respond because it's a pointless distraction in an otherwise interesing thread . If you want to start another thread on this theme I'll explain there how wrong you are .<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Well , you're the one that's taking issue and making it a distraction ! <br><br><b>Summaries</b><br>

 S1: Opposers to gay marriage often jump to conclusions about who can get married -why not cousins, group marriages, children, dogs? Polygamous marriage raises legal concerns that are not currently covered in traditional marriage laws, for example. The goal of gay marriage supporters is to be able to get married - not to broaden marriage. Broadened marriage is a side effect of legal gay marriage.
 
 S2: Gay marriage supporters want marriage laws changed to accommodate gay marriage. Broadened marriage could change the current traditional marriage laws. Polygamy, for example, would require more marriage laws changed than gay marriage would, as more people are involved. But if enough people wanted legal polygamous marriage, the laws would be passed. Marriage would be broadened if gay marriage is made legal, whether that is the goal of gay marriage or not.

 Two people are discussing gay marriage and its possible consequences.  S1 contends that our current marriage benefit laws are set up for two adults running a household, so recognising group marriages is a huge task. He points out that even though its for one man and wife, that is not a necessity and would be a much easier task than allowing group marriages.  He argues that the purpose of what gays are trying to do is to get married, and a side effect is that people will see it as the scope of marriage being broadened.  But, broadening marriage to include polygamy and other types of marriages is a side effect that doesn't need to be accepted.  S2 contends that cultural and legal precedent is very real, and that intent is irrelevant.  This is because by seeking gay marriage, the boundaries of what defines marriage is widening to include more than opposite-sex couples and because that, gays are broadening marriage, which inevitably leads to broadening in the other areas.

 S1 believes changing the law to outline group marriages would be a tedious task.  S1 believes transforming to open ended would open the door for other issues such as children being allowed to marry.  S1 believes those who practice other types of unions are using same sex marriage to open the door for other types of unions to be accepted and recognized as well. S1 believes this is the reason most people do not want to broach the subject of polygamist unions advising the goes is not to broaden marriage.
 
 S2 feels laws will need to be changed to tailor to same sex marriages and the same courtesy should be extended to polygamous marriage.  S2 argues that society can deal with the issue of polygamy without opening the flood gates to include groups such as children, family members, and animals. S2 argues if the institution of marriage is to be changed to include same sex couples, there is no choice but to also face the subject of other types of unions as well.

 S1 (Kronos) and S2 (Jyoshu) are discussing the fact that there are other groups besides the gay community who may want marriage equality rights, such as polygamy advocates or 17 year olds.  Jyoshu sees the changes in law that would be required as an attack on social and legal precedent that can get out of control or be difficult to implement.  Kronos complains that this is a frequent tactic of anti-gay marriage advocates who unfairly claim  that gays want to "make marriage an open ended institution."  Jyoshu notes that whatever the intent, the result is the kind of change the anti-gay advocates warn against.  Kronos asserts that specific laws could accommodate specific groups.  He also argues that the motivation of gays who wish to marry is sincere and the same as the motivation behind opposite sex marriages, and therefore the broadening of marriage is a side effect and not the goal.  Jyoshu says she understands but complains that gay marriage would open the door to further broadening of marriage.

 S1 argues that group marriages would not make sense under current marriage laws, as they only account for two individuals in a legal marriage. They state that opponents of homosexual marriage tend to argue that a change to marriage law would make it too open ended. This person does not believe that to be true, and argues that homosexuals are not trying to broaden the scope of marriage, but only change the law to be inclusive of themselves. They believe that bringing up hypothetical arguments to the contrary is a distraction.
 S2 argues that an effect of homosexuals being allowed to legally marry would lead to even more changes to marriage laws that would include more than simply homosexual relationships. This person believes that allowing homosexual marriage is a case that broadens marriage and if allowed, can open basis for future arguments to broaden the law further. They firmly believe that marriage as an institution is between a heterosexual male and female and that changing that in any way gives legal grounds to continue changing it.

I don't think they saw it the same way they would see black people . They didn't even realize that ' homosexuality ' was any sort of innate thing . It was entirely behavioral to them . I tend to agree with the court , even given what you've said . I doubt for 1909 it was about prejudice and bigotry -- they genuinely felt it was wrong . The concept of gay marriage was completely foreign and unknown in 1909 . It wasn't even something they conceived of . I think the court is saying that they couldn't have been prejudiced against something they didn't even know of or conceive of .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Hogwash . It was once entirely moral to believe certain races were inferior , and that women had fewer rights than men . Treating the races and women as equal was not something even thought of by many .

It's a popular misconstruing of morality and history by proponents of modern ' rights ' movements , but it's not true . There's little historical backing to the idea that people believed oppressing black people was a right thing to do , as in , doing good . There were times they used an argument where religion was wrongly used to justify their behavior , but that's a different matter . If you firmly believe otherwise , I'd challenge you to show where people thought oppressing blacks was an example if doing good . The same goes for misogyny . Furthermore , it's beside the point anyway . We're talking about homosexuality . In 1909 , the only thing they really understood about the issue at hand was that some people engaged in sexual relations with people of their own gender . There were no articles about " homosexuality " as a trait , and certainly none about genetic causes . It was understood entirely from a behavioral standpoint , and therefore a moral standpoint . So it's not hogwash at all -- they really did view gay sex as immoral . If you don't think so , then you have a very poor grasp on history in this case .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This kind of morality is based on nothing but ignorance ( which you admit ) and prejudice . What kind of a basis is that for a so-called moral code ? So what if it involves behaviour ?

This does not mean people could not be prejudiced about the way gay people live .

With that caveat , yes you are certainly free to advocate whatever you want to be morally wrong . ( And unlike the way some in your movement do , I won't call you a " bigot " for doing so ! ) It may have been based on " ignorance " , but I reject the notion it was based on prejudice ( and therefore I tend to agree with the 6 - 0 view of the justices here ) . The 1909 society had too little understanding of gay people to be prejudiced over in the first place . Remember , homosexuality was not understood as a state of being at that time . The term itself had not been around long and was not known to most people . And even to those it was known to , it was not known as a state of being . And there certainly was no social identity among gay people as a group -- how could prejudice have existed if there was nothing ( from their perspective ) to be prejudiced toward ?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Right .

People would widely and hatefully use the term " sodomite " to refer to gays . Before that the term was " molly " . Clearly there was an identity they were prejudiced towards . They were rounding up gays in areas they were known to attend , and putting them in prison . Read up on the trial of Oscar Wilde . Gays may have been forced underground , to a greater extent , but that does not mean they were not thought of . Gays were just not thought of in a nice way .

No , here's where you don't get it -- it's not that " gays " ( there was no concept of that ) were purposely kept out of of everything , it's that people who had sodomy relationships were kept out of everything , because sodomy was viewed as wrong .

 S1: In 1909, being homosexual was morally wrong, and people could be prejudiced about something that they did not recognize as innate. There was little historical evidence to prove that people in 1909 believed that it was "right" or "good" to oppress black people or women, and this sentiment extend to homosexuals. In 1909, people knew that gay sex occurred and they understood its occurrence to be entirely behavioral, and therefore, immoral. Homosexuality was not understood as a social identity back then, so there was no "gay lifestyle" to be prejudiced against. Sodomy was criminalized, not being gay.
 
 S2: There was prejudice against gays in 1909 just as there is now. The immorality of homosexuality in 1909 is based on ignorance. As long as gay people "lived straight", they could be as sexually non-normative as they wanted to be. There were terms for gay men back then, like sodomite and molly, so there was a clear identity for people to be prejudiced against. Men who "acted gay" were punished for it in 1909.

 Two people are discussing a the perception of homosexuality in 1909.  S1 makes the argument that in 1909, homosexuality was viewed from a moral standpoint instead of being about prejudice and bigotry, since they didn't realize that homosexuality was a state of being and thought it was purely behavioral.  S2 contends that it was once moral to have racial and gender inequality based on prejudice, so prejudice against gays was around even then.  S1 retorts  by stating that there's little historical backing to the idea that racism or misogyny was doing good, and the issue in 1909 was understood behaviorally and therefore morally.  He states that 1909 society had to little understanding of homosexuality to be prejudiced.  To contradict, S2 states that people hatefully used the term "Sodomite" to refer to gays, were put in prison and kept out of everything in Society.  S1 rebuts by stating that it is because Sodomy wasn't approved, not because they were gay, as there was no social identity.

 S1 sides with the court's argument that in 1909 there was no prejudice toward gays as they didn't know what this was at that time and this makes it a moral standpoint, not a prejudice against.  S1 feels S2 does not have a firm grasp of historical facts due to the points made.  S1 rejects the point of gays having been forced to conform to society and cites that hetero-society did not believe in sodomy and due to this would not support relationships between two males.
 
 S2 compares the treatment of homosexuals in that era with the oppression of the black race and the belief women were a lesser gender.  S2 believes the morality of the era was based on ignorance and prejudice as it is today. S2 advises the moral system used in that era was prejudice based on ignorance and society is plagued by the same ignorance and non-morals. S2 also believes gays were not thought of as human.  Free to be gay as long as they weren't openly gay.

 S1 and S2 are discussing society's attitude toward homosexuality in 1909 in reaction to a court case addressing a 1909 issue.  It is not clear when the opinion was issued, but S2 suggests that the unanimous opinion of 6 judges implies that a ruling in 1909 against homosexuality was not based on prejudice because the act of homosexuality was viewed more as a crime rather than membership in a group.  S1 asserts that there have always been homosexuals and prejudice against them, citing Oscar Wilde for example.  S2 argues that genetic causes were not considered at the time, that homosexuality was deemed misbehavior, and in the past were repressed enough to not constitute a known community which could be discriminated against.  S1 likens historical discrimination against the gay community to historical discrimination against blacks with slavery and women with misogyny.  S2 differentiates the latter two by arguing that nobody openly supported slavery or misogyny as a good and moral thing, whereas the prosecution of sodomy was considered a routine legal proceeding.

 S1 believes that in 1909, the stance against homosexuality was based on a moral obligation and not prejudice because homosexuality at that time was viewed as behavioral and not genetic. This person parallels the treatment of women and blacks during that time period and state that it was viewed, back then, as morally right. They argue that since most people viewed homosexuality as a behavior and not a state of being in 1909, it couldn't have been prejudiced. This person does not believe that there was a social identity among homosexuals in 1909 because society viewed it as morally wrong.
 S2 argues against the idea that ignorance is a reasonable excuse for prejudice. This person also uses the parallel of treatment of blacks and women, but argues that morality was an excuse to hide the prejudice. They argue that ignorance is what led to a distinct prejudice towards certain lifestyles and people, and argues against the idea that there wasn't a social identity for homosexuals in 1909 when there was obvious disapproval aimed in their direction.

I know of no moral system that condones hurting others when said harm isn't preventing some other harm , so morals are out .

 S1: Religion is a good tool to guide one's own actions, but not for telling others how to live. People have been prejudiced against homosexuals for a long time. Moral or religious prejudice is still prejudice. A person can claim a moral or religious stance without having one. You cannot justify an anti-gay agenda on morals or religion. An anti-gay stance on the grounds of religious belief is prejudice. Prejudice based on religious belief implies that a religious person's acts of prejudice could have a negative impact on homosexuals, because they believe that being gay is morally reprehensible. 
  
 S2: Prejudice is a fact of human existence. Christianity is a moral system. When people claim religion in morals, they abandon that moral system. It is religious belief - not prejudice - that makes one take an anti-gay stance. The Bible says that homosexuality is wrong, so if you believe in the Bible as your moral canon, then you believe that homosexuality is wrong as well.

 Two people are discussing gay marriage.  S1 believes that the anti-gay agenda is based on prejudice, and that simply calling something moral or religious does not mean it can't be prejudice at the same time.  He contends that people who justify the anti-gay agenda claim a moral or religious stance without having one. He also states that he has never seen someone justify an anti-gay agenda based solely on morals or religion. S2 retorts by stating that when people claim religion in doing prejudice they are actually abandoning their morals, and prejudice is not what's behind people's opposition to gays being in romantic relationships.  He states that the simple reason is because it's Biblical; the Bible says it shouldn't be done so it shouldn't be done.  S2 then points out that if that is someone's belief then that's fine, but banning someone else from doing it due to that belief is imposing their views on others, which is wrong.

 S1 believes it is prejudice as opposed to religious or moral beliefs which fuel the anti-gay agenda; advising a moral-bases system does not allow for the intentional targeting of another and also religion could be cited but is not based upon dictating how another should live.  S1 believes all religious based arguments regarding gay issues eventually circle around to prejudice and invites S2 to support the religious argument without this happening.  S1 advises there is no issue with people who do not try to push their views on others.
 
 S2 concedes religion is not to blame in and of itself and eludes to the point that often times people who are claiming a religious or moral reason for their actions are doing so after having gone against the premise on which their belief is based.  S2 also advises he/she is against same sex relationships because the Bible says it's wrong but does not impose his/her beliefs on others and is not prejudice.  S2 refuses to give the summary of their religious argument.

 S1 and S2 are discussing anti-gay bias and the nature of prejudice versus valid religious beliefs.  S1 believes it is prejudicial to hold anti-gay opinions, whether based on religious values or otherwise, and use them to impose ones views on another. S2 agrees that religious belief can be improperly used as the pretext for acts of prejudice against the gay community, but proposes that only people who are lying about having religious values against homosexuality should be accused of being prejudiced.  S2 asserts vaguely that her belief that "Christ is a resurrected being" somehow absolves her of prejudice in being generally opposed to homosexuality.  S1 seems inclined to grant her leeway based on such a religious objection, but requests more specifics as to why a Christian must oppose homosexuality and admonishes S1 not to actively agitate against the gay community or advocate for public policies which are discriminatory.  S1 is opposed to groups such as "Focus on the Family" (may be a misnomer) who attempt to impose their views on others.

This person believes that anti-homosexual sentiments are based on prejudice and that those who oppose homosexual lifestyles use religion and morals as an excuse to say that they aren't actually prejudiced. This person voices a displeasure in those who would press their own personal biases upon others, especially when using morals or religion as reasons for doing so.
 S2 believes that people can have a strong moral or religious belief and not be prejudiced. This person does not approve of a homosexual lifestyle and argues that it is not because of prejudice but because of his or her personal religious beliefs. He or she, however, states that they have no desire to impose such beliefs on anyone else. This person believes that what they personally believe is not what everyone else does, and agrees that people can falsely claim a moral or religious opposition to homosexual lifestyles.

 S1: Legally, it is complicated to legalize gay marriage in all states, as DOMA is in place and states have chosen not to recognize other state's marriages for decades.  Attempts abide by the FFC clause to in respect to marriage (even before DOMA) require such lengthy legal arguments that they are rendered prohibitive. The choice of law doctrine must be considered and DOMA could be found to be unconstitutional by vote of the SCOTUS. How will states use the choice of law doctrine so that the FFC clause does not apply? 
 
 S2: If Congress removes DOMA, a vote for legal gay marriage will pass quickly, and certain justices of SCOTUS already approve of gay marriage. DOMA has yet to be declared unconstitutional because there has yet to be a case made to challenge DOMA in the courts, so it has not been decided upon by SCOTUS. The choice of law doctrine trumps the FFC clause in cases of marriage contract and there is a current tradition of respecting other states marriage licenses for

 Two people are discussing gay marriage.  S1 states that in the next 20 years the wave of gay marriage legalization will be over, to which S2 states that if Congress removes the Defense of Marriage Act, the full faith and credit clause is a clear constitutional mandate.  S1 rebuts saying that even without the federal DOMA, the choice of law doctrine means that states can choose not to recognize gay marriage, or even be forced to recognize another state's gay marriage.  He also states that the full faith and credit clause has never been used in that way, and due to the lengthy legal argument involved it is unlikely to be used.  To contradict this, S2 states that each Justice will vote to side with gay marriage, and there is a current tradition of one state respecting another's marriage license when it comes to heteros, a tradition that will be kept if gay marriage laws are passed.

 ----------
 S1 believes New England and New York will pass gay marriage and the West Coast will as well; however, S1 also believes the influx of states to recognize the unions will drop off for as many as 30 years.  S1 also believes the removal of DOMA will not effect the outcome nationally advising each state has a right to pass or not pass in the state as well as the fact one state does not have to recognize another state's laws; meaning, just because someone is married in New York does not mean Pennsylvania would have to recognize that marriage. S1 feels courts will rely upon choice of law doctrine for guidance.
 
 S2 does not agree with this information and believes if DOMA is removed gay marriage will be passed nation wide.  S2 also feels the majority of Justices will vote pro gay marriage should DOMA be removed from the equation.  Also, there is a belief each state will eventually recognize the unions entered into in states which do allow gay marriage.

 S1 and S2 are pondering the future of gay marriage laws in the United States.  S1 posits that States on the East and West Coasts will have gay marriage laws, but that mosts states will be able to prevent them with laws of their own which define marriage as between a man and a woman.  S2 is optimistic that the Supreme Court will find State laws that ban gay marriage unconstitutional if Congress acts to remove DOMA [Defense of Marriage Act].  S1 questions why the Court doesn't find DOMA unconstitutional, to which S2 asserts it has not had the opportunity to do so yet.  S2 also argues that choice of law rules in the various States will result in gay marriages not being recognized in States where there is no gay marriage, and that States have historically already done so on that basis.  He further asserts that resort to choice of law rules means that the FFC [Full Faith and Credit Clause] of the Constitution is not addressed in this context.

 S1 believes that new England and New York will have gay marriage within the next few years and that the west coast might come soon after. They argue that after this time period, gay marriage legislation will stop for the next twenty years or so and that thirty states already define marriage as between one man and one woman. They do not believe that the supreme court would overturn gay marriage bans as unconstitutional and believes that states will ultimately be the ones to recognize whether it should be legal or not. They argue that current marriage laws are disputed between states and have been for decades and believes that the courts will be unable to intervene.
 S2 believes that a federal recognition of gay marriage will be soon coming, and argues against S1's claims on the basis of Roberts and Alito being constitutional literalists. They believe that there is enough support in the Supreme Court to follow the constitution as written and that it will find any laws prohibiting gay marriage unconstitutional as a result.

 S1: Washington DC' s city council recently legalized gay marriage. People's support of gay marriage has been growing steadily in the past ten years, and will soon be the majority opinion. Five states have already legalized gay marriage. Those opposed to gay marriage may view gays as promiscuous and sexual deviants, but most gay men are assuredly quite normal. Civil unions will not be accepted in place of marriage, as they do not allow the same legal rights as marriage.
  
 S2:  Councils and legislatures may vote in favor of gay marriage, but it has yet to be the majority vote of the people. Gay marriage should be played in a positive light by its supporters, because the current public perception of gay men is that they are promiscuous and lead a "gay lifestyle" that is offensive. Anti-gay marriage supporters will support civil unions in lieu of gay marriage, and homosexuals should be satisfied with that.

S2 retorts that gays lose every time gay marriage is put to a vote in a ballot, and that gays need a better PR strategy.  He also states that majority of people will support civil unions with the same benefits but not marriage and there will be repercussions due to the efforts to give tax money to federal employee's same sex partners despite the Defense of Marriage Act.  To contradict, S2 states that so far 5 states have passed gay marriage laws, and that gay people pay their taxes just like everyone else.  He also states that the gay community is not a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people.

 S1 announces the vote to support gay marriage in DC and congratulates the District.  S1 feels the majority of society does support marriage equality and will vote for it advising five states had already voted for and passed same sex unions.  S1 advises they would be happy to accept the title Civil Union as long as the same rights were extended which are given to hetero couples.  S1 also acknowledges the negative image gays have received is part of the reason some will not accept the concept of gay marriage an advises work is needed to change these stereotypes in order to move forward.
 
 S2 believes once brought to a public vote, marriage equality will not be passed and believes a majority of people would support civil unions but not marriage of same sex couples due to insurance benefits and other benefits afforded to married couples.  He/she does not support the argument of five states having voted on gay marriage but instead believes these were passed without a ballot vote. S2 agrees.

 S1 has posted news of the DC Council voting to authorize gay marriage and is celebratory about it.  S2 (JP) asserts that the politicians will pay a price and that the matter will be overturned when it is put to a vote.  He argues that a majority of people, including himself, would support laws providing rights and benefits for gays who elect to enter into civil unions, but not gay marriage.  He asserts no electorate would vote for gay marriage.  S1 refutes the suggestion by noting that 5 States had already approved gay marriage.  He also notes that gay marriage laws would not force heterosexuals to enter into them or attend gay weddings.  S2 seemingly corrects S1 by noting that the States in question had not put the issue to the general public for a vote.  S1 states that he would be happy with civil union laws, and each of them agree that the gay community has a PR problem and that many homosexuals are actually boring and inconspicuous.

 S1 believes that since support for marriage equality is growing, it is only a matter of time before the majority votes in its favor. This person uses the DC council votes as evidence to support this as well as the fact that five states have passed gay marriage legislation. They state that any step towards viewing homosexuals as normal people is a good thing, and that even viewing civil unions in a positive light would and could be enough.
 S2 does not believe that marriage equality is something that the majority of the voters wish to see enacted. This person argue that any legislation put into motion has been pushed around the voters, and never accounted for on an actual ballot. They refute S1's argument that five states have passed gay marriage legislation on the grounds that it was not done via the voters, and never actually put on a ballot. They argue that if homosexuals were willing to simply accept civil unions that are equivalent to marriage, they might find stronger grounds for legal acceptance.

S1 compares homosexual relationships to those of men who practice multiple marriage contending homosexuals are more committed to fidelity than those who believe in multiple marriage.  S2 begs the question of how anyone can say that a man who believes in and practices multiple marriage does not love all of his wives.  S2 cites a 2003 study advising at that time, 62% of Americans were not in favor of gay unions.  S1 believes the roots are deeper than that particular poll.

 S1 and S2 are discussing the issue of marriage equality.  Both subjects seem to be on the fence with the issue.  S1 cites that eight of nine supreme courts have contended same sex marriage to be unconstitutional.  S2 questions how gay marriage would violate someone's constitutional rights.  S1 advises the bulk of the arguments were based on state constitutions which mirror the federal constitution.  S2 uses the example of Massachusetts' allowing gay marriage under its state constitutional law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation.  S1 contends there is no such piece to the Massachusetts constitution.  S2 then concedes he was incorrect about the citing and the law actually banned only discrimination based on gender and not sexual orientation.

 S1 stated that eight out of nine state supreme courts have found that disallowing same sex marriage is unconstitutional and these states had constitutions which are similar to the U.S. Constitution. There continues to be the dual nature of marriage with the courts having to decide about it legally. Now the religions have to interpret it as they will. He closed with, " Gay rights is a real test of our constitutional system , and , so far , we're not passing with flying colors."
 S2 questioned if they found that it violated their State constitutions alone or if it was the violation of the Federal Constitution that mattered in these cases. Many state constitutions guarantee rights that aren't in the federal constitution .

 S1 states that the majority of the supreme court cases which have addressed a ban on same-sex marriage have deemed the laws unconstitutional. He recognized the difficulty imposed by the fact that marriage is both a legal contract and a religious ceremony. He claims that although the cited cases involved state constitutions, the ruling were based on provisions very similar to the federal constitution. 
 S2 argues that supreme court decisions regarding violations of state constitutions are irrelevant to the federal constitution. He claims that the Massachusetts ruling was based on a provision prohibiting discrimination based on sexual preference which is not found in the federal constitution, but later admits that he was in error and that it was based on prohibiting discrimination based on sex.

 Two people are debating the topic of gay marriage rights.  S1 believes allowing gays to marry will open up the door to legalize other types of marriage such as polygamy.  S2 holds to the theory that if King David was able to have multiple wives, why then should the common man not be able to, especially if religion is to now be the basis for all laws.  S1 contends that practice was of the Old Testament and is no longer considered commonplace.  S2 feels S1 is too left wing to entertain the thought of allowing gay marriage, but uses religion as the basis even though there are so many contradictions between the Old Testament and what is considered the New Testament.

 S1 stated that the legalization of gay marriage would lead to polygamists getting the right to marry so many laws against gay marriage also outlaw polygamy.  He then said that the Right Wing was against both gay marriage and polygamy while the left wing was for it. He then said that many Democrats were bigger spenders than the Republicans.
 S2 said that it was funny to him that those for less laws on the books and a return to the Old Testament practices including polygamy are now considered left wing.  He said that he does what he thinks is right and believes that Jesus is not against polygamy. He said too that the past Democratic presidents left far fewer deficits than the Republican presidents.

 S1 claims that legalizing homosexual marriage would eventually lead to the legalization of polygamous marriage, citing a proposed constitutional amendment that bans both gay marriage and polygamy. He cites a passage from the Bible where Jesus said a man should be cleaved to his wife.  He claims that if people on the right wing support a ban on gay marriage, then the left wing must oppose a ban on gay marriage.
 S2 cites instances of God supporting polygamy in the Bible. He claims that we already practice serial polygamy because of America's liberal divorce laws. He also points out the logical fallacy in S1's argument about the left and right wing, stating that one wing supporting something doesn't mean the other wing opposes it.

 Two people are discussing gay marriage and law. S1 states that gay marriage will ultimately lead to a marriage bill for polygamists.  He states King David had multiple wives under the Old testament, and that divorce laws were granted by Moses because of the hardness of people's hearts. In addition, he states that the left wing aren't against deficits, since numerous Democrats want to spend more than Bush.  S2  states that America already has serial polygamy due to the liberal divorce laws. He doesn't remember Jesus saying polygamy was wrong, and even though he referred to a single wife, basing a whole social convention on one word out of the book is absurd. He also states that even conservatives criticize Bush's spending.

 S1 talks about gay marriage leading to polygamy and that's why the push for the Constitutional Amendment banning gay marriage has a provision banning polygamy. S1 thinks King David having more than one wife was based on Old Testament law and Jesus believed in having one wife. He thinks if it's right wing to support a ban on gay marriage/polygamy then it's left wing to oppose it. He states some Democrats wanted to spend more than Bush. S2 thinks if it was okay for King David to have more than one wife it should be fine for him, and brings up that Jews don't follow the New Testament. He believes anything opposed to one wing must be the other. He thinks conservatives spend more money.

 S1 is against gay rights apparently because of the biblical story of Sodom, and the sexual activities S1 perceives to have occurred in San Francisco bath houses, which S1 asserts the current gay community is trying to re-open.  He argues that the gay community is going back to unprotected sex and that a daisy chain of 100 men perform unprotected sex on each other in the bath houses.  S2 challenges the assumptions, specifically finding the daisy chain of 100 men a less than credible assertion and admonishes S1 to use facts to support his arguments, not opinions.  S2 also notes that S1's apparent fascination with bath houses is not relevant to the gay rights topic under which the posts are being entered.

 Two people are discussing gay rights.  S1 compares the behavior of the gay community to Sodom.  He references how in the 80s bath houses in San Francisco were closed down when AIDS first came out; in these bath houses 100 men in a daisy chain performed unprotected sex on one another.  S2 retorts that S1 is relying on rumors and misinformation, and since he doesn't have proof of the claim he shouldn't make it.  He states that its comments like these that characterizes a homophobic bigot, where the actions of a small group of gays in California are being equated to the behaviors of all gays.

 S1 and S2 are discussing gay marriage and S2's opposition to it.  S1 feels remarks made by S2 point more to his being a bigot rather than simply opposing gay marriage.  S2 makes reference to a Yahoo search producing information of gay bath houses operating in San Francisco saying 100 males in these places are practicing unprotected sex on one another and this is wrong.  S1 contends the remark pertaining specifically to 100 men shows this information is based more on opinion than fact.  S1 urges S2 to read the article he cited to which S2 responds what is being done in one community to re-open gay bath houses has no bearing on whether or not gay marriages should be permitted.

 S1 thinks a better comparison is Sodom. He argues that 100 men in a daisy chain performing unprotected sex on one another would be in comparison to Sodom. Everyone else should condemn it. He informs S2 of the bathhouses that can be looked up, they were shut down when AIDS first came out and are flourishing once again. He then asks S2 to go to a cite link to see how gays are trying to reopen bath houses in San Francisco.
 S2 argues that S1's comments make him a bigot. He then proclaims that he just doesn't believe anything that S1 is saying. He determines that S2 is making claims without any proof and he wants the claims justified or taken back, then calls S1 irresponsible.

 S1 compares gays to Sodom and justifies it by saying there are bath houses in San Francisco with 100 men performing unprotected sex on each other. He doesn't think it is homophobic, but rather, a fact. He believes they were closed down when AIDS came about but are being opened again. He states it can be found by Google search. S2 thinks this is rumors and misinformation. He questions if S1 got the information from Focus on the Family. He thinks there is no proof of that and it's a homophobic opinion. He believes one should have proof of any claims they make. He furthermore believes that the things that went on in the 80's are not relevant to what today's society has going on.

 Prior to this dialog, S2 apparently likened the gay marriage movement to the Civil Rights movement of the African American community.  S1 is offended by the alleged analogy, finding a material distinction between race and sexual orientation.  She suggests that to view it otherwise would be an insult to all African Americans.  S2 points out that two presumably prominent African American figures, Corretta Scott King and Jullian Bond, are pro-gay marriage.  S1 questions whether they do in fact support gay marriage, and S2 provides links to support his assertion.  S1 accepts the evidence and concedes that some African Americans may not be as insulted by the analogy and wonders how Martin Luther King felt about the issue of gay marriage.

 S1 and S2 are calmly discussing gay marriage and the comparison between the gay community and African Americans and their struggle for equal rights.  S1 believes it is an insult to all of African American society to compare these two plights.  S2 provides a website containing information advising Coretta Scott King supports gay marriage equality. S2 also advises he/she has given this website example several times in the past.  S1 changes his statement of the comparison's being an insult to all African Americans to some but also poses the question of hour Reverend Martin Luther King would feel about gay marriage advising his opinion would mean more than either of the examples cited by S2 which also included Jullian Bond.

 S1 doesn't want people to compare a race of people's fight for equal rights to a class of people determined by their sexual orientation. She then asks for a cite link that says African Americans are for gay marriage. S1 claims that S2 can't come up with a reference link. Then, she turns her question to African Americans and asks how Martin Luther King Junior would have felt about this issue- he has more credibility than all of her examples.
 S2 argues that Coretta Scott King and Jillian Bond are against gay rights. She lets S1 know that cite links have been shared many times. She then shares a couple of links for S1 to see and then replies that no one will ever know for sure.

 S1 does not agree with the comparison of gay rights and gay marriage to African American civil rights. He believes it is an insult to all African Americans. He asks for references of Coretta Scott King and Julian Bond being for gay marriage and is surprised to get them. He then amends his statement from all African Americans to most African Americans. He goes on to wonder what MLK would have had to say on the subject. He considers MLK to have far more credibility than either of the two people referenced. S2 doesn't agree all African Americans are against gay marriage or that it's an insult and posts two different reference links to both Coretta Scott King and Julian Bond being for gay marriage.

 S1 does not believe that anyone outside of a heterosexual marriage should be considered a husband, wife or a spouse because legally they are not. This person believes that the term gay marriage is an oxymoron because marriage, legally, to them, is only between one man and one woman. They believe that prior to Roosevelt, society did not accept the idea of state welfare as constitutional, but because people were willing to sacrifice freedom for security, they eventually caved to his ideas.
 S2 does not believe that marriage is simply between one man and one woman, and that the entire reason behind the debate is so that homosexual marriage can and will be legally recognized. They do not see a reason for discrimination against homosexual marriage.

 S1 claims that gay husband, gay wife, and gay spouse are not legally recognized categories because homosexual unions do not meet the legal criteria for marriage, namely that it occurs between one man and one woman. He claims that because of this, many people view the term gay marriage as an oxymoron. He uses the example that a cat cannot be called a dog just because someone wants to. He admits, however, that there is a possibility that gay unions might eventually be recognized with the same rights as heterosexual unions. S2 asks why a homosexual union is not legally recognized. He claims that appealing to the traditional definition of marriage is circular reasoning and therefore insufficient to explain why homosexuals are being discriminated against.

 S1 and S2 are discussing the topic of gay marriage.  S1 feels the term husband is not recognizable in a same sex relationship nor is the term wife.  S2 feels the only reason these terms are not recognized is because the couple is gay and gay marriage is not yet recognized legally.  S1 holds that the marriage is viewed legally as one man and one woman, not same sex; comparing the theory that a cat is not a dog simply because one chooses to call it so.  S1 also cites that according to the CBO, 600,000 gay couples would want to wed if legislation were passed to allow it.  S2 wants logical reasons for now allowing gays to marry.

 S1 agrees that when a husband is part of a heterosexual relationship a gay husband is not legally recognized in the same category. His statistics support the fact that 60,000 gay couples would get married if they were allowed. The equal rights aren't there when it comes to same sex marriage. Welfare is referenced when making a point about political muscle. American freedom never existed and no one can't argue that FDR's public opinion on the role on the federal government. S2 thinks that it is a problem because same sex marriage has never been legally recognizes is a big problem.  The debate is more for straight couples than it is about gay relationships. He notes that there are logical reasons for marriage discrimination.

However, they point out that in other countries such as Spain, they might not, but in general, the belief is the same globally.

S2 argues that most Christians do oppose same-sex marriage, civil unions, gay adoption, and anti-discrimination laws.

But you forget , I'm not one of " those " who feels the need to impose my morality on everyone else . I'm more than willing to let society as a whole determine its own limits .

 S1 concedes that there would be little financial impact on support for homosexual marriage, and would in fact supply a surplus. However, this person still desires a debate on moral and health concerns of the issue. They do not view themselves as someone who imposes their moral beliefs on others, and is willing to let society determine its own limits. While they vocally defend the United States Constitution as written, they also desire to be more flexible with public determined acceptance of behavior.
 S2 would like to see this concession as a means to lead to a discussion on the societal benefits of same-sex marriage, however, they believe that S1 is attempting to hide behind their moral grounds because S1 sees it as relative and subjective.

 S1 admits that he previously misrepresented a statistics, claiming that a particular study actually predicted a $1 billion surplus as a result of legalizing same-sex marriage. He claims that although this alleviates his fiscal concerns on the topic, he still objects to same-sex marriage on the grounds of moral and health concerns. S2 suggests that if S1 was wrong about the surplus he might also be wrong about other aspects of the issue of same-sex marriage. He suggests that it would be useful to discuss the ways same-sex marriage could benefit society instead of moving on to a discussion of morality since it is relative and subjective. S1 responds that he doesn't want to impose his morals on others, but believes in defending the Constitution.

 Two people are discussing the financial effect of allowing for gay marriage.  S1 originally believed allowing gay marriage would have a negative financial impact on society as a whole.  He has since amended that belief due to information found in the CBO.  His reasoning for still supporting the ban on gay marriage has changed over to moral and health related concerns.  Although S2 is pleased with the concession of S1's former opinion, he believes jumping to the moral high ground still ignores other issues.  He would like to discuss the positive impact that allowing gay marriage would have on the country practically.  S1 advises while he is a defender of the Constitution, he does feel society should decide.

He states his wish to move past fiscal concerns and move ont the the moral and health concerns of same-sex marriage.  S2 contends that he wishes to discuss the practical benefits.  He states that the discussion of "morality" is a safe ground because morality is relative and subjective.

 S1 apologizes for jumping the gun and misreading the one billion dollar surplus link. He/She admits that the civil debate issue about gays didn't have such of a a negative financial impact as they first thought. He then proposes concerns about what the moral and health concerns would be if we continue to do this with civility . S1 is more flexible with accepting societies standard of behavior and is also willing to let society as a whole determine what the limit of same sex marriage is. S2 was hoping to talk more about the fiscal concerns, and he also wants to know how same-sex marriage benefits society in practical ways. He also thinks that same sex marriage does, in fact benefit our U.S.

 S1 makes the claim that marriage is defined as a family unit based on natural heterosexual contact, and suggests that it is the heterosexual nature of the relationship that is important, not how the children are conceived within the relationship. He argues that homosexuals are attempting to force their morals on others by legalizing same-sex marriage, claiming that legalizing a behavior is a tacit form of acceptance that will affect society. S2 questions the religious basis of a civil ceremony like marriage, suggesting that the stipulations based on religious reasons would vary depending on the chosen religion. He also compares homosexuality to polygamy, claiming that polygamy has been unofficially accepted for years, and argues that maintaining the current same-sex marriage bans should be considered discriminatory.

 S1 views the marriage arrangement as society recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract. He explains that natural means between a man and a woman. He accepts that everyone has their own values but it is unreasonable to expect that all values are socially acceptable. He believes legalizing gay marriage is a form of forcing society to accept gay behavior.
 S2 questions the validity of using the term natural to define marriage. He uses an example of same-sex marriage in a Congo tribe to show that marriage is defined by the needs of the social group. Banning gay marriage is forcing one set of believes onto others. He argues that legalizing gay marriage does not force gay values onto anyone.

 Two subjects are discussing the issue of gay marriage rights.  S1 is anti-marriage redefinition while S2 is pro-gay marriage.  S1 feels marriage is classified by a heterosexual contract and is not legal or natural if it involves couples of the same sex.  S2 challenges the religious aspects of S1's belief because God is not involved in the ceremonies performed by a judge and not in a church.  He also offers information in regard to a tribe in the Congo which required its warriors to marry other warriors as they believed relations with women would soften them.  S1 advises values are always believed to be correct by the person or group who practices them. S2 doesn't think morals should be forced.

S1 states that it is not about the way children are created but about the nature of the relationship, which remains natural. S2 then questions which god would enforce marriage when the ceremony is done by a judge, and he states that polygamy is a way for bisexuals to stay under the radar.  He states that the US has been dealing with polygamy for years, with very few prosecutions.  S1 contends that polygamy wouldn't count because it is one man or women married to multiple members of the opposite sex.

 S2 suggests that he would be liberal if modern liberalism was actually Jeffersonian, meaning that democracy is viewed as the power of the people. He cites Jefferson's beliefs that war can be necessary in order to maintain liberty and that centralized government is a threat, and points out how these beliefs are the opposite of modern liberalism. He further claims that the current Democratic party is anti-religion, over-regulatory, and controlled by the gay lobby. S1 interprets S2's argument as a claim that fairness should exist for all people except homosexuals. S2 clarifies that he does support equal opportunity for all people regardless of their sexual behavior, but that he is still opposed to redefining the traditional view of marriage by legalizing same-sex marriage for homosexuals.

 S1 asks S2 to clarify his statement about Jeffersonian liberalism. He believes that S2 is hypocritical about supporting Jeffersonian values on "making sure there is fairness" and "honest advocacy" for the people while opposing gay marriage. 
 S2 believes that the term "liberalism" has a different meaning different compared to the time of Thomas Jefferson. He said that Jefferson is for decentralization of government which is the opposite stance taken by the Democratic Party. He believes that liberalism has been hijacked by extremist special interest groups such as the gay lobby. The Democratic Party today is favoring special interest groups instead of engaging in honest advocacy for the people. S2 supports equal opportunity for gay people, but not the redefinition of marriage in the US.

S2 advises Jefferson believed liberty would be threatened by a centralized government.  He also advises liberalism is not based on the same theory.  S1 believes the opposite stating the opinion that the group believes in fairness for all, except the gay community.  S2 advises he supports equal opportunities for all people despite their sexual preferences; however, he does not support the redefinition of marriage to allow for gay unions.  S1 feels this is a double standard because it is basically saying equal rights for all but gays still cannot marry.

He says he agrees with taking care of the elderly, fairness, and freedom.

 S2 claims that marriage is defined as a family unit based on a heterosexual contract. S1 refutes this assertion, citing a number of countries which recognize same-sex marriage and compares the lack of reproductive potential for homosexual couples to a heterosexual couple that chooses not to have children or is unable to have children. He also argues that single parent families are not considered traditional and references a poll showing support for gay rights among the 18 - 29 demographic. S2 claims that a traditional family is composed of a husband and wife and that the laws of other countries are irrelevant to the laws of America.

He compares homosexual partners to roommates and and demonstrates that you can not make marriage mean whatever you want by explaining that he is not legally allowed to marry his dog. He makes it clear that he believes same-sex marriage is wrong and claims that the majority of Americans are also against same-sex marriage. S2 suggests that homosexual partners would not be a burden on the mentioned systems because they would be paying into the systems as well as receiving benefits from them. He cites the legalization of same-sex marriages in various other countries in Europe and North America.

 S1 asserts that the push for gay marriage is driven by economics. Gay marriage can bring in new taxes. S1 describes himself as a Jeffersonian Liberal who believes in the application of the Constitution as it is written. He believes that the majority of Americans are against gay marriage. He believes that the majority will support less ambiguous laws that ban gay marriage. 
 S2 argues that legalizing gay marriage will alleviate the state's burden on support for the dependent spouse in the case of a break-up. Without gay marriage, the state has to support the dependent spouse. S2 feels that a federal amendment to the US Constitution is unlike over the next few years.

 S1 and S2 are discussing the issue of gay marriage and the financial effect it will have on society.  S1 is against gay marriage due to the effects he believes passing such a law will have on society while S2 is in favor.  S1 feels allowing gay marriage would cause a dependent class needing more benefits of one kind or another.  S2 questions why gay citizens who pay into the economic system should also not benefit from them.  He also provides an analogy based on a marriage break up to support this, advising if gay marriage were recognized and there was a divorce, the spouse making more money would have to pay alimony instead of the other going to the state.

 S1 believes gay marriage is about economics. It would create a new dependent class and be a large new tax on businesses, Social Security, and healthcare. He thinks same sex partners living together are roommates. Roommates are single and should not have marriage benefits. S1 states he is a Jeffersonian liberal and believes in the Constitution as written and the people's will. Most Americans, he thinks, are against gay marriage. S2 states that gay people pay into those same systems and believes they should also benefit from them. He believes there is an economic burden when same sex couples break up without legal recognition of the marriage. He states that same sex couples are not single and they are not the same thing as roommates.

 Two people are discussing the economics of gay marriage.  S1 states that gay marriage poses a tremendous new tax on the economy as it would create a new dependent class that doesn't presently exist.  He compares same-sex marriage to single couple roommates and states that if it isn't in the definition of marriage, it isn't marriage.  S2 states that since gay people pay into the same system, they should also benefit from it.  He states that by not allowing gay marriage, if a divorce occurs the state would have to care for the dependent partner, instead of the richer partner as in heterosexual marriages.  He also states that a federal marriage amendment to the constitution is a long shot.

 S1 cites a key statement in the same-sex marriage legislation that allows marriage officers the right not to perform a same-sex marriage if it conflicts with their conscience, religion, or beliefs. He believes this is a good caveat, claiming that forcing officials to perform same-sex marriages would be infringing upon their religious freedom. He argues that if a public official had a religious objection to heterosexual marriages, then he would not expect that person to perform his marriage and would instead seek out someone who would. S2 believes it is inappropriate for public officials to be able to deny services based on their personal religious beliefs. If they are unable to do their job, he suggests, they should not be able to hold that position.

 S1 and S2 are discussing the situation in which a marriage officiant may be requested to perform a gay marriage but have personal religious beliefs against homosexuality or gay marriage.  S1 defends and respects the personal religious beliefs and notes that the provision they are discussing (which is either a law or a proposed law) provides the marriage official with the ability to opt out of performing the ceremony if it violates his or her religious beliefs.  S2 finds that offensive, reasoning that if the person is licensed by the state to perform marriage ceremonies that person should do so for all marriages, not just heterosexual marriages.  S1 asserts that South Africa takes his view, while S2 claims Canada sides with him.

 Two people are discussing marriage freedom and religious freedom.  S1 quotes a provision that states that marriage officers do not need to perform a ceremony between same-sex couples if it conflicts with their conscience, religion or belief.  He states that he would not want someone to be forced to do something against their religious beliefs, as if it were the case with his heterosexual civil ceremony, he would find someone else to do it.

 S2 said that public officials should serve the public equally under the law as that is what they are supposed to do. He said that they should have to look for another job if they do not want to do their jobs. He expressed his gladness at being in Canada where there are more rights.

 S2 feels that it is unfortunate if that applies to public officials, as they believe that public officials must serve the public in its entirety, equally, under the law.

 S1 claims that the number of earthquakes occurring outside of Israel has increased in the last hundred years, comparing 20 large earthquakes in the latter half of the 20th century to only 15 large earthquakes in the first half of the 20th century, and only 7 large earthquakes in the entire 19th century. S1 argues that this information is clear evidence that the frequency of earthquakes is increasing over time. S2 refutes S1 claim of increasing earthquake frequency, suggesting that the greater number of earthquakes detected could be a matter of increases in our ability to detect earthquakes rather than an actual increase in the number of earthquakes occurring. S1 takes this point into consideration, but claims that the evidence still supports his original claim.

 S1 argues that the number of earthquakes has been increasing in recent times, citing statistics for larger earthquakes suggesting the frequency of large earthquakes increased five fold from the 19tyh to 20th centuries.  The context of the discussion may be religious as S1 mentions Israel as well as the U.S. Constitution and rights of minorities versus majority rule.  S2 seems exasperated with S1's comments here and in prior posts and suggests that advances in detection technology and increases in recording practices could explain any seeming increase in the frequency of earthquakes, and that S1 is merely looking at statistics unscientifically to support the assertion.  S1 is confident she accounted for the variables mentioned by S2 by limiting her argument to large earthquakes.

He contends that there has been 20 large earthquakes in the latter half of this century, compared to about 15 for the first half and about 7 in the entire 19th century. S2 retorts that the method used to detect and record earthquakes have been taking exponential leaps forward, and he states that S1 is taking statistics from one source without critical thought an accepting it as fact.  S1 rebuts stating that the new methods detect minimal or localized earthquakes and that major ones can be detected without a seismograph.

 S1 discussed the increase in earthquakes outside of Israel in the last 100 years and said it is "love waxing cold."  He noted that there have been 20 large earthquakes just in this part of the century that were easy to detect even without a seismograph . He said he did other research which showed the same results even when that was taken into account. He said that he knows that he differs with S2 as he believes that the majority rules in the United States  unless it violates the constitution . S2  said that he felt like shaking something at S2 and then asked S1 about the advances in the recording of the earthquakes and challenged his source and his statistics. He also challenged S1's earthquake argument.

He accuses S2 of attempting to change the debate and making personal attacks rather than addressing the question at hand. He suggests that if the debate occurs, he will prove his assertions true.
 S2 claims that the origin of AIDS in the United States is unknown and that the spread of AIDS was caused by unclean needles, unprotected sex, and contaminated blood transfusions.

He wishes to debate S2. S2 believes no one knows how AIDS came to the US and states that people using dirty needles, those participating in unsafe sex, and those involved in blood transfusions before they knew how it was spread were the ones that made it a health concern.

S2 also cites the practice of untested blood transfusions before it was discovered how AIDS could be spread.

 S2 stated his belief that it remains a mystery about how AIDs reached the United States and that IV drug users who exchanged needles without cleaning them and those who did not practice safe sex and those who gave blood for transfusions before AIDS was known about spread the disease.

 S2 suggests that deviation from the norm is simply a form of diversity and is not necessarily perverse. He accuses S1 of hating homosexuals.

 S1 claims that homosexual partners shouldn't expect shared healthcare in the same way that an unmarried couple shouldn't. He suggests that homosexuals are not being denied any rights, that they have all the same rights as heterosexuals. He points out that nobody can marry someone of the same sex, not just homosexuals. He rejects the idea that homosexuals will succeed in legalizing same-sex marriage, citing several cases where homosexual marriages were banned.
 S2 accuses S1 of accepting that some people should not receive the basic right to marry the person they love. He likens this to slavery, prohibition, and women's suffrage.

 S1 claims that because healthcare is generally extended to spouses, homosexuals will not be eligible to receive healthcare through their partner because same-sex marriages are not recognized in Virginia. He likens this situations to a heterosexual male with a girlfriend who would not receive his healthcare benefits. He presents his opinion that homosexuals should move out of Virginia and his hope that same-sex marriages will be made illegal everywhere.
 S2 argues that the cases presented by S1 are not equivalent because the heterosexual male has the right to marry his girlfriend if he chooses, at which point she would be eligible for his benefits. He also points out that after cohabitating for a certain period of time, the woman would be eligible under common law marriage.

 S1 says that healthcare applies to spouses, so if it is illegal for gay people to get married in VA they can't share healthcare. He goes on to say it works the same way if a straight man has a girlfriend. She can't get healthcare through his job. He hopes gay people upset by VA leave and that gay marriage gets outlawed everywhere so he doesn't have to hear gay people complain anymore. S1 corrects S2's grammar when he types common law. S2 states that a straight man can marry his girlfriend and she can get healthcare, but gay people are prohibited from getting married. He believes that if two people cohabitate for awhile or have children they should get healthcare because of Common law.

 Two subjects are discussing Virginia's unwillingness to allow gay couples to marry.  S1 is using the basis that the request for legalizing gay marriage is mostly based on the want and need for healthcare benefits one's spouse in entitled to using the example that if a gentleman and his girlfriend are not married, the girlfriend would not be eligible for healthcare under the boyfriend either.  S2 contends this is not a singular subject and is more based on rights as the heterosexual couple S1 uses as an example has the right to get married if they choose, while a gay couple does not have the option to make that same choice to.  S1 holds hope that gay marriage will be banned everywhere.

 S1:1 started his comments by talking about the fact that typically only spouses are eligible for health care and that if it is illegal for gays to marry in VA then of course there would be no health care coverage for them in VA. He then compared this to what happens with the girlfriend of a straight guy who cannot get his healthcare benefits. He then said that he hopes that gay marriage stay out of VA so there will not be trouble and that gay marriage will be outlawed everywhere so that gays will stop complaining about the lack of healthcare. 
 S2 pointed out the fact that the straight guy can marry or have a common law relationship so his girlfriend can get benefits.

 Two people are discussing marriage benefits.  S1 states that healthcare usually applies to spouses, so in order to get the benefits of any health care provided by a spouses job the requirement is marriage.  Since gays can't get married, they cannot share in each other's health care, and he hopes that gay marriages will be sorted out so he doesn't have to hear them complain about health care. He then uses an example of a straight guy who has a girlfriend who can't get any health care because they're not married, and he asks S2 if she hould get benefits.   S2 contends that legally if they cohabitate for a prescribed period of time or have children, by common law they can.

 S1 does not believe that what Jefferson recommended be done to homosexuals is okay. They point out that according to the Christian faith it is sinful, but not to modern law. They argue that the country is not a theocracy, and allows everyone equal rights to practice their religious beliefs as they see fit, but likewise does not allow for one to exert control over another.
 S2 believes Jefferson was correct in stating homosexuality as being a crime. They believe that since they personally think it is a sin, there should be a penalty against homosexuals and those that advocate it. They argue that liberal tolerance assumes a mindset that advocates its own views on conduct at the exclusion and dismissal of those that do not.

 S1 claims that Thomas Jefferson did not recommend the negative behaviors that are targeted toward homosexuals, and that although homosexuality is a sin according to Christianity and may have been illegal in the past, it is not anymore. He points out that America is not a theocracy and that Christians are not persecuted, citing the fact that they are free to practice religion as they choose. 
 S2 claims that Thomas Jefferson was correct in labeling homosexuality as a sin and a crime. He believes that there should be heavy monetary fines for engaging in or advocating homosexual behavior. He argues that liberal tolerance is just as dogmatic as Christianity, and that it is no more right to base laws on this perspective over any another.

 S2 thinks homosexuality is a sin and should be a crime along with heavy fines. S2 believes liberals are hypocritical in talking about tolerance and justice. He thinks liberals think only they are right, push the liberal way as social norm, and ridicule anyone that doesn't agree. S2 points out this isn't a theocracy and that if someone wants to live in a society based on religion there are other places that have that. S2 thinks Christians are hypocrites because they claim to be persecuted because they can't force their religion on others. He says they may practice as they wish, but they can't force others to do so.

 S1 believes while homosexuality was considered a crime in earlier times, it is no longer a crime today.  S1 feels S2's argument of liberal persecution can't hold water due to the fact that liberal tolerance is what allows for S2 to worship as he/she chooses and state openly his/her opinions.
 
 S2 believes homosexuality should still be considered a crime and those who participate in it should be punished by law along with those who support them.  S2 also believes liberal tolerance is as a whole, not actually tolerant.  Feeling also people with other views from liberalism are persecuted for non-acceptance publicly.  S1 advises gay marriage was voted on and lost there they live and feels it is mostly based upon religious values.

To contradict, S1 states that the "liberal" tolerance still allows for the free practice of religion.

 S1 and S2 discuss the United States Constitutional legal system and whether and how same sex marriage can be banned.  S1 believes the concept of marriage has evolved dramatically over time and can now be declared by the Supreme Court to be a fundamental right not to be denied to same sex couples.   S2 believes it is a legislative matter which should be left to voting.  S1 argues that fundamental rights are protected by the Constitution and are not subject to a plebescite.

 S1 thinks the definition of marriage is subject to change. As an example S1 points to an old definition of marriage in which a woman lost her identity into that of a man. S1 believes fundamental rights are not subject to vote and cites Loving v. Virginia as an example. He believes the courts are an intermediate body between the people and legislature; thus to ban gay marriage one must prove it isn't a right or give compelling evidence against it. S2 wonders what marriage being a fundamental right has to do with defining marriage. If marriage is subject to change then he asks how it is supposed to be changed if not by vote. He takes issue with the judiciary becoming the legislative branch.

 The issue is here is the definition of marriage, and what government body/level has the right to change this definition.
 
 Speaker one believes that courts and federal government should be able to rule on the definition of marriage and cites several previous cases in the past where the federal government stepped up to introduce legislature. This speaker believes that "fundamental rights" are not subject to state votes and can be decided by government.
 
 Speaker two believes that each state should decide the definition of marriage and questions what "fundamental rights" have to do with the "definition" of marriage. This speaker believes that it should left up to a vote to decide the definition of marriage and that legislature should not be confused with judiciary.

 Two people are discussing gay marriage laws.  S1 states that since the traditional definition of marriage is human made, it can be changed to meet changing times.  S2 contends that the legal definition is human made and can change, but since we're in a democracy it must change by vote.  He also states that so far votes favor a "one man one woman" definition of marriage.  S1 states that the courts were designed to be an intermediate between people and legislature, and if same gender marriage can be banned by state action it must be proven that marriage is not a fundamental right.  S2 states that by allowing this the judiciary branch becomes the legislative branch, which is not so.

 Two people are debating gay marriage rights.  S1 is pro gay marriage while S2 appears against.  S1 feels the constitution can evolve with changing times because it is a man-made construct while S2 cites the fact 26 states still consider the sanctity of marriage to be one man and one woman.  Also advising a key point to the nation is the basis of laws being voted upon.  S2 does not feel S1's statements are correct regarding whether or not marriage is a right.  S1 sites Loving v. Virginia in argument marriage is not a human construct. S1 also advises marriage is a fundamental right and should be a fundamental right for all not to be determined by each state individually.

 Two subjects are discussing the issue of homosexuality versus religion.  S1 believes homosexuality is a denial of religion.  S2 believes everything written modernly in regard to religion is hearsay as there were no eye witnesses to things such as the resurrection of the portrayed Christ.  S1 feels believing as S2 does basically signs his entrance into Hell.  S2 challenges that if the teachings of the Bible which S1 continuously clings to are to be believed in, then those who profess to be Christians would also fall to Hell for violation.  S1 feels S2 is a sodomite and should repent.  S2 feels S1 clings to religion as a basis for his belief because he is unable to offer substantial proof.

 S1 attacked S1's lack of belief in the resurrection of Jesus. He said that until S2 presents credible scholarship and good arguments that burst the belief in the resurrection of Jesus he is nothing more than a Christ denier and might as well go into the Pit. And of course since he is gay and is a Sodomite he would not go to heaven unless he repented. 
 S2 called S1's reply lame and then proceeded to argue that there were no eyewitness accounts only hearsay, no evidence, etc. and that S1 should be the one to come up with proof. He said to S1, Ezridden, that if the pit really existed then Ezridden would be there too because of how he treats other people.

 S1 claims that it is necessary for S2 to provide credible arguments and scholarship refuting the resurrection of Christ to be taken seriously. He accuses S2 of being a left wing Christ denier and suggests that S2 will go to Hell unless he repents. 
 S2 argues that the burden of proof should actually be on the people claiming the resurrection is true. He cites the fact that there are no eye witness accounts or other proof of the resurrection and that scientific evidence suggests that it is highly improbable for a man to be revived after being dead for three days. He suggests that even if the Bible were completely true, many self-professed Christians would also be condemned to Hell for their non-Christian behaviors.

 Two people are discussing Christianity.  S2 contends that there is no eye witness accounts of any resurrection ever recorded, and that everything in the Gospels is hearsay.  He states that not only is there evidence, but scientifically and logically no one can be dead for three days and get up and walk away.  He also states that the burden of proof instead lies with those who believe in the resurrection, and that based on the way Christians life their lives they would ironically end up in the pit also.  S1 states that it is all unfounded conjecture, full of left wing, antichrist dysentery.  He challenges S2 to find credible arguments that bust the resurrection of Christ.

 S1 does not believe in Christianity and asks for proof of the resurrection of Christ. He thinks scientific evidence and human intelligence show that a man can't get up after being dead for three days. He sees no evidence of it being true and thinks it's all hearsay and fairy tales. Just because billions believe something it doesn't mean it is true. He believes faced with a lack of evidence Christians resort to name calling and he feels if the pit were real they would both be in it. S2 believes that S1 is a anti-Christ that likes to wine. He does not agree with S1's opinions and thinks there will be no Sodomites, meaning homosexuals, in heaven. He thinks S1 will go to hell.

 S1 and S2 are discussing gay rights.  S1 is in support of gay marriage while S2 supports it.  S2 feels gay rights would impose gay families onto straight members of society while S1 believes S2's opinions are comparable to those of Taliban terrorists.  S2 is in support of comments made by a previous participant, contending he did not make remarks based on mandatory therapy for gays or anything of the like.  S1 believes the previous comments made center on religion and that civil law and religion are not synonymous.  S2 feels his religious beliefs are violated by just the consideration of allowing gay marriage.  S1 believes marriage is a contract between a woman and a man, not same sex.

 S1 labeled someone Mr Taliban and said that this person who is against sharia law is himself imposing that on gays through his religious belief that a civil marriage contract is only for a man and a woman. He said Mr.Taliban's religious beliefs should not have anything to do with civil law. S2 challenged S1's comparison of the man to the Taliban as he has not advocated the execution, jailing, etc. of homosexuals. S2 then stated that is indeed the gay lobby that is attempting to impose its view on the man. S2 concluded by asking S1 to stop complaining as there have been no real violations of S1's rights. S1 said he can have a contract and as much sex as he likes.

 S1 claims that religious beliefs are preventing the recognition of homosexual marriages. He compares basing law on Christian beliefs to be the same thing as Islamists advocating Sharia law. He argues that the religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman should have no influence on a civil marriage contract.
 S2 claims that homosexuals are not being persecuted through things like execution, imprisonment, or mandatory therapy, and that it is actually the homosexual lobby who are pressing their beliefs about marriage onto everyone else. He cites the fact that homosexual marriage has not been banned in any state, it is simply not recognized, and that people are free to sign whatever contracts they want and to engage in intercourse with whomever they want.

He sees no difference in those that oppose gay marriage for religious reasons and have laws against it and Muslims that pass laws based on religion. He finds it hypocritical for people to be against Sharia law when they are, in his opinion, doing the same thing. He believes marriage is a legal contract between two people and the state and he supports gay marriage. S2 does not agree with the comparison of Sharia law and being against gay marriage. He has not advocated for jail time or the death of homosexuals. They are free to do as they wish. He believes gay marriage pushes that relationship onto others, and he opposes it.

 S1 identifies the important spiritual situation that homosexuals are in. He suggests that it is inappropriate to make jokes about homosexual lifestyles, that no one approves of the deviant behaviors practiced by homosexuals, and that it would not be funny if homosexuality was discovered in your own community. S2 claims that sexual behaviors because we do not identify non-homosexuals by the sexual behaviors they engage in, we should not do so for homosexual individuals. He argues that a person's private behaviors are no one else's business, and that a sexual behaviors do not define who someone is as a person. He defends homosexual behaviors by referencing the deviant behaviors performed by heterosexuals, suggesting that deviant sexual acts are not the sole province of homosexuals.

 S1 and S2 are discussing gay marriage and relationships.  S1 is opposed to the issue while S2 is for it.  S1 believes those who practice gay relationships are spiritually lacking and feels S2's sarcasm toward the issue at hand is proof of this.  S2 feels S1 is too literal and obsessed with the issue of gay sex rather than gay marriage.  S2 advises what happens in the bedroom is private and not the issue.  S1 makes some rude remarks in regard to gay sex involving gerbils.  S2 feels many heterosexuals also have a history of doing vulgar things as well and it is unfair to categorize only gay individuals in this manner.  S1 does not agree with this.

 S1 believes that it is a dangerous spiritual situation that S2 is in, and to take homosexuality lightly or amusing in any way is proof that one doesn't care about it. They don't believe that anyone should be laughing or joking at what they think is a perverted and unnatural practice that homosexuals engage in.
 S2 doesn't believe that sexual activity is what makes up the homosexual community, and that people don't, and shouldn't, care about what one does in the bedroom. They believe such activities should remain private and that it is no one else's business. They don't believe that what is done behind closed doors defines a person. They don't agree that homosexuals should be classified as deviant, as heterosexual activities can be likewise.

 S1 makes a comment about gerbils. He believes homosexuals have created sick and perverted sexual practices, such as those involving gerbils, and they are in a dangerous spiritual situation because of it. He denies joking. S2 laughs sarcastically and questions if sex is all some people think about. He thinks no one cares what people do in their bedrooms because it is private and not a reflection of who they are as a person. He states that people do not define their neighbor or mailman based on what they do in their bedroom and that if that were the case there could be many negative comments made about S1.

 S1 asserts that marriage is a contract between two people and the state and that it is not appropriate for religious institutions to be involved with that decision. He claims that because he is forced to accept heterosexual marriages, society should be forced to accept homosexual marriages. He accuses Christian organizations for supporting anti-gay legislation and claims that denying same-sex marriage is unjust, and that preventing same-sex marriage is a method of promoting heterosexual privilege. S2 argues that heterosexual marriage is the status quo, so it rests on proponents of same-sex marriage to demonstrate that this new definition of marriage is superior to the current definition. He argues that we do not actually have a basic right to love or to marry whomever we love.

 S1 and S2 are discussing gay marriage.  Both seem to be somewhat in favor, although S2 seems a bit indifferent to the issue.  S1 feels it is unfair for the gay community to be forced to recognize heterosexual marriages while gay citizens are denied the right to wed.  S2 believes things, including gay marriage, should be voted on and that right and wrong are personal judgments.  S1 then wonders if S2 feels all civil rights should be voted on.  S2 advises that civil rights are actually constitutional rights and cannot and should not be voted on and does not feel that unmarried people, gay or straight are not denied civil rights.  Two people with similar opinions but different views.

He or she believes that Christian organizations have been at the forefront of opposing instating homosexual marriage.

 S1 believes marriage is a contract between the state and two people. He compares it to forming a corporation. He finds it ironic Christians are against the religious aspects of marriage yet, because they are unable to stop religious marriage they want to stop the contract. He believes he is forced to recognize heterosexual marriage and others should recognize gay marriages. He does not believe rights should be voted on and gives an example of slavery. S2 does not think anyone is harmed by gay marriage but believes official policies are everyone's business. Heterosexual marriage is the status quo, so it is thus recognized. Any changes to the status quo should be justified. He doesn't see marriage as a right an example being unmarried people.

She argues that marriage is by definition between a man and a woman even if it is not stated, just as it would not be expressly specified to be between a man and a goldfish.  S2 sees S1 as being anti-gay marriage as a result and challenges her about it, but S1 is actually unopposed to gay marriage.  S1 and S2 also discuss the issue of whether possible production of handicapped children, such as in incestuous relationships or others involving genetically specific information should be barred on public policy grounds.

 S1 is in favor of civil union laws for gay couples, but has a religious based objection to gay marriage because she deems marriage a sacrament and homosexuality a sin according to the bible.  S2 considers the bible to be a complete work of fiction, and makes the argument that a majority group should not deny a minority group a right when that right does not hurt the majority in any way.  He likens the situation of gay marriages being denied by a majority to the idea of California being able to vote to ban the citizens of Michigan from driving.  S1 says S2 should devote more time to perfecting civil union laws, and that gay marriage does hurt the majority population financially.

S2 retorts by stating that civil unions are not equivalent to marriages.  He states that the US government does not consider marriage a sacrament and he states S1 is mixing religion and government.

While S1 agrees church and state are separate entities he/she believes voters can cast a ballot in any direction they so choose, which essentially boils down to each voter's religious beliefs.

 S1 believes that gay activists compare public disapproval of homosexuality with racial discrimination. This person does not agree that this is a viable comparison because they believe that racial discrimination is the hatred or fear of another human being, while the other is just disapproval of another person's behavior. They believe that employers base their employment on competency and not sexuality.
 S2 does not agree that being homosexual is a behavior, and that it is within the rights under current states' laws for employers to let their workers go because of one's sexuality. They believe this is discrimination and not just disapproval because the law supports the right for employers to release employees solely on the fact that they are homosexual and not due to competency.

 S1 claims that it is inappropriate to compare opposing homosexuality with racial discrimination. He explains the difference that racial discrimination is the fear of a particular person and that opposing homosexuality is based on disapproval of a person's behavior. He proposes that if a homosexual were fired from their job, it would be due to their incompetence and not due to their homosexuality. S2 objects to S1's claim that homophobia is disapproval of behavior, questioning which behaviors warrant disapproval. He claims that being homosexual is in itself not a behavior. He also argues that homosexuals are frequently legally fired for their sexual preference with no regard for competence. Finally, he asks what a gay activist is and S1 responds by recommending S2 google the term.

 Two subjects are discussing discrimination against homosexuals in the workplace.  S1 feels there is no comparison between racial discrimination and disapproval of homosexual relationships.  S2 advises it is currently legal to fire someone simply for being gay rather than their ability to complete the job correctly and feels this is discrimination.  S1 feels this is incorrect as discrimination is defined as a hatred or fear of another person or group while disapproval of gay relationships is due to not agreeing with another's behavior.  S2 doesn't feel being gay can be described as a behavior.  S1 feels there is no issue with this practice.  S2 wonders what behavior can be disapproved of if the person does his/her job correctly.

 Two people are discussing the difference between homosexuality and racial discrimination.  S1 contends that one is a hatred or fear of another human being, while the other is a disapproval of someone's behavior.  He states that if a homosexual was fired, it would be for incompetence rather than for being gay.  S2 retorts by stating that it is perfectly legal in most places in the U.S. to fire someone simply for being gay, not for incompetence.  He also states that he is currently sitting in his pajamas being gay.  He then questions what behavior that he is exhibiting that warrants disapproval.

 S1 says it is wrong for gay activists to compare public disapproval of homosexuality with race discrimination. He takes a jab at gay activists love comparing public disapproval of homosexuality with racial discrimination. He has complaints about the public's overwhelming disapproval of another human being's behavior. He notes that the two are two different entities and can't truly be compared . Furthermore, he states if you were fired it would be for being incompetent rather than being gay. He thinks that the questions that the GUEST is asking are not relevant enough to answer them. In the end S1 states that gay activist will soon find out why the behavior and thoughts are what they are. The both argue that each one's wrong.

 S1 claims that the defense of marriage act is not unconstitutional, that the supreme court has yet to rule on it, and that President Obama should be impeached for his behaviors in office. He further suggests that proponents of same-sex marriage should be educated or deported. He then presents a quote from the Bible to justify why homosexuality is wrong. S2 argues that there is nothing wrong with homosexuals and that they are actually an important part of the country. He cites his own ability as a railway conductor and suggests that it would be difficult to find someone to replace him if he were deported for being a homosexual. He also argues that the laws of America are not based on any religious texts.

 S1 cites bible verse to S2 in order to support his argument that homosexuality is depraved.  S2 argues that homosexuals are productive members of society, citing his career as a conductor with a railroad, and noting his rights generally as an American citizen.  S1 calls Obabma a little cretin and thinks he and Holder should be impeached.  He warns S2 that he is going to hell, having purported to cite lines 26 - 28 from Romans Chapter one.  S2 suggests that S1 is a reactionary who would bring back a McCarthy era.  He also notes the bible is not an official text relating to the laws of the United States and that S1's views are unproductive and only foment discord.

S2 rebuts by stating that gay people are the life blood of the Country, and that his rights as an American Citizen are not dictated by the Bible or any holy book.

 S2 expressed his belief that gays are needed by the US and stated that they are hard-working and outstanding.

 S2 believes that homosexuals are hard working, dedicated and talented people that serve to sustain the country just as much as anyone else.

 S1 claims that the debate over same-sex marriage has nothing to do with marriage equality because allowing homosexuals to marry would require redefining the meaning of marriage which is unacceptable. He argues that marriage is an institution that was created to be a union between a man and a woman with the intention of creating children as part of stable nuclear families. He also suggests that homosexuals are abnormal and are trying to convince themselves that they are normal by changing the law to allow themselves to get married. S2 claims that redefining marriage might not be a bad idea and claims that preventing a homosexual from marrying the person of their choice is discrimination. He also suggests that S1's opinions do not match reality.

 S1 maintains a fundamental view of marriage as being between a man and a woman and as having been create to have children in a stable environment.  Gay marriage, S1 believes, would change the very nature of the marriage relationship, while merely providing gay men the ability to wear wedding rings and delude themselves that they are normal married people, although he concedes the latter part is only his opinion.  S2 argues that excluding gays from being able to marry the person of their choice is discrimination.  S1 argues that discrimination and equality are inappropriate terms because the very concept of marriage excludes homosexuals.  He regrets that more gay posters in the forum do not agree with him on the point.

 Two people are discussing gay marriage.  S1 states that it has nothing to do with marriage equality, but an attempt to redefine the meaning of marriage.  He wishes that the gay posters would be honest and not use words such as equality and discrimination where they don't apply, since marriage is an institution created to be a union between man and woman that leads to the creation of children.  He states that marriage has nothing to do with two people giving each other a wedding ring.  S2 retorts by questioning how it is not discrimination if he can't marry the person of his choice but a heterosexual can. He also states that Las Vegas itself refutes S1's arguments.

 S1 states that allowing gays to marry redefines the meaning of the word marriage because marriage was created to be union between a man and a woman that leads to child rearing within " a stable nuclear family". He further said this has nothing to do with gays. It has nothing to do with guys giving each other rings and kidding themselves that they are "normal like straight people. "
 S2  questioned S1 asking him why he believes that that redefining marriage is a bad thing. He then said that if he cannot marry who he wants but a straight person can, it is discrimination. He said that he could not define it as anything else. He said S1 was never in Los Vegas.

 S1 does not believe the argument has to do with marriage equality, and has everything to do with redefining the very meaning of marriage to allow homosexuals to marry. This person does not believe that equality and discrimination are valid opinions in support of homosexual marriage. They believe that marriage was instituted for the purpose of a stable nuclear family to procreate and that homosexuals have no place in such an institution. This person does not believe homosexuals to be normal, and believe that heterosexuality is normal.
 S2 argues that it is, in fact, discrimination, because they cannot marry the person of their choice, but a heterosexual person can. This person does not believe that this is equality, and that it is not fair to them.

 S1 suggests that politicians should be stoned in public as punishment for their deviant sexual behaviors. He cites the story of Fred Thompson, a politician who was married at 17 and fathered three children with his first wife. He was then divorced and remarried to a woman younger than his oldest child with whom he fathered two more children. It is unclear why this is relevant. He goes on to claim that Fred Thompson is a member of the Churches of Christ which is a religious cult and that he is not really a Christian. S2 jokes that if you stone someone in public you might be brought up on drug charges and wonders if people think Fred Thompson is simply pretending to be religious.

 S1 and S2 discuss several prominent individuals with respect to their sex lives.  S1 proposes that Vitter and Craig should be stoned to death along with Vitter's hooker and a gay partner of Craig's.  S2 jokes that stoning could draw drug charges.  S1 heaps opprobrium on Fred Thompson for having had a teenage pregnancy out of wedlock occur and then subsequent long term marriage and divorce.  He's critical of Thompson for having a second wife and young children at the age of 65, and for being only vaguely christian through identification as a member of Churches of Christ.  He notes James Dobson says Thompson is not really a christian, but it is clear neither S1 nor S2 respects Dobson either.

 Two people are discussing the sanctity of Christian marriage.  S1 expresses his wish that Vitter and Craig be stoned.  He then states a tale about a man named Fred Thompson who claims to be a member of the Churches of Christ.  He states that Fred married his pregnant girlfriend at 18 and were married for 26 years, having multiple children, until they divorced and he married a woman who is younger than his oldest child.  He then states that James Dobson says Fred is not really a Christian.  S2 questions if Dobson thinks the man is just acting, to which S1 retorts, asking if Dobson thinks period.  S2 states maybe about himself, but on issues its hard to say.

 S1 suggested stoning Vitter, his hooker, Craig and the man he was with on the Capitol steps. He talked about a "Christian man" who married young, had  children, divorced his first wife wife, married a  woman younger than his oldest child, and now, at the age of 65 has two very young children. This man says he is a member of the Churches of Christ but James Dobson says this man is not a Christian.
 In regards to the stoning comment, S2 with humor said that those who did stone people on the Capitol steps could get arrested on drug charges. He asked if Dobson thinks the man is pretending to be a Christian and said that he believes Dobson is mostly self serving.

 S1 believes that Vitter and Craig should be stones on the Capitol Steps as well as the people they slept with. This person states a hypocrisy with Fred Thompson, where he got his eighteen year old girlfriend, Sarah Lindsey, pregnant which prompted an immediate marriage that lasted for twenty-six years before a divorce was ordered. After remarrying, S1 points out that in addition to three children from the previous marriage, Thompson had two more with a woman who was younger than his oldest child. S1 states that James Dobson does not believe Thompson to be a true Christian. 
 S2 seems to partially agree with S1, though this person believes that a stoning would result in the arrest of those who perpetrated it on drug charges.

 S1 suggests that homosexuals can choose to ignore their sexual impulses which is different than a person controlling their ethnicity. He claims that if homosexuals do not have a choice about whether or not to engage in homosexual fornication, then they would be sexually assaulting people. 
 S2 suggests that homosexuals do not have a choice about who they are attracted to. He clarifies that he is referring to the lack of choice regarding sexual attraction, that being straight or gay is not a choice, rather than the choice regarding whether to engage in homosexual acts. In response to S1 claiming that homosexuals should not engage in "illicit gay sex," S2 asks if it is therefore appropriate for a homosexual to remain celibate their entire lives.

 S1 thinks that comparing homosexuals to black people is a bad argument because people are born black but gay people make a choice to have gay sex which he considers to be a sin. He thinks if it is not a choice then we should be on guard at shopping malls and street corners. The implication is people could be attacked if is isn't a choice. He views gay sex as a violation of the word of God. S2 laughs at the idea of homosexuality being a choice and says that he does not have a choice in being attracted to either males or females. He talks about sexual attraction verses the actual sex act. He rejects the idea gay people should be celibate forever.

 S1 and S2 are discussing gay issues.  S1 feels gay people make a choice to engage in sexual relations with members of the same sex.  S2 supports being gay is not a choice someone can make, but instead is how an individual is born.  S2 poses the question that if what S1 says is true, then he/she must also believe that gay people can choose the gender of those they are sexually attracted to.  S1 believes engaging in gay sex is a violation of God's word and is; therefore, a sin.  S2 then asks S1 if he/she believes in support of hisher theory that gay people should then be celibate forever so as to not offend God and "his word."

 S1 states that while a person may be born a certain color he  should be able to control his or her sexual behavior and not engage in "gay sex sin". S1 stated that if homosexuals cannot control this behavior, then public places are unsafe. He closed his comments by saying that homosexual sexual behavior is a choice and is against God's word.
 S2 pointed out that people who are gay were born that way.They did and do not have a choice about their sexual orientation. They either like girls or or they like guys and that it the way it is.
 He said that S1 believes that gay people should remain celibate all of their lives just because he doesn't approve of their behavior.

 S1 does not believe that their argument has anything to do relating to racial segregation. They believe that S2 has either misinterpreted their argument or is ignorant of what was actually argued. This person argues that because S1 cannot answer what they thought they were arguing, that they cannot truly validate their argument. They also argue that because of this, S2 cannot prove what they said was correct or incorrect. They state that their argument was not meant to be taken that the plight of homosexuals is nothing like the plight of racial minorities.
 S2 believes that S1's argument purports that racial segregation has no parallel to discrimination against homosexuals. They believe that every time prejudice, racism, sexism, anti-semitism or homophobia is challenged, the perpetrators always claim that it is nothing like the previous time but in truth it actually is without exception. This person believes that S1 is arguing that discrimination against homosexuals is different from discrimination against racial minorities. Eventually they realize that they may have been wrong and retract their statement and apologize.

 S1 states that "it is nothing like racial discrimination", in regards to discrimination against gays, and denies saying it. He does not feel that his post implied that the plight of gays is nothing like the plight of blacks. He asks why S2 would think that he implied that, and calls the assumption that he did wrong. Several times he accuses S2 of not knowing what he is talking about. He says that S2 has only succeeded in discrediting himself.
    S2 responds to S1 saying, "it is nothing like racial discrimination", with the argument that all segregation, throughout history, has been the same. That the perpetrators have used the same argument to support it, namely the claim that "this is nothing like the last" and that, without exception, it is. He contends that if S1 had not wanted to compare racial discrimination to discrimination against gays he miss-phrased his post, and asks S1 to explain himself. He accuses S1 of throwing a temper tantrum to validate his argument, and that the job of discrediting him is painfully easy.

 The text begins with S1 saying "It's nothing like racial segregation."  But the statement he was responding to is not mentioned in the text.  The statement he was responding to is also not from the other writer (S2), but from someone mentioned later as Addison.  S1 believes the other writer (S2) has misunderstood his comment to Addison.  He doesn't believe his words had anything to do with denying the current plight of gay people is similar to the past plight of black people. He believes the other writer is jumping to conclusions, possibly based on information in other posts.
 
 S1 is offended by the other writer's use of the phrase, "It's nothing like racial segregation."  He believes the words are about the possibility of segregating gay people.  He the words imply that the segregation of gay people would either be nothing like the past treatment of black people, or would be less wrong.  He believes segregation throughout history is always the same, but people always deny the similarities.  This includes segregation according to race, religion, or sexual orientation.  At one point, he admits he may have interpreted the other writer's words incorrectly.

 S1 makes the statement, 'It's nothing like racial segregation...' When questioned about this statement the speaker begins repeatedly asking what it was that he had contended. He claims that the other speaker has no idea what he meant by his statement and that he is just making unfounded assumptions. He insists that he made no position about what segregation means definitely. He insists further that he didn't imply the plight of blacks and gays were dissimilar.
 S2 argues with S1 about what he believes the speaker actually meant from his statement. His first point is adamantly made, that the segregation of blacks is in actuality just like the segregation that is faced by homosexuals. He insists that the prejudice that they face is just like the previous prejudices, that in their time were also seen as as 'different'. He also claims that the statement implies that if the segregation of blacks were imposed on homosexuals, that it would not be less wrong. He concedes his assumption was made in error yet he has discredited the speaker.

 S1 argues that banning same-sex marriage is nothing like racial segregation.

He argues that S2 does not understand the point he is trying to make, that S2 is simply wrong, and that S2 has only succeeded in discrediting himself.
 S2 rejects S1's claim that banning same-sex marriage is nothing like racial segregation. He argues that it is exactly like racial or any other type of segregation that has ever occurred. He suggests that whenever a discriminatory behavior like racism, sexism, anti-Semetism, or homophobia is challenged, the perpetrators claim it is not the same as previous instances, but that all instances of discrimination are inherently the same. He interprets S1's argument as implying that it would not be as bad if society treated homosexuals the same way they treated blacks in the past. He also attacks S1, claiming that personal attacks are not an effective method of validating an argument.

 S1 believes that there are more limits to marriage than just the limit to opposite sexes and that if you do not follow the rules you do not qualify for the benefits of marriage. They do not believe that just because there are rules, anyone is barred from the custom. They do not believe that homosexuals have the right to the changes they want when it comes to marriage as they argue that the rules are global and not unequal. They argue that racial inequality between African Americans and white Americans in which they cold not marry was unequal, but that the situation cannot be compared to homosexuals because they are dissimilar.
 S2 believes that S1 is wrong and that the argument for equality can apply to homosexuals as well, since heterosexual couples can marry while homosexual couples cannot. They believe that just as race criteria from marriage has been removed upon the grounds of being inappropriate and discriminatory, so should gender. They argue that because of the rules, heterosexual couples have benefits that homosexuals don't.

 S2 feels that the right to recognition of two people to form a couple is being unfairly denied homosexuals. That a heterosexual couple is allowed to make life decisions, file taxes and be covered under insurance jointly, inherit property, and more. He compares the ban on homosexual marriage to the former ban on interracial marriage, and feels that having gender as a qualifying factor for marriage is equal to using race as a factor. He calls the arguments against homosexual couple semantic, and feel that they are being denied rights because some people don't like the idea of them having sex.
    S1 denies the inequality of restrictions between homosexual and heterosexual couples and does not feel that they have the right to change this law. He denies that race and gender  are equivalent differences and says that there are no unshared barriers between hetero and homo sexual couples. He states that it is individuals that have rights not couples, and that no-one can marry; someone married, an animal, a minor, or a sibling. He uses evolution to validate the view that gay relationships have less meaning than straight relationships.

 S1 believes people are using some valid arguments for keeping homosexual couples from getting married, but he does not necessarily side with all of those arguments.  He suggests that couples of any kind, gay or straight, do not have rights.  Individuals are the ones who have rights, but those rights are limited by rules that cannot be changed just because somebody personally wants them changed.  For example, a person does not have the right to marry someone if they are already married, or someone who is a minor.  Further, he believes heterosexual couples can be viewed as more valid on an evolutionary basis.
 
 S2 does not believe there any valid arguments to keep homosexuals from marrying.  He believes the issue of gay marriage is no different than than of marriage between different races.  He also disagrees with the notion that only individuals have rights.  The gay marriage issue is largely about the rights of couples, including the right to visit one another in a hospital, the right to inherit from one another, and the right to file taxes jointly.  He also believes the true reason for people being against gay marriage is disapproval of gays having sex.

 S1 claims that because there are rules doesn't mean one group is barred from the custom. Argues that the denial of marriage between races as discrimination is not similar to argument based on gender. Based on the rules, the barriers of marriage are the same for both heterosexual and homosexual couples and therefore one group is not being discriminated against. Just as no one can marry someone that is already married, an animal, or a minor, there are rules. He concedes that there is nothing wrong with changing something that is commonly agreed upon as need changing, but as it's not the case, homosexuals cannot have a change just because they want it. 
 S2 is of the opinion that just like race was found to be a discriminatory qualifier for the criteria of marriage, so should a couple's gender be found discriminatory criteria also. He says that it is not just the custom that's denied, it's their rights as individuals in a relationship to obtain benefits, to visit in the hospital, or to purchase property together.

 S1 claims that homosexual couples are not eligible for marriage because there are rules for which relationships quality as a marriage and homosexual couples do not fall within those rules. He argues that this is the same as people being prevented from marrying someone who is already married, an animal, a minor, or a sibling. He claims that this is different from the previous rule limiting marriage to intraracial couples. He further argues that heterosexual relationships are more valid at the evolutionary level because they have a reproductive purpose. 
 S2 argues that gender should be removed as a criteria for marriage in the same way that race was because it is inappropriate and discriminatory. He claims that it is unfair for heterosexuals to be eligible for the benefits of marriage such as the ability to make important medical decisions, to cover each other under their insurance, to file taxes jointly, to purchase property together, to visit each other in the hospital, or to be a legal heir, when those same privileges are denied to homosexuals.

 S1 believes that homosexuality will be punished and believes that it is a sin. They believe that President Obama, who supports homosexual marriage and a repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act is just as at fault for doing so. This person does not believe that there is any solid proof that debunks the resurrection of Jesus Christ. This person does not believe that S2 has any evidence to support their argument that what they believe is untrue. This person calls for proof and believes that they have not received any. They believe it is their Christian duty to warn people of Hell and the consequences of their actions.
 S2 does not believe that there will be consequences in an afterlife for homosexuality and calls for proof that it will actually occur. They believe that those who believe in a Christian Hell simply do so to threaten people and have no grounds to base their claims upon. This person believes that S1 dodges the argument and refuses to answer questions with actual proof of their validity.

 S1 believes that all homosexuals are doomed to the fiery pits of hell, grouping them all together and calling them godless heathens. He is of the mind that it is his christian duty to inform them of this,as non of S1's brethren will. He feels that until some scholarly evidence is produced that refutes the resurrection of Christ, any non-believers are just noisy Christ deniers. He uses strong words, threats, and insults, to validate his argument, as well as a story on Fox news.
    S2 calls S1's entire argument into question, does not believe that he will be going to Hell, that it doesn't exist, and that there is no proof to the contrary. He feels that if proof of the resurrection of Christ existed it would have already been produced. He accuses S1 of dodging the argument and attempting to reverse the burden of proof, he calls this tactic pathetic  and uses Fox as proof of this point. He says that he does not think that insults and threats are an intelligent or useful form of debate.

 S1 believes that all unrepentant homosexuals will spend an eternity suffering in Hell after they die.  He repeatedly cites Christianity and the Gospels as sources of information that back him up in this belief.  He challenges the other writer to prove the Gospels are fiction and that Christ's resurrection is false.  Failure to do so means failure to disprove that homosexuals will suffer forever in Hell.  He also says that President Obama's involvement with gay rights proves that Obama has no spiritual credibility.
 
 S2 does not believe homosexuals will suffer forever in Hell after they die.  He does not believe proving his stance requires him to disprove the Gospels.  He suggests that whenever the other writer has no proof to offer, he relies on insults.  Further, he suggests the other writer's words and attitude are hypocritical in terms of Christian religious values.  In response to the President Obama reference, he focuses on the other writer's news source.  He doesn't believe Fox News is a credible news source, and sees its use as weakening the debate.

 S1 insists that all those supporting or belonging to the homosexual community are going against the teachings of God from the Bible. He labels S2 and others like him as heathens, warning them to immediately change their ways and recognize Christ's authority; or else, fall into the Pit. He provides a link to an article about Obama's gay-marriage stance calling it madness. He the resurrection of Christ cannot be disproved. He insists until the resurrection is 'busted' they remain whiners and deniers of Christ.
 S2 believes that the belief systems of Christianity are unfounded and demands to be shown evidence of God and other biblical assertions. He refers to Christian belief as fairytale and delusion. He ridicules S1 for his predictable debate style claiming that S1 lack of valuable argument is typical for all Christians when confronted with reality, thereby his position's validity is made for him. He insists that when confronted with the fact that as a Christian, belief must be accompany good deeds, S1 returns only insult and threats of eternal damnation.

 S1 claims that people who support same-sex marriage and all other godless heathens will go to hell for their beliefs and behaviors and that God's mercy is the only thing keeping them out of Hell at the present time. He argues that if S2 believes the Gospels are fiction, then it should be simple to provide evidence against the resurrection, but that this evidence is not available because the Bible is true. He further claims that President Obama is a spiritual imbecile for supporting same-sex marriage and attempting to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and that anyone who supports him is also a spiritual imbecile. 
 S2 accuses S1 of having poor rhetoric because he does not provide any evidence and resorts to using insults and threats and shifting the topic. He also attacks S1 for referencing Fox News as a source of information. He also points out that S1 claims he is going to Heaven because of his belief, but then cites several Bible verses suggesting that you must do more than just believe.

At least that's what this article suggests : Opponents of gay marriage use many of the same arguments as foes of interracial relationships did before Loving v . Virginia outlawed state bans on interracial marriage in 1967 , said law professor Kim Forde-Mazrui at a talk sponsored by the Center for the Study of Race and Law and Lambda Law Alliance Sept . 30 . http://www.law.virginia.edu/home2002...fall/forde.htm<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This is not relevant to my argument at all . I have mentioned nothing about religious beliefs or bible-thumping protests against homosexuality . I did not bring interacial marriage into the discussion because it does not apply . I'm not against interacial marriage as long as there's a man and a woman involved . I did not bring the silly argument about water fountains into the discussion . Separate-but-equal does apply in the sense that records of legally recognized couples would separate married couples from same-sex couples but would not justify any inequalities regarding their rights and privileges . Hospital visitation , inheritance and other things could be afforded both . I'm wondering if those who insist on same-sex couples being called " married " are not acting somewhat from self-imposed shame ... like you want to hide the fact that you are gay . My argument has thusfar been limited to the requirement to redefine several other words if we redefine " marriage " . It has nothing to do with homophobia which , by the way , I do not suffer from . I have some friends that are gay and they know how I feel about the word " marriage " . We remain friends . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I accept your argument at face value , although I will say that I believe that the majority of people who argue against gay marriage do so for religious or homophobe reasons . ( Again , I'm not saying you fall into these categories . ) Words get redefined all the time , and some of them are just as important as the word ' marriage ' . For example , the Iraq War is not technically a war -- congress never declared war . And this isn't just a semantic detail , either . Declaring war used to mean that congress committed , the president committed , and all the citizens made sacrifices for the cause . Now we initiate military operations , never declare war in order to allow political wiggle room , cut everyone's taxes , tell them to go shopping , and call it a war anyway . Now that's redefining a word . Substituting a Jack for a Jill on a marriage license seems pretty minor in comparison to me .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The invasion of Iraq was a resumption of warfare that ended in a cease fire . It was not technically a new war requiring all the congressional steps . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not to derail this thread -- we can talk about this more in the Politics section -- but the last time the US Congress declared war was for WWII . So the conflict in Iraq is not in fact a resumption of a prior declared war .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're technically correct . However , the Gulf War was approved by Congress whether it was a declared war or not . The Iraq War was a continuation of the same conflict after a cease fire . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I understand the Bush administration has made this argument , but I don't think it has a whole lot of merit . It was a different presidential administration and the reasons for the conflict were different -- to repel the invasion of Kuwait .

 S1 believes there is some merit in the comparison of arguments against interracial marriage and those against homosexual marriage. This person points out that many opponents of homosexual marriage use many of the same arguments those who opposed interracial marriage did. They also argue that those who oppose homosexual marriage do so for both religious and homophobic reasons. This person argues that the definition of words get frequently modified in some way and uses the example of the use of the word 'War' when referring to the Iraq War when Congress gave no official declaration of War. They argue that today a lot of military operations are automatically grouped under the word 'War'.
 S2 does not believe that using examples of interracial marriage protests has relevance to the argument over allowing homosexual marriage. They argue that any separate marriage provision for Homosexuals should be as inclusive as Heterosexual marriages, but that the two should remain separate from each other by definition. They do not believe that the definition of marriage should change to include homosexual couples.

 S1 seems to agree with the comparison between interracial marriage and same sex marriage, citing that many of the arguments against them are similar.  He believes that words can be redefined including the word marriage and uses war as an example.  He brings up the fact that war has not been declared since WWII but the country has been involved in war-like situations and typically these are referred to as war.  He sees this as being off topic but this debate ends up dominating the remaining part of the text.
 S2 does not agree that marriage should be redefined to include same sex couples.  He does not believe himself to be a homophobe and cites friendships with gay individuals to back up his claim.  His issue is not with rights or the actual relationships themselves, he believes in full rights for gay couples, but he does not believe that the relationships should be able to bear the label marriage because it is not between a man and woman.  When the topic changes to the use of the term war he does not disagree with S1 but gives information challenging previous statements.

 S1 argues that in spite of the vitriol employed, comparing interracial and gay marriage is a useful analogy. Opponents of gay marriage use similar arguments as those employed by opponents of interracial marriage. S2 argues that this comparison is irrelevant, he has not mentioned religion or interracial marriage in his opposition to gay marriage. In fact, none of the tropes associated with interracial marriage actually apply. He has instead argued that redefining marriage would require redefining several other cultural practices as well. He has also proposed that those seeking to enjoy same sex marriage are doing so out of some form of self-shame. S1 argues that words and associated cultural practices are redefined all the time, providing the example of "war" to illustrate his point. In comparison to these major re-definitions, redefining what constitutes a valid marriage seems minor in comparison. S2 brings up a counterpoint to S1's argument about war. S1 clarifies S2's argument about war to illustrate how S2's example is in accordance with S1's original statement. S1 stands by his previous counter-example.

 S1 cites an article by a law professor which notes that opponents of gay marriage use many of the same arguments that were used by opponents of interracial marriage.  S2 claims she supports interracial marriage, provided it is heterosexual, and notes that she has not made inapplicable separate but equal arguments suggested by the analogy.   She purports to have gay friends and to be sympathetic to gay rights and civil unions but opposes gay marriage on the grounds that it does not meet her understanding of the word marriage.  S1 points out that she is using form over substance, and that the meaning or definition of marriage can change over time, noting that the public universally accepts and refers to the Irag War, despite the fact that the U.S. never declared war against Iraq, or Viet Nam or Korea either.  He suggests accepting an undeclared war as a war does less violence to the meaning of the term war than substituting a Jack for a Jill on a marriage license does to the term marriage.

 S1 feels that Jim and MrWrite's argument has become a battle of insults, and that this is unfortunate, but that the comparison between the argument against gay marriage and that against interracial marriage is not baseless. He cites that opponents of gay marriage use many of the same arguments that were used to oppose interracial marriage, before that was outlawed. He believes that most opponents of gay marriage do so for religious or homophobic reasons. He argues that words get redefined on an ongoing basis, citing the word war being modified to suit political purposes. He does not believe that the justifications for the current war in Iraq have much merit, and that the same argument could be made for reentering Vietnam or Korea.
    S2 doesn't feel that interracial marriage and homosexual marriage have anything to do with each other. He feels that separate-but-equal would apply to the records of gay couples but wouldn't justify any restrictions of there rights or privileges as a couple. He preemptively denies being homophobic, citing his having gay friends who know what his views on the word marriage are. He does not feel that the Iraq War is technically a new war requiring all of the congressional steps, rather that it was merely a continuation of the Gulf War, or that the same arguments could be applied  to those other conflicts.

And before that you said ask any gay male and he'll tell you all about it . I'm right to assume you asked or talked to gay males about it in painstaking detail . This is obviously the crowd you hang out with . These are gay men who are very liberal in their sexual practices , maybe closeted , just looking to get their rocks off , and you're obviously right in the loop . I don't know why such an anti-gay , morally upstanding , righteous anti-gay Republican conservative such as yourself would have any interest in associating with such a scene . What would your wife think ? This is just a guess , she doesn't know ? You assumed I'd want to wear pink tights because I'm gay . That's not even clever or funny . <br><br><b>Summaries</b><br>

 S1 believes that the amount of homosexual encounters at rest stops is very high and that rest stops are closing down because of them. This person has not found a reasonable refutation of this fact in their eyes from any gay supporter. This person does not see any lack of moral character exhibited by people who are exercising their Constitutional Rights to deny the sanctity of marriage, to what they believe as immoral associations, by not allowing the definition of what they believe marriage to be to change.
 S2 believes there is a lack of moral character in those who vote away other people's rights. They use Proposition 8 as an example of this. They compare the example of illicit public sexual acts in rest stops between homosexuals to heterosexual men who also make it public that they do the same with heterosexual women in public places. This person somewhat agrees with S1 that exercising Constitutional Rights isn't morally objectionable, but using that as a platform to deny marriage rights to loving, committed homosexual couples is.

 S1 is focused on the sexual acts of gay men and places in which they happened.  Within the text it is hard to pick out some of the issues he refers to in passing including HIV and voting.  He is mostly focused on rest areas and glory holes as well as assuming that S2 has never been in a long term relationship like he currently is with his wife of 31 years.  He continues to make insulting comments towards gay men but claims they are not directed towards gay men, just S2.  He refers to someone as a murdering drunk, however it is unclear who he is referring to.
 S2 questions where S1 gets his information, having a hard time believing that gay men would open up to a man that he describes as "Mr. Anti Gay Conservative".  He accuses him of being gay on the downlow.  He brings up Pastor Ted Haggard twice, the second time mentioning meth in a comparison.  He brings up "Prop H 8" and the paranoia that surrounds homosexuality, making it easy for people to vote to lessen their rights.

 S1 argues that homosexuality is a disgusting habit. He uses certain sexual practices common in the gay community as evidence. Further, S1 argues that supporting gay rights shows the lack of moral character of supporters. S2 retorts that in fact opposing gay rights shows a lack of moral character and accuses S1 of in fact being in denial of his own homosexuality. He bases this accusation on S1's knowledge of aforementioned sexual practices and familiarity with gay cultural practices.  S1 argues that barring same sex marriage is an exercise of constitutional rights and that he has been happily committed to a heterosexual marriage for many years.  S2 argues that gay marriage was denied to married, loving gay couples and that being married to a woman is no indicator of one's true sexual preference. S2 argues that S1's familiarity with gay practices points to him possibly being in denial or hiding his true sexual preference.  S1's repeated mocking of S2, according to S2 does little to hide the evidence of S1's true nature or sexual preference.

 S2 and S1 have had numerous previous discussions about homosexuality and gay rights and S2 is sarcastically suggesting that S1, despite his professed and vocal conservative stance, is actually a closet homosexual who is hiding that fact from his wife of 31 years based on the fact that S1 purports to know so much about what gays would think, i.e.- he obtained that information from his relations with other gays while engaged in secret homosexual relationships.  In a similar dig, S1 suggests that S2 is a closet homosexual because he purports not to know about the gay community's frequent use of highway rest stops as places to hook up.  S1 believes it is an exercise of moral character to use the political process to prevent marriage from becoming bastardized.  S2 argues that recognition of loving committed gay marriage would not be bastardizing the institution of marriage.  The two feel they have similar understandings of references to Ted Haggard and Sartre and use the term gloryhole with a meaning that is not entirely clear from this dialog.

 S1 states that homosexual acts are very unappealing and immoral, and does not see any problem with denying the sanctity of marriage, to couples who engage in such behavior. He doubts whether S2 has ever had a lasting relationship, and states that he has been faithfully married for 31 years. He feels that there is a large amount of deviant activities taking place throughout the gay community, citing glory holes in highway restrooms (of which he says that any gay man will talk about if asked)  and a restroom on the I-75 highway being closed down due to gay encounters happening there.
    S2 feels that the sanctity of marriage has been denied to loving and committed couples due to americans paranoia over homosexuality, and that those who vote away the rights of others lack moral character. He doubts how S1 (as an outspoken,  straight and conservative man) would have came by his information, and states that S1 must hang out with a very sexually liberal gay crowd. He states his own confusion as to why S1 has any interest in the private lives of homosexuals and further questions whether S1's wife is aware of the interest.

' is hardly proof , that is beyond coincidence predicting that ' things will stay much the same as they are and natural events will occur as usual ' . Abortions an unwed couples seems to have pretty much nothing to do with the last line . As for minorities and the constitution , the majority can change the constitution or just ignore it . It is in the majorities interest to support and accept minorities because pretty much everyone falls within one of them and minorites still have a significant number of people , maybe not the most important but enough to swing power between forces competting over the majority .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The number of earthquales that have happened outside of Israel in the last 100 yrs is exponentially increased . Believe what you will . If you have a better understanding of love waxing cold I'd like to hear it . Obviously we don't have the smae understanding of the US government . Teh majority rules unless it violates the constitution . If you can point out how that isn't true then I'd be interested in being enlightened . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Unless you are a beleiver in a religion , then the whole Earthquake thing is irrelevant and if you are then this isn't the debate for you . I haven't been argued that homosexuality is right according to religious beleifs , but more often that your religious beleifs should have nothing to do with my life . Acceptance of homosexuality effecting plate tectonics ? Time to come back to the real world , even if it is true , why should you worship a being that is quite happy to destroy homes and kill people for becoming more tolerant but is quite happy with the famine and AIDS situation and doesn't get involved with politics ? The constitution is not magic , it has been changed because enough people wanted it done , if the majority wants to ignore or change a part of the consititution it will do .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>First opff Jake started this rel ; igious topic . Reread the posts I'm only refuting his assertions . I did not say homosexuality is the cause of anything religious only citing support against Jake's comments . Don't ever try to assume you know God's mentality . Most parents love their children but they raise them according to how they feel is best . According tro what they know . Why are some parents motivator and others discipliners ? That's my popint if the majority want it they will do it . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And I refute your refutations . You implied that the Earthquakes were not a natural thing and dinviinly caused Even if there is a god , any ' loving parent ' that kills some of its children to make a point , when they are fully capable of just changing the issue anyway is hardly deserving of worship . As for people changing , not only is that dubious anyway but not really proof of anything , there are alcoholics who recover and don't drink and that is definitely genetically influenced . You clearly have no real idea about the state of genetic research or how it works , we are nowhere near finding the purpose of everything . There doesn't appear to be one gene , but there is probably a combination that lead to a greater chance of being gay . @ Rev , Power of Attorney would be fine , but giving that there is already favouritism shown to some people , why should that favouritism be arteficailly restricted . In the interest of fairness it seems a lot easy to recognise a few more people in an existing group that abolishing it . Also not everyone shares your view on the purpose and role of a government<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No you refute your inferences No I didn't Who said God killed them ? For someoen that claims there is no God it's amazing how you're the expert now on the nature of God . i agree there is a disposition but that doesn't mean that they are genetically confined as the alcoholic isn't . So why draw the line at homosexuals ? Why not polygamists ? Why do homosexuals deserve the right and polygamists don't ? What merits do homosexuality bring that polygamy doesn't ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So that little peice of geological trivia was just that , and had nothing to do with this debate or any points whatsoever ? Perhaps some people are capable of thinking from another's point of view , if God is a loving parent I can't see how you can justify the view that anything lethal can be used as a punishment . I don't think you know how genetics works in this instance . Or do you think that the method of upbringing they have is purely responisble ? I don't really see any real problem with polygamy itself , but it would have to be watched a little more carefully perhaps as the cultures that practise polygamy tend to be less focused on equality between sexs . As long as you make sure that the marriages are still volentary for both partners and that any person is fully able to leave if they want to then I can't really see the problem . However it is a lot more complicated if you are looking from the benefits point of view with respect to inheritance and other aspects ( child support and suchlike ) but these are realitively minor points that would just have to be worked out if this type of marriage was to be recognised <br><br><b>Summaries</b><br>

 S1 argues that Biblical prophecy is not proof of America heading in the wrong direction from a religious perspective. S2 notes that the number of earthquakes seen in the last century have increased dramatically, providing evidence to the contrary. S1 argues that a pre-existing religious belief is necessary for any evidence regarding earthquakes to be relevant. S1 argues that religion should be excluded from determining the cause of common events. Further, if God is willing to cause earthquakes because people accept homosexuality but ignores greater tragedies, then God's ultimate benevolence is up for question. All that is required is that enough people want to accept homosexuality for such acceptance to be socially correct. S2 states that S1 is purposefully misunderstanding S2's statements and that God's motivations are ultimately unknowable. S2 argues that S1 is claiming to know the nature of homosexuality and God alike without being an expert on the situation. S2 then asks why gays should be considered acceptable but polygamists are not. S1 admits he sees no problems with polygamy being allowed either.

 S1 argues that the bible warning of wars and natural disasters is not viable proof nor an argument since wars and natural disasters will always happen. They believe that it is within the majority's best interest to look out for the minority, as the minority still has a great number of people. They state that they haven't been argued that religious beliefs condone homosexuality, but that religious beliefs shouldn't have anything to do with another person's individual life. They refute the idea that earthquakes are a divinely inspired event. They also believe that genetics has more to do with homosexuality and alcoholism than choice or upbringing.
 S2 believes that since the number of earthquakes have increased outside of Israel over the past one hundred years, that it is a sign of God's love waxing cold. They believe that the way the United States government works is through the majority until something is viewed as unconstitutional. They argue that genetics does not have anything to do with homosexuality since they also don't believe that alcoholism is genetic.

 S1 dominates the debate.  He is against using religion, specifically Biblical references in the conversation around gay marriage.  His first comment seems to be arguing against a previous mention of increased earthquakes and wars.  He also argues for the inclusion and support of minority issues despite the fact that we live in a majority rule state.  He argues that first, most people fall into some sort of minority classification and second the minorities are still large in number.  There is a change in the conversation about half way through to genetics in which compares sexuality to a predisposition for alcoholism.  In the end he feels marriage must be consensual and that any parties may be free to leave, whether it is traditional, homosexual or polygamy.
 S2 mostly argues the religious points, for example citing the increase in earthquakes outside of Israel in recent years though he mentions another name of who began the conversation around religion.  He questions why the debate remains around homosexuals and whether polygamists fall into similar categories in the genetic argument.

 S1 claims that the Biblical prophecy that there will be wars and earthquakes in the future is not valid proof, that it is merely a recognition that people and nature continue to behave in the same way as time progresses. He rejects the idea that earthquakes have any relationship to people's behavior. He also claims that although the majority has the power to change the constitution, it is still in their best interest to support and accept minorities because they are a significant portion of society capable of swinging power between parties. 
 S2 suggests that the number of earthquakes has increased in the past 100 years and that this is due to people's behavior. He claims that the majority is able to overrule the minorities as long as it does not violate the constitution. He rejects S1's comments about God's choice to kill people by drawing an analogy with different parenting styles, suggesting that people choose to raise their children in differently, so S1 should not be attempting to understand the reasons behind God's behaviors.

 S1 claims that abortions and unwed couples have nothing to do with wars and earthquakes frequencies. S2 claims that earthquakes have increased exponentially outside of Israel and that the majority makes what ever rules it likes. S1 claims that is a religious argument about the earthquakes and either doesn't apply or if you are religious this isn't the right place to discuss it. S1 claims that making this a religious argument is not needed. S2 claims that references to a loving parent not killing some of their children are wrong. S2 claims that S1 claimed earthquakes are not a natural occurrence. S2 refutes that he stated that. S1 and S2 go back and forth arguing about refuting each other's refutations and inferences. S1 claims that polygamists and so on will want marriage rights now as well after homosexuals. S2 refutes the slippery slope argument.

 S1 argues that main stream media is biased for Obama on the gay marriage issue. S2 states that every Republican presidential candidate is anti-gay marriage and pro-sodomy bans. According to S2, unlike the Republicans, Obama has refrained from attempting to make his personal opinion law. Further, he has done more for gay rights than any other president.S1 accuses S2 of fear mongering by misrepresenting the Republican stance on gay marriage. S2 accuses the Republican party of fascism and a zero-tolerance position regarding gay marriage. S1 accuses S2 of misrepresenting the nature of Republican opposition. S2 notes that the United States has a history of oppressing minorities, such as Native Americans and African Americans, which could be extended to include gay citizens. S1 notes that these are past not present US policies and unlikely to happen again. S2 is not so sure. S1 asks if S2's solution is to put a protection for gays in the US constitution. S2 proposes limiting religious influence upon society as a suitable means of providing protection for homosexuals in America.

 S1 does not believe that new laws will call for the imprisonment or execution of homosexual citizens in the United States. They believes that there is more danger of economic collapse under President Obama than those laws concerning the gay issues. They don't think that S2's fears are warranted and such extremes cannot happen again.
 S2 believes that every Republican candidate has stood on a platform that opposes gay rights, such as marriage and civil unions and wish to reinstate sodomy laws across the country. They argue that President Obama personally believes that marriage is between one man and one woman, but does not wish to push his personal beliefs into law and instead has supported marriage equality as much as he can. They argue that no president has done more for the homosexual community as President Obama. They argue that there is a legitimate danger of laws going too far and that imprisonment of homosexuals can happen as it was federally accepted in the past of different races such as the Native Americans and Japanese.

 S1 believes that the gay-rights movement, S2 in particular, are paranoid.  There is not much being said to support his argument, most of the conversation is dominated by S2.  He argues that economic issues are more likely to hurt those in the gay rights movement than any possible laws.
 S2 has concerns about the possibility of creating a true second class citizens of  the GLBTQ community.  He refers to President Obama of being the only politician to put his beliefs aside and support gay marriage.  He references past injustices to support his claims that it is possible that gays will be lawfully discriminated against.  He mentions Native Americans and the genocide they experienced; Japanese Americans and the internment camps; African Americans and past slavery.  He worries that history will be allowed to repeat itself in the form of discrimination of homosexuals and points out recent attempts at renewing sodomy laws by some politicians.  At the end he seems to be in favor of an amendment to the Constitution to protect gay rights.

 S1 references a Yahoo News article titled "On Gay Marriage, Media Gives Obama a Pass." He accuses S2 of being a fear-monger, claiming that it is absurd to claim that people are attempting to imprison or execute homosexuals in the United States and that the police are not currently attempting to prevent people from engaging in homosexual behaviors. 
 S2 claims that every republican presidential candidate in the previous election wanted to ban same-sex marriage and to persecute homosexuals by reinstating anti-sodomy laws. He mentions that although President Obama believes that marriage is between a man and a woman, he is not willing legislate based on his personal beliefs, so he has been a strong supporter of marriage equality, more so than any other president in US history. S2 accuses republicans of basing their legislation of personal beliefs and claims that the rights of homosexuals should be protects through a constitutional amendment that restricts religion's role in society in order to prevent future human rights atrocities like those that occurred to Native Americans and Japanese Americans.

 S1 liked an editorial about President Barrack Obama. S2 claims every Republican candidate wants gays to be in jail by reinstating anti-sodomy laws and gay marriage banned. He claims President Barrack Obama has done more for gays then any other president and that he will come out for full marriage equality but is not trying to impose his views on others as the Republicans are. S1 references S2 as fear-mongering and engaging in gay-pride politics. S2 references the Republicans as being like the brown shirts. S2 claims that Rick Perry supports a Ugandan law that would execute gays. S1 accuses S2 of paranoia. S2 references Japanese internment and killings of Native Americans by the military. S1 states that these events haven't happened since then. S2 that they could happen again. S1 make rude comments about the police not closing meat-markets or hook-up spots. S2 references that that has happened under this constitution and can again. S1 asks what he wants done, a change to the constitution. S2 says a limit to religions role in society.

 S1 states that the Republican Party is using "hot button" issues, such as gay marriage, to deflect attention from truly pressing and universal matters. S2 argues that it is in fact the Democratic Party that is emphasizing such issues while Republicans deal with these more central issues. S1 argues that in fact the Democrats have done better running the nation in trying times, while the Republican Party bases their opposition to gay marriage on cultivating fear and ignorance. S2 accuses S1 of revisionism by ignoring Republican contributions to balanced Federal budgets in spite of Democratic misinformation and manipulation of the legal system to promote gay marriage. S1 does not understand how the Democratic Party manipulated the judiciary in order to promote gay marriage. According to S1, if anyone is manipulating the system, it is the Republican Party who emphasize imposing morality at the expense of individual liberty. S2 argues that pro-gay marriage forces used a combination of Massachusetts marriages and the Fair Faith and Credit Clause to attempt to force universal acceptance of gay marriage.

This person believes that conservatives are attempting to change the constitution so that they can impose their religious views and deny rights to others.
 S2 argues that if the Democrats weren't pushing radical agendas, then Republicans wouldn't have to take action against them.

 S1 is in favor of marriage between homosexual couples.  Within his debate he brings up the Republican use of "hot-button" issues, insinuating that gay marriage is an issue used to divide and distract from other "bread and butter" issues, mentioning tax breaks for the rich and global warming.  He disagrees with decisions being made that affect private affairs including gay marriage and also mentions abortion.  He also brings up the issue of morality being a part of the conversation when one's morality and beliefs is not everyone else's.
 S2 believes that gay marriage is wrong because of the traditional role of marriage.  He claims that he does not care much about what people do in their own time but draws the line at allowing same sex marriage.  He accuses democrats and the left of pushing a radical agenda.  He specifically accuses the left of manipulating the system.  He ends with defending states' rights to not acknowledge gay marriage comparing it to the right of states to not acknowledge a driver's licence if not fitting into their requirements.

 S1 claims that republicans focus on "hot button" issues to take attention away from the important issues. He claims that republicans have made issues out of gay rights and abortion by pushing legislation to ban them. He also suggests that democrats are more fiscally responsible than republicans whose only interest is to provide tax breaks for the wealthy. He claims that republicans are so concerned about certain minorities receiving their constitutional rights that they are willing to change the constitution to prevent it. 
 S2 claims that the republicans are focusing on important issues such as social security, taxes, and terrorism, and that it is democrats who are pushing unimportant issues like abortion, marriage equality, and global warming. He suggests that if democrats hadn't been pushing such a radical agenda, then the republicans wouldn't have had to come out against their position. He also rejects the idea that the democrats are the more fiscally responsible party, claiming that the social engineering policies put in place by the democrats will prevent the budget from ever being balanced.

S2 claims that the left always claims Republicans want to starve the elderly and school children. S1 claims that the judges were doing there jobs and interpreting the constitution and claims that Republicans try to force religious rules on everyone. S2 wants marriage to not be messed with and states that its legal for different states to have different standards. S2 references driver licensing laws differing between states as evidence for his opinion.

Indeed , the state and federal laws on the issue are specifically directed against gay people . It is woefully disingenuous of you to pretend otherwise . Another case of malicious disingenuity . Not even you can take it seriously with a straight face that these laws don't exist because gay people insist on equal rights , and homophobes want to deny them .

Marriage restrictions based on age , sex , species , number of , capacity , and perhaps a few other things . If you want " equal protection " the way you define it then all of these restrictions ( short of capacity ) would have to be removed . Is this what you mean by equal protection ? There seems to be more that disagree with you but that is beside the point .

 S1 argues that state and federal laws on the issue of homosexual marriage are specifically directed against homosexuals. They believe that the courts are upholding equal protections and that those who oppose the rulings do so because of prejudice. They argue that equal protection under the law is a global blanket effect and cannot be argued to exclude certain groups. They argue that barring homosexuals from marrying each other serves as an obstacle in a homosexual's pursuit of life, liberty and happiness because they are forbidden to marry the person that they love. 
 S2 believes that it is illegitimate to argue that the constitution means one thing when it was never meant to in the first place. They believe that in order to get equal protection, that one would have to change the constitution to mean something completely different. They do not believe that homosexual marriage was in any part of the original meaning of equal protection. They argue that the 14th amendment wouldn't apply to homosexuals unless they were originally denied marriage as defined today.

 Two subjects are discussing the issue of gay marriage.  S1 is in favor of gay marriage while S2 is against it.  S2 feels if allowances are altered to allow gay marriage, then the other restrictions would need removed as well.  He also feels doing so would reduce moral judgment.  S1 disagrees advising the general consensus is that all people are entitled to equal rights except when they include gays.  S2 argues there is no document defining equal rights making S1's argument invalid.  S1 defends his original argument by saying the Constitution as it is defined right now prevents homosexuals from their rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  He also feels that supporting the rules remaining the same amounts to bigotry.  S2 argues this by stating his feelings that if laws were altered to allow gay marriage, they would also need to be altered to allow things such as incest marriages, challenging S1 to offer information to support why gay marriage laws should be passed; however, a ban remain on other such unions.

 S1: The court upholds equal protections, but not for gays in federal and state laws. Equal protection under the law is for all. There is no evidence in the constitution that equal protection does not extend to homosexuals. For gays, not being able to marry is an obstacle to their pursuit of life, liberty and happiness. Gay partnerships are not protected in the same way that heterosexual marriages are. Denying gay marriage means denying an equal right. 
 
 S2: Marriage is restricted by age, sex, species, number, capacity etc. If equal protection for gay marriage is desired, than these restrictions would have to be removed. The constitution would have to be changed. Gay marriage is not a part of the term "equal protection" in the constitution. The original understanding of the 14th amendment does not apply to gays unless they are denied marriage (as it is defined today) for being gay.

 D3
 ----------
 S1 cites court decisions upholding equal protections for people regardless of sexual orientation. He accuses S2 of claiming the courts are engaging in illegitimate judicial activism whenever they support equal rights for homosexuals. He argues that it is unconstitutional to prevent homosexuals from marrying because that would be restricting their pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness. He says that heterosexuals take the right to marry the person you love for granted and should extend the same right to people in homosexual relationships. 
 S2 reasserts his claim that it is illegitimate to misinterpret the original constitutional meaning of equal protection. He claims that true equality would require relaxing the marriage restrictions based on age and species, for example, which he suggests would be inappropriate. He claims that homosexuals are not being denied the right to marry because they are gay, but rather because the genders of the two people involved to not fit the criteria for marriage. He claims this demonstrates equality because two straight males or females would not be legally allowed to marry either.

 S1 Accuses S2 of using straw-men in arguments. States courts have supported equal protection. Claims S2 doesn't understand definition of equality, and of being maliciously disingenuous. S2 Denies use of straw-men, asks for their use to be pointed out. Denies original intent apply to gay marriage under equal protection due to lack of documentation. Asks why S1 doesn't answer question. References other limitations to marriage that exist. S1 Sarcastically calls self stupid for believing constitutional mention of equal protection applied to gays. S2 Questions existence of documentation that links equal protection to gays but not other groups. S1 Accuses S2 of bigotry and links denial of gay marriage to being a denial of "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness". S2 Accuses S1 of ignoring S2's points and instead insulting him. Accuses S1 of borderline breaking the rules of the forum. S1 States that the lack of equal protection is obvious to a blind-man, S2 is deliberately denying facts. S2 Questions why it is wrong to deny gay marriage but not to deny incestuous marriage.

I will make one point here . Heterosexual marriage is one of the most universal of all human institutions , found in almost all cultures ever existing . With a precedent like that , the question isn't , " Why Mr. Galton are you opposed to gay marriage ? " The question is how do you justify revolutionizing that ancient institution ? To me , heterosexual marriage is the Parthenon : ancient , beautiful , crumbling some of late , but it would be a tragedy to knock it down , clear it out , and put in a new building . You prove to me why that new building is so gotdamn necessary .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It is circular to say marriage has simply always been heterosexual , end of debate . No one is talking about knocking down marriage . Gay families want to enter into it , because they want their families strengthened and protected as heterosexual families have been strenghtened and protected . Gay families want into the institution because they want to be a positive influence on it , to support it and to shore it up , not because they desire to harm it . They are fighting to get into it , as some heterosexuals can't wait to get out of it . I can't see if it would make such a dramatic change just because the couple are the same sex . Also marriage in the U.S. and Canada falls under common-law . This is a " living law " meant to evolve with society , with much room for interpretation by judges . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You're gonna have to explain your circularity argument for us slow folks . And you're gonna have to back up your statement that gays as a group are really in their hearts conservatives , with a love of traditional institutions like marriage . I strongly suspect that you have some homosexuals who want the right to marriage for romantic reasons , some who want it for economic / legal privilege reasons , but also very many who want it so as to affirm that homosexuality is just as good as heterosexuality . It's the idea of we're just as good as you are , so we must be able to have everything you can have . For many , I suspect it is not a desire to adopt a more conservative lifestyle , but to make a point , and move the culture toward greater acceptance . This is a risky gamble to shove this down peoples ' throats as it may cause a backlash instead of greater legitimization of the lifestyle . Oh and you've got to be kidding me that gay marriage doesn't revolutionize marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Takes us back to where we started , assumes it absolutely must be and cannot be different or change . Sure , there are many who want acceptance from society , parents , friends , and that is a big reason why they marry , for gays or straights . If gays want their marriages to compete with heterosexual marriages , to prove gay marriages can be more successful , wouldn't that be good for the institution ? The old fashioned backlash argument is not a reason to not do something , and frankly is a little tired and worn-out in 2004 . Gays are just as good as you are . Is there a problem with gays believing and acting like they are just as good ? We don't have the strong sense of different gender roles we once had , so why is it such a revolutionary change ? I can't see that it has revolutionized the societies where it is in effect . It could have represented the next step in a very gradual continuation of acceptance that had been going on for a long time . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I am not arguing that heterosexual marriage must be as it has been or cannot be different . I am arguing that that revolutionizing such an important , ancient institution requires some heavy justification . People who have no respect for the past may not find my point compelling ; people who look to the past with deep respect and see in it old wisdom will find it compelling . I for one do not want to revolutionize an ancient institution I have great respect for , in order so the gay community can prove something . Tired argument ?! My god , how long have we been debating gay marriage ? Only four or five years ago in grad school , we were discussing how difficult it would be to see more and more rights to be extended to cohabiting gays couples , and we talked a little bit about gay civil unions . Marriage wasn't even on the damn table ! Homosexuality is an eccentricity ; in my mind it is not equal in value to heterosexuality . This is not an issue of how gays believe and act ; it is an issue of whether we are going to enshrine homosexual marriage as we do with heterosexual marriage . Gender , sexuality , and family organization are absolutely fundamental aspects of society -- always have been , always will be .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes , the hetero-only definition of marriage has been around a long time . However , simply because something is traditional does not make it just . Well that's how you see it because of your contempt for the gay community . You see it as " them " trying to step out of their lower place , or prove they are not lower than you and equal in value . Your last comment I've dealt with in this post , demonstrates that very well . Yes , the backlash threat is tired and boring . No one is listening anymore . Well , I remember people talking about marriage for gays and lesbians and their rights for much longer . Well , that says it all about where you are coming from . You believe homosexuals are human beings of lesser value . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I believe homosexual behavior is an eccentricity and not equal in value to heterosexuality . I was not referring to the value of persons ; I think homosexuals have as much intrinsic value as anyone else . I have contempt for no one . Your attempt to paint people who disagree with you as haters is unfair and a cheap debate tactic .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Homosexuals are persons who have homosexual behaviour . <br><b>S1:5-  </b>We are all sophisticated enough to separate behavior from person . I don't have to tell you that homosexuals are MUCH more than whom they prefer to sleep with .<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Yes , there is also homosexual orientation , which is part of the person's homosexual identity , and part of the person's homosexuality . The orientation leads to the behaviour . <br><br><b>Summaries</b><br>

 S1 argues that heterosexual marriage is one of the most universal of all human institutions, found in almost all cultures that have ever existed. They believe that the true question is proposing a justification in revolutionizing that ancient institution. They believe that there are groups of homosexuals who want to change marriage for various reasons, whether it be for romance, economic and legal reasons but also to affirm that homosexuality and heterosexuality are just as good as each other. They warn that there is a risk of backlash with this way of thinking. They believe that homosexuality is an eccentricity and is not equal in value to heterosexuality.
 S2 does not believe that homosexuals are attempting to destroy the idea of marriage but only wish to be included into it. They believe that homosexuals should be as accepted socially as heterosexuals and find it difficult to see a problem with homosexuals believing and acting as equals to heterosexuals. They believe that homosexuals want to have a positive influence on the institution of marriage, not destroy it.

 S1 and S2 are discussing the topic of gay marriage rights.  S1 states he is not exactly opposed to gay marriage but would like someone to give valid reasoning behind restructuring the basis of marriage since it's been the same since the beginning of time, comparing it to the Parthenon.  S2 feels it is circular to classify marriage as simply heterosexual.  He believes no one is attempting to take away the idea of marriage, just asking for homosexual couples to be included in the fray.  S1 disagrees with S2's statements that at the root, most homosexuals fighting for marriage rights are doing so on a conservative note.  He feels instead that the reasons are a "we are entitled to what you have" mentality.  S2 disagrees stating that while many do want acceptance from society, most want marriage for the basic reasons of marriage.  He also feels S1's arguments support the notion that laws should stay absolute and cannot be changed or altered.  S1 disagrees with this statement advising he simply wants the reasons supported.

 S1: Heterosexual marriage has existed in all cultures for a very long time. How can one justify revolutionizing an ancient institution? Some homosexuals want to marry for love or legal status, but many of them want to do it to prove that they are just as good as heterosexuals. Homosexuals want what heterosexuals have, and want to make the mainstream accept gay culture. Gay marriage is not a good enough justification for revolutionizing the institution of marriage. Homosexuality is an anomaly among man, is not equal with heterosexuality, and does not deserve marriage.
  
 S2: Gays want to marry so that their families can have the strength and protection that the institution of marriage provides. They have no interest in harming the tradition of heterosexual marriage. Gays want to marry as badly as heterosexuals want not to be married. Living laws are meant to evolve with society. Homosexuals are just as good as heterosexuals. Other societies have legal gay marriage and no revolutions have occurred. Just because something is traditional does not make it just.

 S1 claims that traditional, heterosexual marriage is a universal human institution existing in almost every culture across the Earth and compares traditional marriage to the Parthenon as an example of an ancient structure that is damaged but deserves to be preserved. He claims that some homosexual unions would occur simply to demonstrate that homosexuality is equal to heterosexuality and that it is acceptable. He argues that it is not totally unacceptable to revise the definition of marriage, but that there would need to be a very good reason to do so, and that homosexuality is simply an eccentricity that is not equal in value to heterosexuality. 
 
 S2 argues that claiming that marriage has always been heterosexual is circular logic. He asserts that legalizing homosexual marriage wouldn't damage heterosexual marriages, but it would allow homosexual couples to receive the rights and protections currently afforded only to heterosexual couples.  He argues that just because something is traditional does not guarantee that it is right. He points out that S1 admitted to believing homosexuals were of lesser value.

 S1 Compares heterosexual marriage Parthenon, asks why it should be torn down.  States heterosexual marriage is a universal institution. S2 States that marriage is a living institution and subject to change, that S1 is using circular logic. States it is a small change to law and gays want to strengthen their families. S1 Asserts gay marriage is a major change. Believes that gays want marriage to advance acceptability of gay life style or legal benefits. S2 Claims that acceptance has been ongoing and marriage is a small step, gays are as good as heterosexuals. References ongoing changes to gender roles. S1 Claims that gender, sexuality and family organization are fundamental aspects of society. Claims homosexuality is an eccentricity not equal to heterosexuality. S2 States that S1 thinks homosexuals are of lower value, that the existing definition was made by heterosexuals. S1 Denies homosexuals are of less value, objects to lifestyle not individuals. S2 Links individuals to the behavior. S1 States it is possible to make person/behavior distinction. S2 States that orientation leads to the behavior.

So please don't specualte anything until you knwo what we're talking about . All laws are based upon morals . So it is based upon the morals of the country whcih happen to be predominantly Christian . England was one of many countries . There is no new family structure that didn't exist before this country . My definition of negative effect is that the puposes for which something is created is hindered or compromises . By changing standards there is a harm to it's integrity . Intregrity is compromised when it isn't stable . Soemthing that changes all teh time loses that integrity like John Kerry on his views . Things must remain consistent to be integral . This argument has a flaw . That when there is guaranteed religous freedomw then we dont ' have equal rights . Everyone has equal rights in terms of believing . However behavior is regualted by the government . Therefore we can do anyting in the name of religion until it violates behavior that is acceptable by society .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Fine , so what if the government said people are free to ' believe ' in God , but any sign of them putting their belief into practice , such as going to church or even just praying in private was illegal ? Would that be acceptable ? After all it is just regulating behaviourA , not belief ? Your comparisons are ludicrous . All of these situations involve non-consensual acts either through lack of knowledge or involvement of minors . You cannot compare that to consensual acts between adults . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That probably wouldn't be acceptable to most people but it would be legal and equal . They don't allow religious practices of polygamy , animal or human sacrifices , body mutilation , and many other religious practices . So then we should allow prostitution , polygamy , human trafficking , drug trafficking , gambling , drug distribution , and all other consensual acts .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But they obviously wouldn't be equal , because a significant proportion of the population would be restricted from worshipping how they want in a for that hurts nobody . These elements mostly have links to crime over and above the act itself , that justifies restrictions . Homosexuality doesn't . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The poeple would be equal . The religions would not . Look at our country . Almost all Christian beleifs are legal and no other non-Christians Churches have almost all their legal beleifs . That's it ? Crime ? That's it . The criminal link ? So if they criminalized homosexuality then it would be okay to ban gay marriage . Homosexuality has links to crime too . Sodomy is a crime . Define harm becaue homosexuality is harmful according to many .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>This is not equality . You are using the letter of the law to twist the purpose of the law , and even then doing it using very shaky logic . Equality is about general concepts , not specifics . It is equality to say ' everyone is has the same right to worship who they want ' , it is not equality to say ' everyone has the same right to worship who we tell them to ' . That is equality within an unequal system , which cannot be counted . Can you re-phrase , I don't follow . No . As I said , those have strong links to criminal activity irrespective of the act itself being a crime . For example drug use has noted links to theft , the same just cannot be said for homosexuality . No it isn't . And even if it was , that has nothing to do with homosexuality anyway . Physical or psychological injury or damage . Homosexuality is therefore in no way harmful . And I have serous doubts about the ' many ' who say it is . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Equality is treating every person the same . However it does not mean treating every person's behavior the same . It does not mean treat every organization the same either . Everyone has the same rights . NOt every religous practice , ideology , or behavior get the same treatment . Teh people determine what is in the public's interest to protect and ban . It basically only the Christian practices that are completely legal . Islamic polgamy and other religons don't have their practices recognized as often as christianity . Homosexuality has strong links to sodomy . Also prostitution is legal in Nevada so shoudl all states be forced to allow taht behavior ? Insome states adults cann have sex wiht 14 - 16 yr olds in some cases . Should other states recognize that too ? Most serial killers of men and young boys were homosexuals . Sodomy is a crime do you wnat me to post it ? gynocologist , Gi specialists , and colon specialist have all stated the effects homosexual related activites . Also there is a higher risk of disease transmission among homosexual men so much so they are not allowed to donate blood for 5 yrs from their last activity . <br><br><b>Summaries</b><br>

 S1 believes that all laws are based on morals and that because the country of the United States is predominantly Christian, their laws will reflect those beliefs. They believe that by changing standards there is a harm to integrity. This person believes that everyone has equal rights in terms of religious beliefs, however behavior is regulated by government and as such society can only do anything in the name of religion until it violates behavior that is accepted by society. They argue that it is the people who determine what is in the public's best interest to protect and ban.
 S2 argues that if the government allowed for people to believe in God, but made it illegal to put their beliefs into practice, such as going to church or private prayer at home, that it would be similar to the situation with homosexuals being unable to marry, and thus inequality. This person argues that this would not be equality and that S1 is using the letter of the law to twist the purpose of the law.

 Two people are discussing the subject of gay marriage rights.  S1 is against gay marriage but adamantly states his objection is not based on religion but because there are laws prohibiting the practice.  S2 is in support of gay marriage and argues laws could also be passed to ban things such as worshiping God and begs the question of whether or not S1 would so adamantly support the laws he cites if that were the case.  S1 advises he would still support the law as there are already laws banning certain religious practices such as polygamy.  He advises that even though such a thing would most likely not happen, he would still support it because it would be fair and equal toward all.  S1 contends that if this were the case, crime rate would increase due to the banning of religious freedom, in a sense.  S1 believes homosexuality should be considered a crime because sodomy is a crime.  S2 feels S1 is distorting the law to justify homosexuals being discriminated against.  S1 denies this accusation.

 S1: All laws are based on morals - Christian morals, as the U.S. was founded as a Christian country. By changing family standards by allowing gay marriage, the integrity of heterosexual marriage and family structure is no longer stable.  Prostitution, polygamy, human trafficking, gambling and drug distribution are all "consensual acts" as gay relations claim to be; should these be legalized too? Homosexuality is linked to crime, and many consider homosexuality to be harmful. Equality means treating everyone the same, but not treating every behavior the same. The people will determine what is in the public's best interest to protect and ban.
 
 S2: What if belief in God was legally allowed, but worshiping in churches or even praying in private was illegal? A parallel to gay marriage - gay relations between two consenting adults is fine, but gay marriage is not. Acts like prostitution and drug trafficking are not equal exchanges, and are linked to crime; homosexuality is not. Equality means worshiping whomever you want, not what the majority believes is correct.

 S1 claims that laws are based on morals and because the United States is a predominantly Christian nation, the laws are going to be biased toward Christian beliefs. He asserts that homosexuality has negative consequences and harms the integrity of marriage. He argues that people have the right to believe freely, but that the government controls behavior, citing the freedom of religion until the practices do not conform to society's rules. He brings up the issue of equality, claiming that different religions are not actually equal even though the law says they should all be treated equally because although each of the religions has the same rights, they are still not all treated equally.
 S2 rejects S1's differentiation between the right to believe and the right to behave and says it is inappropriate to compare homosexuality to non-consensual behaviors. He claims that behaviors like drug trafficking and gambling have links to crime and should therefore be regulated, but that there is no reason to believe that homosexuality is harmful so it should not be controlled.

 S1 Denies bringing up religion, someone else did. States freedom of belief is law but rules govern actions. Also that changing something frequently weakens its integrity. S2 Denies validity of S1's earlier arguments, as referencing that were not between consensual adults. Questions if freedom of religion were allowed but expression limited. S1 States many religious practices such as polygamy are illegal and that many other consensual acts such as drug use as well. S2 States that other banned activities are linked to crime directly but homosexuality isn't. S1 States that if sodomy is illegal then homosexuality is a crime. States that the people are equal not the religions they follow. S2 Refutes S1, denies any link between homosexuality and crime. Cites difference between the letter and intent of the law.  S1 States that equality is treating everybody the same, not every behavior. The people determine what is in the public's interest. States differences between state laws with prostitution, age of consent and references physical effects reported by doctors of homosexuality also links to serial killers.

All the protesting in the world wouldn't have brought it about if the will of the people were not changing to make it happen . At the end of the day , any legislative movement needs the will of the people to be successful . It may not need a full majority in some cases , but it needs enough people on board . That's why legislation requires not only voting ( by legislature ) , but elected officials to do so as well . There was a process our country went through on those issues as whether or not they were legitimate in terms of the law -- it involved a national debate , protests , etc. Sometimes this process results in our country ( the people ) granting civil rights legislation , and sometimes it doesn't ( depending on whether it is deemed warranted ) . The process ( which will undoubtedly take years ) is going on right now in regards to gays . Time will tell what the result will be . Any form of legislation is a voting matter . That's the way our system works .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why is it that whenever this comes up you insist on conflating " the people voting on a law " with " the legislature voting on a law " or " the people electing politicians " ?

Or at least try to , and hope someone doesn't derail the conversation into irrelevant issues like how the legislature works . I will echo the point that several have made here . The idea of allowing the masses to determine civil rights is stupid and wrong . If a group's civil rights need protecting , then they need protecting from the very masses that are doing the voting . Ballot measures may be a legal process , but that doesn't prevent them from being stupid and wrong , now does it ? That's the point that's trying to be made here . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well , that's up to you . If you don't want to derail it , you don't have to . It seems to me that what is really happening in society with these ballot initiatives and other parts of the process is determining whether or not it is a civil right in the first place to give legal marriage to whatever group arrangement is in question . ( In this case , gays couples . ) That process has to take place ; it is just not feasible in our society to give marriage equality to any group of any arrangement that comes along demanding it until we determine for certain that it needs to be done . If society determines that same-sex arrangements of two people should suffice to redefine marriage for it to be included , then so be it . But that process has to be there in some form , realistically . If you are going to draw the line in terms of what can be voted on a ballot initiative or not , what authority determines that ? How are you going to determine where that line is drawn ? And you can't just arbitrarily say " when civil rights are being infringed " because that doesn't carry any legal weight -- it's opinion . Just saying it's " stupid " and " wrong " may be your point being made , but it's a point that doesn't offer any solutions .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You really are a piece of work . All you're saying here is that if society wants to be bigoted it should be allowed to be . Very libertarian of you , but I believe that if the power of the government can be used to fight evil and prejudice , it should . If wrong is happening , and the government can stop it , it should . You will of course claim that the government can't do anything , but history has proven that position wrong . The government has taken stands against biggotry before , and while it hasn't eradicated it , it has improved things . Gee , now I'm supposed to offer solutions before you even get what the point is ? I'm I allowed to use both hands while I type ? Any other restrictions you want to add ? <br><br><b>Summaries</b><br>

 S1 replies to Matthew (who had asked about voting on his civil rights), that there are legal and legislative processes that need to take place to determine civil rights, that legislators, elected officials, and the people of our country all are required to vote for change to take place. He notes that this process has happened before and that protesting had made a difference, but not until enough people had gotten on board with the issue. He feels that this process has to be there in some form to determine the status of civil rights and how those rights are expressed.
    S2 feels that by explaining how legislation works in this country S1 has moved the topic away from the question Matthew had asked. He does not feel that the people voting on laws, legislators voting on laws, or the people electing politicians, are the same thing. He takes issue with S1 derailing the topic away from the question. He takes further issue with the idea that the masses should be allowed to vote on civil rights issues, calling this stupid and wrong. He feels that if a group's civil rights need protecting, then they need protecting from the group doing the voting. He believes that if the power of the government can be used to fight evil and prejudice than it should be.

 S1 feels that issues involving legislative movements are decided by society. Though the legislature votes on national issues, the power of the citizens is what grants or denies civil rights legislation. He feels the hot issue right now involves gay marriage, and the outcome of that issue will be a voting matter. According to him, society determines its own standards and it is not possible to make gay marriage civil rights matter. Legal marriage cannot just be handed out to any group that calls for it; society determines the facts and acts reasonably and accordingly to the facts given about the issue.
 
 S2 feels that civil rights issues should not be left up to society, especially if that society is the main deterrent in approving a group's rights.  He states that the government should be the force behind protecting citizens' rights against the hatred and bigotry of the masses. The government has involved itself in civil rights issues in the past, and should step up to defend gay rights when it comes to legal marriage.

 S1 claims that any legislative movement requires the support of the people to be successful. He suggests that the legal decisions about important issues involve not just the legislature, but national debates and protests. He argues that this same process is now occurring over gay rights and that people voting on laws is how the legal system works in order to allow society to determine its own standards. He claims that there is no problem with marriage being redefined to include same-sex couples, but that this change of definition must occur through the official process. 
 S2 accuses S1 of shifting off topic to the voting process and how the legislature works, claiming that the legal intricacies are irrelevant. He claims that allowing the general public to determine civil rights is wrong and that if a group needs protecting it is the government's job to do so, citing instances in the past where the government has taken a stand against bigotry. He argues that just because something is currently legal doesn't mean that it isn't wrong.

 S1 believes that protesting made a difference, but not until enough people had grouped together to voice their opinion. They point out that despite protesting, change would not be brought about unless the will of the people was not desiring that change. They believe this is how the system works, and any legislation is a matter of voters and the will of elected officials to reflect what the voters desire. They believe that the true reason behind the ballot initiatives is to determine whether or not it is a civil right in the first place to give legal marriage to whatever group arrangement is in question.
 S2 believes that there is a difference between voters voting on laws and legislators voting on laws. They do not believe that it is a good thing to allow the majority vote on civil rights issues because if a minority needs protecting, it will need protection most from the majority that is trying their best to keep them down. They do not believe society should be allowed to be bigoted.

 S1 and S2 are discussing the political processes that may lead to gay marriage.  S2 is of the opinion that society and government failure to recognize gay marriage and provide it equal protection is a civil rights violation being carried out against a minority group, implicitly suggesting that it should be protected under the Constitution by the Courts.  S1 on the other hand believes the issue is one that needs to spend time in the public awareness and consideration and be realized over time in the results of various political processes such as election results, initiatives in State legislatures and ballot initiatives.  S2 complains that this is obfuscation and an attempt by S1 to avoid the rights violation issue.  S2 disagrees and notes that just calling something a violation or stupid or wrong doesn't advance the process, and defies S1 to draw appropriate lines on where to draw the line, such as with regard to protection of other less acceptable group intimate relationships.  S2 asserts that the government has protected minorities against bigotry in the past.

Ohio passed a Gay marriage amendment and the silent majority spoke there as they did through out the U.S. re electing President Bush by 3 million a bigger margin then " Slick Willie " ever got .........<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This statement seems incorrect in too many ways for me to let it stand . First , to assume that the majority of people in Ohio were either silent about their views on same-sex marriage or on their choice for president is utter nonsense . They were absolutely as loud-mouthed about it as anyone else . Your implications that there is some " silent majority " imply a misunderstanding of the political battlefield , and I hope I have been able to clear it up . Next , although Bush won by a larger margin than Bill Clinton ( who you term " slick Willie " for no other reason than to anger and insult his supporters , I assume ? ) , this does not mean that Clinton did not win by a larger percentage . Remember that population increases over time , and there was a slightly higher voter turnout in this election due to its controversy . Even though Bush by a large number of voters compared to previous elections , he won by a marginal percentage due to the fact that the population of the US has increased . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Actually the population growth has nothing to do with the margin of victory ... I am talking about the votes President Bush won by and " Slick Willie " did not even get a 50 percent majority in either the 1992 and the 1996 election ......... He was very lucky that Perot ran in 1992 otherwise Bush would have defeated him ....... I am sure you have heard the term silent majority before ......... These are the people that when they vote make all the polls that the left wing media put out like the presidents approval rating is down or how bad the economy is or how bad the war in Iraq is going .......... If you think that morals and the gay marriage issue had no bearing in the president winning Ohio then you are living in a state of denial my friend ........<br><b> S2:2-  </b>In 2000 , Gore had 48.4% of the popular vote , while Bush had 47.9% . That gives Bush a negative . 5% in popular vote . In 2004 , Bush had 51% of the popular vote while Kerry had 48.1% . That gives Bush a victory by 2.9% of the popular vote . In comparison , Clinton in 1992 had 43% of the vote while Bush Sr. had 37.4% of the vote , which gives Clinton a win by 5.6% . In 1996 , Dole had 40.7% of the vote while Clinton had 49.2% of the vote , which gives Clinton the win by 8.5% . Clinton clearly had far greater victories than Bush ever did , the difference was that there was a competent third candidate running in both of Clinton's wins . http://mediamatters.org/items/200411150007 I have heard the term silent majority in the past , but it cannot refer to a majority which was not silent . The majority in Ohio ( and all of those other 11 states ) was in fact very , very vocal . Every poll was accurate . The term " silent majority " is not appropriate . I have no doubt that majority's desire to oppress the minority did play some factor in Bush's win in Ohio , but statistics suggest that it was a very small part . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Just for your information getting a majority of the vote means over 50 percent ........ Why was Kerry so sure he was going to win Ohio ? It is becasue the silent majority stood up big time ...........<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I did not say that this is not what the majority means .

 S1 feels that there is a silent majority of people who appose gay marriage, and that they have spoken in the polls by electing Bush and not Kerry for president. He uses the argument that Bush had a wider margin of victory over Kerry than Clinton had in either of his elections. He notes that Ohio passed a Gay Marriage amendment and then elected Kerry was smashed in the Ohio presidential election, and credits this to the silent majority. He states that It is the silent majority that make the polls used by the left wing media indicating that the presidents approval rating is down, the economy is bad, the war in Iraq is going badly. He feels that morals and the gay marriage issue played a large role in the presidents victory.
    S2 states that the people of Ohio were equally as vocal about their views on gay marriage and their choice for president as any one else, and are therefore not a silent majority. He notes that while Clinton won by fewer total votes, he carried a larger percentage of votes, and therefore had a greater amount of support than Bush. He feels that due to the polls being accurate going into the election the term silent majority does not apply. While he notes that the majority's desire to suppress the minority likely played a  role in Bush's victory, polls suggest that in was a very small role.

 S1 feels that the silent majority in Ohio spoke out about the issue of the state's passing of a gay rights amendment, and compares it to the large percentage of voters in past presidential elections. He believes that the morals and beliefs in the state were the reasons for the Republican presidential candidate, George Bush, winning by a larger percentage than either democratic candidate, John Kerry and Bill Clinton, in the past elections. 
 
 S2 rebuts that the majority of people in Ohio were not silent about their views on gay marriage or on their choice for president; the people in that state were very vocal about their views. He states that Bush did win by a larger percentage than Clinton, the increase in population was the determining factor for those numbers. He feels that majority's desire to oppress the minority, in Ohio, did play some factor in Bush's win. He uses percentages from various candidates, likeClinton, Bush, Dole, Kerry and Gore to back up his argument. He disagrees that Bush was more supported than Clinton.

 S1 notes that although John Kerry was expected to win the election in Ohio, he lost. He attributes this loss to the disapproval of homosexuality by Ohioans, as indicated by the passing of a gay marriage amendment and their support for President Bush who he claims won by a larger margin than President Clinton. S2 rejects the claim that the people of Ohio were silent about their views of same-sex marriage and claims that although President Bush won with a larger margin, President Clinton still won by a larger percentage, due to the increased population and larger voter turnout in President Bush's election. S1 claims that population is irrelevant, citing several statistics showing a low level of support for President Clinton, and also claims that the same-sex marriage issue definitely had an effect on the outcome of the Ohio election. S2 again responds with statistics showing that President Clinton won by larger percentages than President Bush. He does not deny that the same-sex marriage issue was relevant, but denies that there was a silent majority.

 S1 believes that since Ohio passed a Gay Marriage amendment, it was the silent majority speaking the same as when President Bush was re-elected by a large margin. This person believes that morals and homosexual marriage had a large bearing on the election's eventual outcome. S1 believes that because of the silent majority, Kerry was confident in his victory in the polls in Ohio, when in fact he did not win in that state.
 S2 does not believe that the voters of Ohio were silent in any manner regarding the issue of homosexual marriage or their choice for president. S2 believes that even though Bush won by a larger margin than Bill Clinton, it doesn't mean that Clinton did not win by a larger percentage. This person believes that population increases and higher voter turnout is what won President Bush the election. They explain that despite percentages being relatively low for the two primary candidates during President Clinton's election periods, the difference in the elections was that there was a competent third party running in both.

 S1 believes in a conservative silent majority that negates liberal or left polling and votes in a politically correct and like minded conservative fashion in order to defeat liberal agendas such as gay marriage.  S2 doesn't think the conservatives are silent and they both cite various election results from the past to debate the premise that there is a silent conservative majority.  S2 doesn't believe there is a silent conservative majority and offers statistics to suggest that President Clinton was better supported by the electorate than President George W. Bush.  S1 is clearly a republican and repeatedly refers to President Clinton as "Slick Willie", whereas S2 is somewhat more guarded about his party affiliation in an apparent attempt to argue the matter from a point of neutrality, both asserting Clinton's superior level of support over Bush, and simultaneously implying that he, S2, is not a Clinton supporter.  S1 argues that Kerry expected to win Ohio and that the silent majority surprised him.  S2 replies that Kerry wasn't so sure he was going to win Ohio.

What makes my family any different and less deserving of equal protections including marriage than any other families ? We have two parents and will be the parents of two children with full custody . Please if you can describe to me what makes my family less deserving of the full protections given to that of heterosexual headed households and what makes us different besides the fact that one of us is not a woman ( is that better ) .

No one is asking for YOU to care for my children as I have all the same taxes and other responsiblities to my government as you do . Please try to answer my question as to why my family is less deserving of government benefits than a heterosexual headed household . <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Depends on your circumstances .

Are you more deserving than a single parent that deliberately has a clutch of children then moans because of lack of government support ?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>With full civil marriage equality , a whole host of benefits are brought about to strengthen my family such as survivors benefits for social security as just one example .

These of course are only a couple of the more than a thousand benefits marriage brings about . Certainly , you may argue that contracts drawn by a paid attorney or myself could reap these same benefits , but I do not understand what legitimate reason my family must jump through these hoops when heterosexual headed households are not required , asked or even expected to do the same . Two parents , two children , participating and supporting equally with our governments requirements as any other family , however receiving no reciprocation from the government to strengthen and protect my famly as It does heterosexual headed families .

In a modern secular society there is no reason not to extend marriage to other forms of relationships .

I cannot see why marriage should be granted to you but an incestuous relationship be illegal . Making homosexual sex legal is a far cry to making gay relationships officially equal to hetero ones .

I dont see why gays should have their relationships officialised ( is that a word ? ) and pull up the ladder so other types of relationships cannot follow . Before gay marriage is allowed then all types of sexual relationships should be considered . Lets face it , it would be far harder for people to accept a complete revolution in what we consider to be an appropriate relationship to become an official family than to just allow gays to do it ... using the very arguments that gays have to justify them officially marrying we can justify most other type of marriage .

 S1 believes that gay couples, and their rights in regard to marriage, are no different than other deviant relationships, such as incestuous and polygamous relationships. He does not feel that gay marriage should be prohibited, rather that it is simply different than a normal heterosexual marriage, and to recognize this difference is not discrimination. He feels that if gay relationships were to be allowed then not extending the same benefits to all forms of relationships between consenting adults would then be discriminatory. He feels that gay couples who have children through surrogates have outsourced their children, and he should therefore not be responsible for them.
    S2 makes the case that he has been with his partner for 15 years, and will be having his own biological children soon. He feels that his family should be afforded the same rights as a heterosexual couple, that his husband should gain automatic custody if he dies, survivor benefits from social security, and others. He does not see his relationship with his husband as being the same as other forms of non-sanctioned relationships, and that each new form of marriage arrangements would need to be argued on their own merits individually.

 S1 believes that gay marriages should not be viewed the same way as heterosexual marriages; the speaker does state that he does not disagree with the idea of gay marriage. He says that gay marriage is a deviation from the traditional union between a man and woman. Any sexual relationship that is a deviation from the "norm," like polygamist and incestuous relationships, should also be granted the same rights. The speaker feels that these relationships are all on the same levels, and one should not be afforded rights that the others are not.
 
 S2 identifies as a gay male, who has been in a 15-year-long homosexual relationship, and has a set of twins due soon; he feels his family should be granted the same rights as a heterosexual, married couple. He states that legalizing gay marriage allows for automatic guardianship of children if something happens to the biological parent, and also awards survivors benefits from social security. He believes that other types of marriage should be looked at based on its own situations and conditions.

 S1 states that same-sex marriage should not be prohibited, but believes that a homosexual marriage is different than a heterosexual marriage. He argues that recognizing this difference is not discrimination. He claims that children of same-sex couples or comparable to children from incestuous, polygamous, or other sexual deviant relationships. He makes the argument that if same-sex marriages are legalized, then all types of marriages between consenting adults should be legalized. He claims that the arguments in favor of same-sex marriage would work equally well for incestuous or polygamous relationships.
 S2 identifies himself as a homosexual and argues that same-sex families deserve the same benefits as heterosexual families. He questions what difference exists that distinguishes his relationship from that of a heterosexual couple other than the genitals involved. He identifies a variety of benefits received only through marriage, such as social security and guardianship among others. He takes offense at S1's comment that his children are "outsourced" and rejects the idea that homosexuals are fighting for marriage equality simply because they free handouts from the government.

 S1 believes that homosexual marriages should not be prohibited, but also believes that heterosexual marriages and homosexual marriages are not the same. They believe that if homosexuals are allowed to marry, than any kind of marriage between consenting adults should be allowed, otherwise you are discriminating against the person wanting to enter into the marriage. They believe that S2 deserves as much protection as an incestuous or polygamous relationship that has children. Overall, they believe that if homosexual marriages are allowed then it should branch out to other types of potential marriages.
 S2 points out that with full civil marriage equality, benefits otherwise not available to homosexual couples are now options such as survivor's benefits of social security or retained guardianship of their children. They don't see a reason for homosexual couples to have to go through a different process than heterosexuals in order to gain the same benefits of heterosexual marriage. Since S2 has children, they do not believe that they are any less deserving of government benefits of marriage than heterosexual couples with children.

 S1 argues that allowing gay marriage would set a precedent that would be used to allow marriage for other forms of traditionally socially unacceptable intimate or sexual relationships, such as incest between half brothers or a mother and son, and/or polygamy.  S2 is in a 15 year male homosexual relationship and is anticipating twin children that are biologically related to him.  He challenges S1 to explain why he and his family should not be entitled to the many benefits associated with marriage, such as social security surviver status.  S1 provides a putative explanation by noting that his children are outsourced, meaning that one of the parents of the children is not part of the family intended to receive the benefits of marriage.  S1 also notes that others do not qualify, and likens S2 to a single mother who has many children and then complains about not enough help from the government.  S1 repeatedly compares gay relationships to other types of relationships which he considers to be devious in order to justify excluding gays from marriage rights.

You've been very vocal that if anyone gets marriage benefits when you do not then it must be unconstitutional .

 S1 Claims never argued stance based upon religion, that would be arbitrary. Claims argument is based upon biology. S2 Claims argument on biology void, references age difference. S1 Claims debate is really about benefits not marriage itself. Claims heterosexual marriage is based on biology even if reproduction is impossible. S2 Wants equality, claims constitutionality. S1 Refers to S2s arguments about benefits. S2 Claims to have been commenting for years. S1 Doesn't care, accuses S2 of hypocrisy. S2 Refers to heterosexuals that can't breed, or won't, can still get married. S1 Refers to S2 having legal marriage in one state and not others as will of the people. Again refers to the demand being about benefits. S2 Asks why gays should be different. S1 Says that the idea of homosexuals and heterosexuals are the same is political fiction. Claims that being gay is like being left-handed, it's too bad that the world is made for right handed heterosexuals. Because you want something doesn't mean it's your right. Claims it's ignorant, insulting & arrogant to believe that.

 S1 believes that everyone should live within the bounds of the laws of society. They are free to be changed but not broken. Society's definition of marriage is not based merely on religion, but on biology. S2 argues that people who are not able to reproduce but can marry invalidates S1's argument. S1 reiterates that the ultimate intended goal of marriage is to make reproduction easier. Bringing up exceptions to does not change anything. S1 argues that S2's opposition to gay marriage bans stems from not receiving benefits that a married couple does. S2 argues that gay marriage bans are unequal and unjust. S2 emphasizes universal equality and desires to be treated just as heterosexual people who do not reproduce are in terms of the ability to marry.  S1 argues that by placing marriage law in the realm of the states, then the states can determine which type of marriage to recognize. S2 argues that even if this were the case, it would still be unjust. S1 argues that S2 ignores the biological differences involved.

 S1 sees marriage as it is today as part of a social contract that is based upon biology and reproduction.  The drive to reproduce is part of the heterosexual bond and marriage is its formalization.  S1 is annoyed with S2 demanding that because his marriage is not universally recognized that there is something unconstitutional in place.  He explains that marriage is left to the States to determine what is legal and that the Federal government, according to the Constitution, has no place to change that.
 S2 would like to see a change in the definition of marriage.  He holds a marriage licence but it is not universally recognized. He argues that biology and reproduction do not apply when people past the age where childbearing is possible can marry.  He challenges S1 that if marriage truly is about reproduction and family that a married couple must prove that this is a part of their relationship or their marriage would be terminated.  He is offended that others' beliefs can play a role in his life.

 S1 argues that is important that a society lives by its laws. They argue that a heterosexual marriage is a formalization of the need to reproduce. They do not believe that the Constitution requires a state to recognize another state's laws because it is up to the states what is recognized and what is not. They argue that heterosexuals and homosexuals are biologically different and that some people just have to deal with the ramifications of being biologically different. 
 S2 argues against the idea of marriage being solely for reproduction by bringing up the fact that heterosexuals who are well past birthing age can legally get married without any consequence. They argue that it is unfair that even though they may have a legal grounds and license to prove that they are married in one state, if they go to another state that does not recognize that license then that marriage is not accepted. This person believes that it should be up to the federal government and not the state government to recognize a marriage license.

 S1 believes that marriage, in it's conception, was made for biological reasons, that marriage exists to allow children to be born more easily. Although this should, in no way force people to have children, or their being capable of having children in the first place make a difference. S1 says that heterosexuals and homosexualsare fundamentally different, and that that difference is why they are treated differently. S1 compares the institution of marriage to the world being built to accommodate right handed people, and is insulted that the world should be forced to be changed for lefties, not believing they have that right. 
     S2 feels that, the federal government and other states, not recognizing his marriage license, is unconstitutional, as Iowa issues the same license for both hetero- and homosexual couples. He feels that there is no difference between a gay couple getting married, and a 70 year old straight couple getting married. He wants equal right to get married, and have that marriage recognized, as couples who either can't have children or choose not to.

Love and reproduction are implied . The legal meaning of marriage is , in most States , a contract between two people who are not under the age of consent , of different genders , of the same species , not closely related and who are not already married . Homosexuals are not a part of the traditional or cultural meaning of marriage . In order to be included , the meaning of marriage would have to change . The catch-22 is that homosexual couples want to be included in the current meaning of marriage , but what gives marriage meaning specifically excludes homosexual couples .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That's your definition . It is certainly not my definition . You don't speak for all of society . I personally define marriage as a union of two people who love one another and wish to make a commitment to one another . If marriage is about reproduction , why does nobody bat an eye when a 65 year old woman marries a 68 year old man ? If you believe marriage is " formalization of a mating pair " , and " reproduction is implied " , doesn't this cheapen the institution of marriage in your eyes ? Obviously , they are not getting married to start a family ... perhaps love is what is important ? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Mating pairs exist with or without marriage , and have no legal connection with marriage ( since , legally , it doesn't matter if the two people even like one another , or ever intend on consumating said marriage ) . The only connection between a mating couple and marriage is the connection made on a cultural level . So , logically , the cultural meaning of marriage would be the purpose of a mating couple . While ' purpose ' can mean different things , in this context I daresay most would refer to the evolutionary purpose of a mating couple : reproduction . Love is implied because love brings the couple together for that purpose . While legally a 27 yr old marrying a 70 yr old sugar daddy is not a problem , culturally speaking this marriage is not as meaningful as one that is in-line with the evolutionary purpose I outlined above . You can point to exceptions all you want , but all it does is outline the difference between the legal meaning and the cultural meaning of marriage .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Who gave you the power to decide what is culturally meaningful ?

In this specific case in point , the anti crowd wishes to limit the rights of others simply based on personally held beliefs ... when no harm is presented to any party involved . In a case such as this , I feel strongly that without a specific vector of harm , we must as a civilized society rule in favor of providing equal rights rather than limit rights of a minority .

I don't think you have a rational basis upon which to dispute that observation .

 S1 States that the current definition of marriage specifically excludes homosexuals because the current definition is "two people that are not underage, or opposite genders, same species, not closely related and not already married" and that gays want to be married under current definition. Believes that ability to reproduce is implied in definition. S2 Claims S1's definition isn't only possible, refers to lack of reproductive abilities of an elderly person and a younger person marrying. S1 Refers to differences between cultural definitions of marriage and mating pairs or legal definitions of marriage. S2 Ask who agve S1 right to define cultural meanings. S1 Claims that cultural meaning comes from observation and that legal definition can be decided any way. S2 Asks who gets to make that legal definition. Claims that those that oppose gay marriage are opposing something that harms no one and are trying to limit other's actions. S1 States that in America people vote on laws or those that make them and that is who gets to determine legality of different marriage concepts.

 S1 argues that marriage has a specific and deeply embedded definition within culture. Marriage is a formalized mating pair. Marriage's legal definition closely mirrors that definition. Homosexual marriage has never been an explicit or implicit part of those definitions. Including it would make the definition of marriage inherently self-contradictory. S2 argues that S1 is exercising a subjective definition. S2 notes that different members of society have different definitions of marriage. Further, there are instances of accepted marriage which violate S1's provided definitions. Instead, love, the emotional connection is what is most important.  S1 argues that legal and cultural definitions are not the same. The cultural definition is what is important. Most associate marriage with producing offspring, hence it is deemed important in the cultural definition. S2 questions S1's authority to determine what is culturally important and whether his cultural definition is appropriate for a legal definition. S1 says appropriateness is irrelevant. Cultural definitions have formed the root of all other definitions. The cultural definition of marriage has always been one male and female in monogamy.

 D2
 ----------
 S1 is focused on the definition of marriage and the cultural definition, both limiting marriage to heterosexual couples.  The cultural definition includes reproduction, he uses the term mating mating pairs.  He argues that this definition automatically excludes homosexuals because they cannot, without outside help, create a family.  He discusses other marriage outside of the norm-a young woman and older man- as being less meaningful than those that fulfill the cultural definition.  He sees it as the job of elected officials and the citizens to change the legal definition of marriage if that is what the majority want.
 S2 disagrees with and questions the cultural definition given by S1.  He feels that the main factor in marriage is not reproduction but love and commitment between two individuals.  He challenges the cultural definition with the example of a 65 and 68 year old getting married.  He finds it unfair that a group of people are being excluded from an institution on which they pose no threat to those who are enjoying the status quo.

 S1 argues that the cultural meaning of marriage is a formalization of a mating pair, who create and support a family unit. They believe that in order for homosexuals to be included, the definition and cultural meaning of marriage would have to change to accommodate it. They argue that the most dominant cultural view on marriage is based upon evolutionary sound logic, that a monogamous pair of individuals will reproduce. This person does not believe that the argument stands on equality because they do not believe that equality factors into the evolutionary view of marriage.
 S2 argues against the idea that there is a set, evolutionary definition of marriage and uses the example that people well over the age of reproduction are not only legally capable of getting married, but also suffer no special stigma for doing so. They believe what defines marriage is love between two people who desire a commitment between themselves. They argue that many do not share S1's definition of marriage and that it's an issue of personal belief rather than culture.

 S1 states that the legal definition of marriage is a contract between a man and a woman, who are not related, with no regard to love, or the intention of reproduction. S1 maintains, from the basis of observation, that the cultural definition of marriage is a formalization of a mating pair, love and the intension to reproduce being implied. Saying that homosexual couples are not a part of either definition, and that being included in the current definition is a catch-22, as homosexuality is not in sync with evolution. S1 further states that the only connection between, mating couples and marriage, are cultural.
     S2 defines marriage as a commitment between two people who love one another. Using a hypothetical marriage between a 65 year old woman and a 68 year old man as an example, argues that reproduction has no bearing on the definition of marriage, and that without a harm involved, equality of rights is what is important. S2 believes that personal opinions are subjective and should not be used as the basis to limit the rights of the minority.

 S1 References S2 that marriage is a public institution limited by law. This is subject to the will of the people expressed in a vote. It's ok to lobby on either side. S2 Calls for empathy and that people are denying gays what everyone else has. S1 Claims it is ok for people to believe as they wish on the issue and can lobby on it, but not to belittle those who oppose it due any reason. S2 Refers back to the empathy question and wishes S1 to imagine a reversed world where being heterosexual denied you marriage rights. S1 Claims it's not injustice because it's not denying something that you're allowed to do and refers to society's right to determine its own rules. S2 Refers to similarity between gay marriage and slavery, refers to empathy and claims cruelty to deny gay marriage.

 S1 and S2 are debating gay marriage. S1 argues that gay marriage should be decided by a public vote. S2 argues that it's cruel to limit someone else from enjoying rights you can currently enjoy. Opponents of gay marriage should try to have more empathy for gay people who wish to marry. S1 retorts that it is not cruel for society to bar someone from enjoying a particular right. Society can and does decide what it deems to be socially acceptable through consensus.  S2 states that tradition or being mundane does not make something any more wrong or right.  S2 compares S1's argument to a justification for slavery.  The majority once held slavery to be correct, hence it was morally and socially acceptable according to S1's logic. S1 says that he is not arguing for something being correct because it's traditional, only that it can be changed through convincing society to change.  It is up to society to determine what is permissible through a dialog between the proponents of gay marriage and society.

 S1 believes that the best way to legalize same sex marriage is through lobbying.  He thinks that in any discrepancy both sides should lobby and the one who has the majority support should win. Society is run by the majority opinion and he agrees that this is how it should be.  He agrees that same sex marriage should be legal but that the only way it can and should happen is when the majority believes it, even if roles were reversed and his relationship was not able to be acknowledged as a marriage.  When S2 compares marriage inequality to slavery he disagree that the comparison is valid but continues his argument for lobbying citing Wilberforce in his fight to abolish slavery.
 S2 attempts to appeal to S1's emotions by repeatedly asking that he put himself in the shoes of those who are being denied the right to marriage.  He questions S1's ability to feel empathy and compares the issue of marriage equality to slavery in regards to the majority allowing it to exist.

 S1 believes that marriage is a public institution that has its rules and requirements. They believe that it is in someone's rights to lobby to change those rules and requirements if they desire. However, they also believe that it is equally within someone's rights to lobby to keep the status quo on rules and requirements. They do not believe that it is cruel to decide that someone else should not have what another enjoys based on the idea that it is within one's rights to decide such things. This person argues that since marriage is seen as a public institution, society has the ultimate say in how it is treated. 
 S2 believes that it is cruel for the voice of the majority to continually lobby out the minority. This person does not believe that they have the right to tell people who they can and cannot marry. This person argues that just because something is the law does not make it any less cruel, and counters S1's arguments by comparing their views to that of slavery.

 S1 maintains that the current definition of marriage, being a public institution that has remained unchanged since cave man days, is neither cruel, nor unjust. S1 says that if the gay marriage laws of society are not to your liking than you should lobby for change, put the decision to a vote, and abide by the decision. S1 states that cruelty and injustice occur when you are stopped from doing something that you are not allowed to do, and further denies that the alleged suffering of gays is comparable to that of the slaves. 
     S2 believes that the ban on gay marriage is cruel and unjust, he likens the injustice of gay marriage to that of the slave trade. S2 believes that suffering and injustice should not be allowed, even if the institution that allows it has always been the law of the land. S2 states that it is not the suffering of one group to that of the other that was compared, but that S1's beliefs were being applied to the slave trade, particularly that it was the law at the time, where today it is illegal.

 S1 asserts that the characters Bert and Ernie from Sesame Street at not homosexual partners. He suggests that homosexuals cannot understand how two men can be close without engaging in homosexual acts. He compares using Bert and Ernie as homosexual icons to using Kermit and Miss Piggy as a symbol for interspecies relationships. He argues that it is unfair for homosexuals to claim that they aren't sexual deviants when they are projecting deviant sex onto children's programs. He claims that homosexuals engage in deviant sexual practices and that they are attempting to project these behaviors onto Bert and Ernie under the pretense of them being married. He also claims that once same-sex marriage is legalized, it is possible that straight men will marry each other in order to gain some unspecified advantages.
 S2 asserts that the argument currently being discussed is regarding marriage, not sexual behaviors of married couples. He claims that it is possible to represent two characters as homosexual without invoking sexual behaviors, comparing this to portraying heterosexual characters without being sexually explicit.

 S1 believes that Bert and Ernie are just two men who are really good friends and happen to live together. He feels that the homosexual deviants want to see Bert and Ernie as gay and is sickened by the hypocrisy of them saying that they don't feel that way. He feels that Kermit and Miss Piggy are not portrayed as being sexually active but that calling Bert and Ernie gay would automatically mean that they were. He also feels that if gay marriage were to be legalized then there would be some straight men who would find it to their advantage to get married to other men for the benefits.
    S2 refutes that he wants Bert and Ernie to be gay, and that he had never said anything like that, and that S1 should look at the false fallacy paradox that was mentioned earlier. He feels that S1 has a dirty mind for saying that that was what he had thought, pointing that it was S1 who brought up sexual topics in the first place. He refutes that he wanted anything to do with a sexual relationship on a kids program, just that there could be married couples on Sesame Street, straight or gay there wouldn't have to be any mention of sexual situations.

 S1 doesn't believe that Bert and Ernie are homosexual, and that homosexuals cannot understand that two men can be close friends without desiring sex with each other. This person believes that it wasn't the creators' intentions for it to be taken that way. They believe homosexuals want to interject what they believe to be deviant sexual practices into children's programming. They believe there is no distinction between homosexuality and sexual relations, and that one cannot be homosexual without practicing intercourse with one's own gender. They believe that when people discuss homosexual marriage that they are trying to disguise what they believe to be deviant sexual activity by using the word marriage.
 S2 argues against S1 by stating that heterosexual marriages can be portrayed without sexual relations being alluded to or mentioned. They believe that heterosexuals and homosexuals can discuss marriage without ever needing to get into the details of sexual activity or even touching the topic of sexual activity. They don't agree that when one discusses marriage that they are also trying to discuss sexual activity.

 S1 believes that S2 wants Bert and Ernie to be gay and that this will sexualize them to children because gay men engage in "deviant" sexual behavior.

S1 states that S2 wants Bert and Ernie to be described to children as engaging in deviant sexual behavior but under the guise of "married".
 S2 points out that the show is a work of fiction and that he merely said marriage and that S1 is who brought sex acts into the equation. He states that straight people are portrayed to children and it has nothing to do with their sex life. He merely thinks that having two male characters who are married will help support gay inclusion.

 S1 finds the argument that Bert and Ernie could be homosexuals extremely offensive arguing that characters created for children's programs should not be sexualized at all. This leads into the topic of gay marriage and gay sex which he labels as deviant.  He questions whether two straight men would marry simply for the benefits of marriage if same sex marriage was legalized.  He accuses S2 and other homosexuals of wanting Bert and Ernie to have a same sex marriage, which would include "playing with their genitals".
 S2 never comes out and says he believes Bert and Ernie are gay but argues for them to be allowed to be in a same sex relationship.  Throughout his arguments he differentiates between the relationship and sexual behaviors.  He mentions other relationships in children's programs like Kermit and Miss Piggy and the lack of sexualization when dealing with couples of the opposite sex.  He refutes S1's claims that men will marry with the idea that they already can marry women and would not have to get into a same sex relationship to get the benefits of marriage.
 
 <br><br><b>Key</b><br> 1-5672_6_5__7_13_15_16_17_20_2 <br><b>Dialog</b> <br><b>S1:1-  </b>Actually , I think it's probably the most compelling argument I've read for the amendment . The be fair , I don't think the author is claiming there is a direct link between gay marriage and crime . He seems to be talking about overall effect on society and traditional family . But I'm still against the amendment ; amending the constitution over something like this is just not the right thing to do .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>" compelling argument " ? So do you believe the basis of what he's claiming ? And are you ready to debate it ? Because there is no " overall effect on society and traditional family " from gay marriage . The " traditional family " has been having its OWN problems , and has been in decline in these countries LONG BEFORE gay marriage ever was legalized . It's like a guy jumping out of an airplane , and he starts falling to the ground . Three seconds later gay marriage is legalized , and conservatives want to blame the fact that he's falling on gay marriage ... It makes no sense . There is no causality here ... Do straight people say , " Hey ! Gay marriage is legal . I don't want to get married now . " Do straight people say , " Hey ! Gay marriage is legal . I want to get a divorce now . " The " most compelling argument " lacks any semblance of sense . <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes it does , because what is happening here is that ' family ' and ' marriage ' are being redefined . It is being broadened . People like Colson believe that marriage and family fits a certain criteria for it to truly be a marriage . That criteria IS traditional marriage , and if that changes that in Colson's eyes traditional marriage IS affected . I don't see how you can say that adopting gay marriage has no effect on that . I've heard Colson speak , BTW ; he speaks all over the country . I agree with some of what he's said and some I don't . He would say the same thing about kids raised in single parent homes ; but it's not that he's saying single parent homes are bad ; he's saying that homes with a mother and father are the best scenario . I think that's what he's saying here too . He's basically saying that by his observations of prisons , that traditional families do best in terms of raising children and them staying out of prison . Whether he's right or not is another matter , but I think it's important to at least represent the man's statements correctly here .<br><b> S2:2-  </b>LOL ! I don't see how you can say that it DOES have an effect on that . Tell me , for starters , WHAT effect it will happen . Will Colson get a divorce if gay marriage is legalized ? Will Colson wish he had never gotten married if gay marriage is legalized ? THEY are claiming SPECIFIC effects . NEGATIVE effects . Effects that should be PROVEN for them to be claimed ... HOW can they claim those SPECIFIC DETRIMENTAL effects from gay marriage onto OTHER PEOPLE's marriages ??? Where's the proof ? 1 ) Studies DO back-up the issue of " single vs dual parent house-holds " . And that is common sense . Two heads are better than one . Twice the capability to care . 2 ) Studies REFUTE the claims that dual heterosexual parents are better than dual gay parents . They aren't . Gay parents are just as good . The gender of the parents are irrelevant . The sexual orientation of the parents is irrelevant . Where did I misrepresent something Jyoshu ? He's claiming a SPECIFIC DETRIMENTAL EFFECT on families due to gay marriage . THAT is what I'm talking about . THAT is what I want proven , if he's going to claim it . <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Easy . . . marriage in the defined sense will be changed . It will be more broadened . Where did he claim that ? All I see is that he feels that traditional families are better in terms of kids from them staying out of prison . It seemed to me you were representing this as someone ' blaming ' gay marriage for crime . If that's not what you meant , then fair enough .<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Is that ALL the effect you are claiming then ? Are you then contradicting the previous article's claim that it will have a negative effect on heterosexual marriages ? Did you read the article Jyoshu ? Do you even know what we're talking about ? Again , did you READ the article Jyoshu ? Because if not , then why did you claim : " Actually , I think it's probably the most compelling argument I've read for the amendment . " For Jyoshu's edification : If you don't comprehend that is PRECISELY what the author IS doing , then I don't know what to tell you . It's there in black and white ! <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I never said I was compelled , or convinced by the article . I said it was probably the most compelling that I've seen . I see nothing in that quote blaming gay marriage for crime , directy OR even indirectly . You are making an inference --o ne that may or may NOT be intended . I would think if Colson's point was to lay blame for crime he would have simply said so . He didn't . Colson is simply opposing thge amendment because he believes that traditional families are best in terms of avoiding crime . I don't really agree either -- I think there are too many variables for that to automatically be the case .<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Oh . I see . So if somebody said " Christianity causes cancer " , that would be a compelling argument for people to not be Christians . Right ? Give me a freakin ' break Jyoshu . READ the article . It's talking about gay marriage and the effects of it on society . It makes claims that : 1 ) Gay marriage will cause detriment to straight marriages . 2 ) Detriment to straight marriages , e.g. single parent families , yield greater instances of criminals . It's all right there . In plain English . I am making no " inference " . This IS what the author is saying . Then explain to me his next paragraph where he links LEGALIZATION of gay marriage to a decrease in " traditional families " . Can't you put two and two together ? And Colson is not " opposing " the amendment . He's SUPPORTING it . From the article : " This is just one reason that I am so passionately in favor of the Marriage Protection Amendment ... " Can't you even get THAT right ? Or are you so lost in obfuscation that you've confused yourself ? <br><br><b>Summaries</b><br>

 S1 claims that despite arguments linking same-sex marriage to negative effects on society and traditional families, he is against the constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriages on the grounds that it is an inappropriate topic for a constitutional amendment. He references a person named Colson who believes that the terms "marriage" and "family" need to meet specific criteria, and that legalizing same-sex marriage would change those criteria, leading to changes in the meaning of traditional marriage. He also claims that Colson believes that traditional families have the best outcomes in regards to criminal behavior of offspring. 
 
 S2 rejects the claim that same-sex marriage has a negative effect on society, suggesting that traditional marriage was on the decline long before same-sex marriage was ever legalized. He also questions what negative effect same-sex marriage could have on society, claiming that there are no studies suggesting that two heterosexual parents fare any better than two homosexual parents because there is no difference in reality, and that there is no reason to predict that same-sex marriages would affect crime.

 S1 feels that Colson's is the most compelling argument for the Marriage Protection Amendment yet, but that he still does not support it personally, as the changing the constitution of it isn't right. He feels that the legalization of gay marriage would redefine what family is in a negative manner. He feels that the broadening of what constitutes the definition of marriage would somehow weaken traditional marriage. This, he says, would lead to more crime.
   S2 feels that the problems with traditional marriage in this country began long before gay marriage began to be legalized. He makes an analogy of a man jumping out of a plane before gay marriage, and gay marriage being blamed. He does not feel that gay marriage has any effect on traditional marriage at all, and that society is not harmed by the inclusion of gay marriage. He believes that any statement that says that gay marriage harms society should be proven before being widely talked about. He feels that S1 is misrepresenting himself and twisting his argument to make statements that are different from what Colson had written.

 S1 doesn't agree that amending the Constitution is the right things to do, though they find the argument connecting society and traditional family compelling regardless. They believe that the definition of the words family and marriage are being broadened and redefined. They argue that those who oppose this change believe that marriage and family fit a certain criteria to truly be a marriage, and that criteria is traditional marriage. They agree on some points with these people, and believe that adopting homosexual marriage will have an effect on that definition, but they don't on others.
 S2 doesn't believe that there will be an effect on traditional marriage because of the adoption of homosexual marriages. They believe that the traditional family has its own problems and has been in decline long before the issue was brought up. They don't agree that connecting society and traditional family to homosexual marriage is logical or compelling and that there is reasonable evidence for the contrary. They don't believe there is substantial proof to argue that homosexual marriage will affect society.

 S1 states that the author is not drawing a link between gay marriage and crime but to the overall effect on family and community. S1 is against the proposed amendment and does not believe that the constitution should be changed for this but feels the author has a compelling argument.That Colson is not saying gay marriage is responsible for increased crime.   S1 is saying that Colson is right when he says that broadening the defintion of marriage will impact "traditonal" marriage.
 
 S2 feels this argument has no merit. That traditional marriage is not effected just because gay marriage is legal. One has no impact on the other. Straight marriage has been in decline for years long before gay marriage was legalized.  For Colson to state that traditional marriage will deteriorate is preposterous. S2 states that a household with two parents will obviously do better in raising their children because there is twice the capability to care for the child, but the sex of those two parents is irrelevant. S2 also states that Colson is saying that gay marriage yields more criminals because Colson links gay marriage to a decrease in traditional families, and decreases in traditional marriages result in more criminals.

 S1 considers Colson's article on gay marriage to be compelling.  He reads it as a comment on society generally, defends the author's views on traditional families and does not see it as a direct attack on same sex marriage. He refers to the statistics on children of traditional families being at a lower risk of ending up in prison.  He later mentions that he does not necessarily agree with this conclusion that was drawn by Colson.
 S2 argues against any protection of the traditional family pointing out that it has been having its own issues.  He sees Colson's article as a direct attack on any family other than what has been labeled traditional- two heterosexual parents raising children.  He believes that the article is inferring that homosexual parents would end up raising children who commit crimes.  He also argues with the concept that homosexual marriages will have a direct negative impact on heterosexual marriages mentioning that any claims need to be backed up to be reliable that there is nothing to back up any claims on this issue.

 S1 claims that legalizing same-sex marriage requires redefining family and marriage and that it would affect traditional marriage. He references a person named Colson who believes that same-sex households are deficient compared to heterosexual households in the same way that a single-parent household is deficient compared to a two-parent household. There is nothing inherently wrong with the deficient family systems, but they are not ideal. S1 notes that he does sometimes agree with gay rights supporters, for example, believing that the constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage is a bad idea, that homosexuals do experience violence and harassment, and that homosexuals should not be discriminated against when it comes to adoption, housing, or employment. 
 
 S2 rejects the comparison of same-sex households to single-parent households by noting that there is not a constitutional amendment to ban single-parenthood. He claims that S1's inconsistent arguments in favor of and against same-sex marriage make it doubtful whether he actually does support gay rights, and he suggests that it is possible that S1 is being paid to post on the forum.

 S1 feels that marriage and family are being redefined, and that including gay marriage into the definition of traditional marriage affects traditional marriage in a negative manner. He expresses that he supports some of what Colson says and doesn't support some of the other stuff he says. He admits to accidentally miss-wording something, and refutes any "game" being involved. He feels that S2 is being hostile, and that S2's main reason for being there is to disagree with people and not to debate the topic at hand.
   S2 feels that Colson has done very well for being a felon, but that he should stop drawing conclusions about gay parenthood based on observations of single parenthood. He thinks S1 does not actually support gay rights, but is purposely misrepresenting himself, and points to times that he said one thing and then voiced opposition to that same thing. He questions wether S1 might be getting paid to be there, and feels this is the least bad reason that S1 could have for the discrepancies in his views.

 S1 believes that what is happening is a redefining of the meanings behind family and marriage. Specifically, they believe that the definitions for both are being broadened. This person argues that to certain people, that is what matters and is why people oppose homosexual marriage. They point out that those who speak out against it believe that traditional families perform the best in terms of raising children and keeping them from becoming criminals. He or she argues that these people do not believe that single parent homes are bad, necessarily, but that a home with both a mother and a father are best. However, he or she personally agrees with the homosexual movement's opinions on the matter of homosexual marriage and that there should be efforts to stop discrimination and harassment.
 S2 believes that people with opinions opposing homosexual marriage are getting their opinions from negative observations of single parenthood. They do not believe that S1 has been consistent in their arguments and that S1's opinions lean towards standing against homosexual rights rather than supporting them.

 S1 is pointing out that by changing the definition of marriage in a proposed amendment it will affect traditional marriages. S1 quotes Colson and is attempting to make sure that Colson is not misrepresented. That Colson's belief is that the "traditional" household is the best scenario and does the best job in regards to keeping their children out of prison. He asserts that Colson feels the same regarding single parent households as well. That they are not "bad" but traditional households have the most success. S1 agrees with some of Colson's points but also agrees with many gay rights issues regarding discrimination, harassment, and adoption. S1 also points out that S2 seems to attack posters personally rather than the topics at hand. 
 S2 feels that S1 continually draws conclusions about gay marriage from single parent household statistics. S2 also feels that S1 may be compensated financially for participation in the forum due to the discrepancy of S1 opposing the amendment and his stated beliefs but constantly bringing up arguments which are in opposition to those beliefs.

 S1 begins by defending Colson, who does not appear directly in the conversation but primarily deals with issues of single parenthood in favor of traditional families.  This then carries into the debate on same sex marriage arguing the family structure is not as secure, even looking at whether or not children of non traditional families end up in prison at higher rates.  S1's argument gets confused when he later states that he is in favor of sex sex adoption, quite contrary to the beliefs of Colson whom he was initially defending.  He also speaks in favor of protects for homosexual relationships and individuals and against the amendment that would prevent gay marriage.
 S2 takes issue with what Colson argues pointing out that single parenthood has not been attacked politically through attempts at amendments.   He mostly questions S1's validity, accusing him of being paid to post.  There is not much opinion being given from S2 but rather objections to much of what S1 has said both in the current text as well as mentions of previous debates.
