Obviously basic biology and reproductive facts are not your strong point.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Nor are they <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I am not a scientist. I am a philosopher. That said, I do study the concepts of science and whatever facts I need to understand the issue. Which is less I can say for you.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You made a statement that was wrong and accused another of ignorance when the ignorance was yours. You are no more a philosopher than anyone else who makes incorrect statements and then tries to hide it by accusing others of A philosopher?.. Diogenes without wit, intelligence and <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I made no wrong statement. You just dont know anything about biology. The ignorance is yours.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So it is not wrong because you say its.. how pathetic.. defend the statement or concede you were wrong.. superman</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-6013_30_29__31_33_34_36_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No, you have it all wrong, but it doesn't surprise me because I used to think that way. Consider this analogy. Fire is useful and in many ways beneficial. But misused, it can ( and usually is ) deadly. Same with the sexual relationship. Kept within the confines of marriage, it brings an incredible source of pleasure, fulfillment, and blessing. But when it is misused in ways as you suggest, then there is nothing but pain and emptiness. You don't always have to have sex in a romantic relationship.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>But why not have sex in a romantic relationship? It's an incredible source of pleasure, contraception, and if necessary plan-b, removes the possibility of pregnancy and selective choice virtually eliminates the possibility of social disease transmition. Bassman, you wouldn't be attempting to force your evangelical belief system into the thread by telling consenting adults sex without marriage is all wrong, would you? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Because it is not an essential part of said relationship. As I've stated What?? Oh, you mean conception And encourages more promiscuity. Plan B is not an end-all-be-all. With a 90% effectiveness, this is still unacceptable. The only 100% effective means is abstinence before marriage. First off, as an Evangelical, I'm offended by that remark. Second, up until the " sexual revolution " of the ' 60 s and 70's even most unbelievers exercised more common sense when it came to the sexual relationship.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I don't know why you'd be offended. Does your belief system not condemn sex without marriage under any circumstance? The so-called sexual revolution you refer to was over 40 - years ago. It assisted in removing a social stigma of sex without marriage, something that existed long before Christianity. If you're going to base your opinions on the dogma of your belief system, why not exclude terms like common sense and relationships without marriage? They have no real meaning when your bottom line opinion is no marriage, no sex. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>One, just because I base my life on the Bible doesn't mean I throw common sense out the window. In fact, scripture is replete with sound advice concerning life issues, including sex. Two, what " greatness " has resulted in the " sexual revolution "?? Nothing but devestation. STDs, illegitimacy, broken lives, abortion. That is the legacy of the " sexual revolution ".<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Common sense is defined as good judgment not based on specialized knowledge, which would certainly exclude following antiquated personal oracles such as belief system dogma. While your bible may provide you and your sect with a sense of personal security based on faith, it has little meaning once you step into the real world. I'm not condemning your beliefs, merely pointing out that they're not applicable to everyone. I would find it rather difficult to even imagine blaming US societal problems in general on sex outside of marriage.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3791_319_307__322_336_350_353_4<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Well, did making incest illegal result in women's lifes being put in jeopardy? Because making abortion illegal sure will!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>A woman's life is also put in jeopardy when they have a Legal abortion. Just LESS jeopardy. On the original question of when does a human become a person? I don't know if anyone answered this one yet. But it's simply when a cell gains the natural ability to form into a NEW organism. That's pretty much it. Totipotency. Sperm doesn't have that ability, neither do ova, nor do skin cells, or liver cells, or anything else in our body. They are all specific cells designed to do a function. Only one cell in a human ever has the ability to become another human " person ". And that is a fertilized egg. S o.. that's when you became a person. The moment you became. Using the logic of " a person isn't a person until they are fully formed " is ridiculous. By that logic, we could kill every child who hasn't hit puberty. Because they aren't fully formed yet. Any questions? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Abortion is a medical procedure. All medical procedures carry risk, that is why it is so important that they be carried out by medically trained professionals rather than quacks and butchers. So if you follow your logic all medical procedures should be outlawed because a person's life will be put in jeopardy. If you needed a medical procedure, how would you feel if the only option you have is to go to quacks and butchers?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>First of all, I never stated that any medical procedures should be outlawed. You jumped to conclusions. Secondly, Why are you throwing around the word NEED like that? In the very few cases ( 2.8% ) where the mother's life may be in jeopardy from the pregnancy, she will NEED an operation. All other elective abortions are a WANT. So a woman would NEVER have to go to a quack or butcher for an operation that she NEEDED, if it was illegal for all other elective abortions. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>When women are in a desperate situation, it becomes a need. Not everybody is fortunate enough to have family and friends for support.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Nope. Nothing doing. When talking life and death of a fetus, the need to perform the abortion should be a reason of life or death of the mother all other " needs " pale in comparison and, in my book, are just " wants ". And you are wrong about women not haveing family or friends for support. Every woman in the world can find a family and friend who will help with adoption.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3791_517_514__519_520_521_522_523_524_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No! At conception we are a person and human. All living things belong to a species and the foetus is a living thing, for that reason a foetus must belong to a species, and that species is human. A fingernail is dead so cannot be considered a living human, nor will it develop into a human. The sperm only has half the chromosomes so is not human. The unique human is the key element here, if you cut your nail, the DNA from the nail can be replicated by the living persons nail, a foetus when destroyed cannot have itself replicated, the unique DNA that is destroyed will never be see on earth again, that individual has gone forever, howver, the man with the nail clipped is still alive.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>How do you know we are a person at conception? What is the source of your conviction? What guides your reason and can anyone come to your viewpoint without faith in some divine authority? My common sense suggests that a mass of human tissue that has yet to develop sentience cannot be fairly defined as a " person ". <br><b>S1:2-  </b>A fully grown human is just a mass of tissue, and cells.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So you reject the existence of the soul? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No, but if you are going to claim that conception is just a mass of cells then, you must agree that an adult human is a mass of cells too. You have no proof when the soul enters the body or that there is one at all ; the safest thing to assume is that the soul enters the body at conception. Also define what it is to be a    person   , and don    t use your opinion.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You said an adult was " just " a mass of cells. I beg to differ. I'm not interested in playing it safe. Akin to Pascal's wager which is for cowards. If I must use the thoughts of others to define person then why don't you look it up for yourself. Is my opinion invalid when another's given them by dogma is to be unchallenged? Btw you never answered my question as to how you know that a person exists at conception. Please don't be evasive as this is critical. You defer to an unseen authority and mean to impose your beliefs on all. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>And you said : " My common sense suggests that a mass of human tissue that has yet to develop sentience cannot be fairly defined as a " person ". " I beg to differ. Please don't be evasive as this is critical. You defer to an unseen authority and mean to impose your beliefs on all. I thought your arguments would crumble at the point of defining a " person ".<br><b> S2:4-  </b>It's not about crumbling Jimmy. The subject is not as clear cut as you'd like, that's all. You stipulated that I not express my opinion. Here you go then. http://encyclopedia.laborlawtalk.com...ans_persons.3F I defer to no one and I am not hoping to force my beliefs upon others. No one is forced to get an abortion. Will you be answering as to the source of your " knowledge "? Mine is limited to biology.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3791_291_290_1_295_298_315_321_339_348_10<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Ah..! So it nudity were legal you would do it. Well, if you come down under to Bondi beach you can half do it, and it is legal    Wait! Don    t rush we are in winter   <br><b> S2:1-  </b>Sorry to disappoint you but nobody over here has to go all the way over to kangaroo country to go topless... we have places only a few hours away from Toronto for that, but like I said people here just don't do it, it just isn't done! Its a cultural thing. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Big deal! I go topless all the time in my back yard.... and front yard. Australia is sohhhh enlightened. It must be the weather....<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Enlightened or uncivilized? More likely the riff raff heritage of convicts is still pretty strong in Aussie land. We are just more civilized over here, only tourists go to " those kind of beaches " as the locals here say. The locals avoid " those kind of beaches " like the plague and have kept it as far away from Toronto as possible by law.... so sorry! In fact so far there has only been one case of a woman going topless in Toronto proper and it caused a major accident... there was a 10 car pile up on the roads! This is a true story. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>10 car pile up for topless!!! Hmmm   . how many cars for bottomless? :)<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Don't get so snooty about it. It could have happened in kangaroo country too, some crazy woman decided to walk topless in the street downtown Toronto ( not on the beach ). Because of political correctness, the press could not say what nationality she was, but everybody was convinced it was some french tourist... those french always causing mayhem where ever they go! <br><b>S1:4-  </b>If she was French then she was probably good looking, and definitely not fat, as fat french women do not exist.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>When was the last time you went to France?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-5289_51_50__56_59_60_61_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Steeeeve : Does the grocer need the bread because he or she is starving? Or, does the grocer need the bread to make more money? Is it more moral to make more money than it is to let someone starve? Is it selfish to want something because one is starving? Is that selfishness? Or, desperation? Is profit more important to you than moral justice? Do you understand what moral justice is? Do you worship money? Do you worship the rich?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Did you ever think that selling that bread will allow the grocer to feed his family? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The grocer has only that one loaf of bread? You know, Steeeeve, your saying that makes me think that you have not evolved beyond the basic animalistic instinct of the primitive human to grab everything and hang onto it for dear life, as opposed to a more highly evolved state of humanity where one gives, rather than takes, shares, rather than hoards, forgives and has mercy as opposed to rigidly enforcing archaic laws.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Maybe the grocer needed to sell that loaf of bread to pay rent to keep his business open to support his family? Not that this matters because stealing is still wrong and I wouldn't support it even if it was to save him from starving. You go on this long speech about how primitive humans grab onto everything and hang onto it... you mean like the man stealing the bread? Or gives rather than takes.... you mean like the man stealing the bread ( taking )? Mercy as in killing a human based on size of development? You are all over the place on the issues Simone <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You don't seem to understand, Steeeeve. Starvation can mean death. If someone allows someone to starve to death might that not be murder? Just on the supposition that you can follow that argument, I'm not holding my breath here, is not murder a greater criminal act than stealing? Is the ownership of inanimate property more important than human life? Do property values have precedent over human life?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>no on what level? There is no level of " wrong "... if you are wrong you are wrong. To you they do. To me, not so much. IF someone is starving, I am obligated to help them... if they steal from me, I am obligated to punish them. This isn't a hard concept.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3483_22_21__23_25_26_27_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>So what does make something right? A little off topic, I know, but I'm curious about how you assign moral values to things.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I can only sspeak for myself but I received most of my moral values and beliefs from my parents and my 14 years of Catholic education...... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I think you misunderstand me. I'm asking you to explain what your reasons are for deciding what moral values things have. What method do you use for determining if something is right?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>My experience.......... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Okay, and how do you understand those experiences in terms of moral value?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I believe I am a man of high principles and moral values, now if you don't have any other questions of me can we get back on topic........ I believe I have answered your question........... Thanks........</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-9621_10_9__12_13_14_17_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Thanks for agreeing that there is a qualitative difference between a person and a fetus.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Abortion is the killing of an innocent human being. And the people who do that will have to answer to God in due time. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Just which god might that be? Yahweh? Krishna? he Great Spirit? Allah? Please specify.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The Great God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The Lord Jesus Christ. The older dog. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And just exactly WHY should one particular religious faith determine the civil law? We are a multireligious nation, and there are others who are of NO religious faith. Why should their values and behavior be dictated by something they do not accept as Gospel ( Meaning intended! ) P<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You mean an unborn baby is not a human being? What were you? As far as religion goes, this country wasn't founded on Buddhism or atheism, nor are the majority of Americans today anything other than Christians. We have just as much right to lobby for what we believe is right as do the imbeciles at the Wall Street demonstrations. Don't kill the innocent unborn for the sins or convenience of the parents.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-9621_15_9__16_20_26_27_28_31_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Thanks for agreeing that there is a qualitative difference between a person and a fetus.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>When does a fetus become a ' person '? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The answer to that question depends very much upon which system of belief, ethics, and morals one subscribes to. For most Jews, it is at crowning during the process of birth. For the RC sect of Christians, it is at conception. Other Christian sects place it at different points along that continuum. This leads inexorably to the conclusion that there is NO one " right " answer. as a result, the proper course for the law is to remain silent and to leave the choice where it properly belongs - with each pregnant woman.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I wasnt referring to religious belief, I was asking when a fetus becomes a person. You assert that a sentient fetus that can feel pain and stress should be painfully destroyed if the pregnant mother decides that what she wants? I am not anti abortion but I am against aborting a fetus that would suffer during a termination. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I assert that, as a man. I am not entitled to answer the question. What I do find interesting is that when people talk about universals, those universals universally correspond to THEIR values.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You assert that you should have no influence or opinion on the suffering of a sentient human that is defined as a fetus you mean. Maybe you dont feel man enough. How does your interesting find on universals have any relevance regarding my post? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>1. Exactly so, since the choice of whether or not to accept the hypothesis that a fetus is sentient is very much a mater of discussion among those with the knowledge that gives their opinions weight.. 2. I believe in the strength of each woman's intellect that she is capable of choosing what is in her best interest, and her best interest is controlling. 3. YOU claim that the prohibition gains abortion is or should be a universal, and that corresponds to YOUR values when others disagree who are just as moral and ethical as you. Ideologues more often than not believe that their word is law in the universe.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>So if it was deemed by ' those with the knowledge that give their opinion weight ' that a fetus can feel pain and stress during a termination you would agree that the termination should not be carried out.. well done Then you are contradicting your last statement I claim nothing more than a termination should not be done if there is enough evidence that the fetus is sentient enough to suffer during the process. If the fetus is developed enough to suffer ( and therefore sentient ) it should be considered an individual and it should be very carefully considered before performing an abortion. You are the one claiming universal idealogies can you not read what you write? You are claiming that in every pregnancy from conception to term the pregnant woman should have the right to terminate the pregnancy for whatever reason she sees fit.. if you do not understand that to be a universal idealogy to fit YOUR values then you really do not understand your own</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3730_20_17__21_22_33_34_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>That's just your opinion however. To me, the early stages of a fetus aren't really " human ". - Wez<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And that is just your opinion........ Have you ever asked yourself, What if I am wrong? Probably not......... So I guess you are against abortion in the 3rd trimester then becasue babies at that can and have survived outside the womb........ <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Hence the fact I stated it as my opinion. She did not. Unless the mother's life is endangered, I'd most likely be against them. - Wez<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Who did not? So if the mothers life is not endangered in the 3rd trimester and the baby is viable outside the womb you would be against and abortion? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Swimming FISHX Barring serious physical deformities / mental damage, or in some exceptional circumstances, then yes I would be against such an abortion. Yes, that's what I meant. :) - Wez<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well at lest I thank you for that.......... As far as I am concerned it would have to depend on how serious the deformity or other damage is......... There have been great gains in medical science in a lot of those areas and i think the baby at least deserves a chance to live...........</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8863_47_18__48_49_50_51_52_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Do you? I believe that homosexuality is just as gentically influenced as is a person's heterosexuality. I also believe that there is a lot of people somewhere in the middle and that their sexuality also is for the most part " genetic. " So, ( in my opinion ) saying that homosexuality should be illegal is a lot like saying that people who are left handed or born with red hair should be criminalized. It would be idiotic to do that. Anthony 321 Yes it would. Chuz Life Not because making babies is a requirment for marriage,... but because making babies and rearing them to be productive citizens is most suited to the nations " general welfare " using the one man one woman relationship. Gay's can " marry " all they want,... call it whatever they want,... I personally don't care. But I'll still defend the governments right to define marriage as IT sees fit to meet the " general welfare " needs of the nation,... even if that means treating all the other variations to marriage with indifference.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Anthony 321 Does your selected group of those worthy of marriage include left handed people? How about red headed people? I am quite sure it does. A few paragraphs ago homosexuals were part of the left handed red headed members of society. Suddenly where marriage is concerned homosexuals are left at the back of the bus. What is about them that makes you feel that they should not be able to be married? What is about red headed and / or left handed people that makes you feel they should be able to marry? Anything that makes it okay to treat law abiding, tax paying, hard working citizens of a free nation, with indifference is not okay! Two consenting adults is not a variation on marriage. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I said several posts ago that Gays could still " marry " even in the absense of Governmental Recognition. You must have skipped that part.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Anthony 321 This issue is dealing with governmental recognition. And you are well aware of that. Would you be so kind as to reply to my former post, now that you know that I know that gay people are already allowed to have make believe marriages. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Must I? Then why ( other than to ridicule and flame ) do you ask? You just acknowledged that I do believe they can " marry " even in the absense of government recognition. So, I don't know where you are getting the idea that I " feel that they should not be able to marry. " It's my reading of the the Constitution that leads me to accept that the Government has the authority and the discretion to define marriage as it sees fit in making laws which " promote the general welfare. " ( Article 8, section 1 ) Nothing more. Two brothers? Two sisters? The State has the right and the responsibility to define marriage as it sees fit to promote the general welfare. The State has the right to exercise discretion in that vein. Indifference is not discrimination.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Anthony 321 You still have not answered what it is about homosexuals that makes them not worthy of legal marriage? The kind of legal marriage that red haired, left handed people are allowed to have. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>That's because I have no opinion on the " worthiness " of homosexual relationships.

While most of the country disagrees with late-term abortion, most of the country also supports early abortion.

There is plenty of evidence to base the conclusion upon that a human being's ( a person's ) life biologically begins at the moment of their conception. Then there is the fact that the Constitution protects all persons equally, mindless, handicapped, inconvienient to others,... etc. The Constitution recognizes persons as they are biologically human individual beings. All the metaphysical #### about " souls " or intelligence etc. is a bunch of hooey. Because the ONLY requirment for personhood is that a " person " be a " human being. " It's funny how some who claim to be for the seperation of church and state demand that " personhood " be based upon the " metaphysical " rather than the biological. Biologically, the logic goes like this ; 1 : A human fetus is an individual human being. 2 : Individual Human Beings are Persons. 3 : A human fetus is a " person.

Have it if you want but I doubt you will find statistics to show that birth control fails most of the time or that it is even used by most women seeking abortions. No, you're trying to say I implied it is only her responsibility, and I did not. I simply pointed out that non-rape victims willingly engaged in activity that could result in preganancy when birth control is an available choice. IMO, the woman she either use birth control or make sure the man is using it, the same is true for him. When the two of them decide to romp in the hay for the fun of it with no concern from either for birth control then abortion is simply a convenience for their irresponsible behaviour. At the time of choosing an abortion the choice is entirely hers and if she's getting one because she didn't want to get pregnant then she should have considered that before participating in the first place. Abortion should not be just another convenient form of birth control.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Because you've decided it's morally wrong? What you've chosen to call convenience is much more than that. Decisions affecting the rest of her life as well as those of any children she might ultimately have. To trivialize these indicates you have already placed the fetus equal to her. This is a moral judgement. She would have to share your morality to agree with you. She has no such obligation. Btw " before she spreads her legs " speaks volumes about your respect for women. How about " before he whips it out " instead. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not equal to but certainly more deserving of a chance at life than a common strep infection.....<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Again a moral judgement not shared by all.

Your point? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>you are arguing that the reasons women give for having abortions are invalid because it is self-reporting. the only way a woman can give a reason why she is having an abortion is by self reporting. therefore the fact still remains that the physical and anatomical damage caused by pregnancy was never reported by women as a reason for abortion, so it is clearly not why women have abortions. people that use these reasons to justify why abortion choice should be upheld are not in touch with the real reasons women have abortions. and while the physical damage reasons are valid, they are apparently not what women consider when making their choice<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, I am arguing that statistics are not accurate because it is self-reporting. And if self-reporting is as inaccurate as several reports bemoan, how is it " clearly not why "? Nope, not true. Whatever her reasons are abortion is justified. Again, even the studies you cited had many states where the majority of the reasons are not known. The studies you cited stated that self-reporting is inaccurate. The studies you cited stated that there are multiple reasons for a woman's decisions, never just one. The studies you cited had voluntary involvement. This is hardly a firm backing. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>the statistics accurately report the reasons women give as to why they chose to have abortions. the only way women can give their reasons for having an abortion is through self reporting. the choice to have an abortion is a personal issue for the woman in question. the reasons given stem from that personal aspect. how is it innacurate? it serves the intended purpose<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Ok, you got me ;) it is accurate reporting of inaccurate information. Yes, the only way to get the reasons is through self-reporting, and it has been shown to be inaccurate. This has been shown in studies regarding breast cancer, where abortions can be verified via records but self-reporting skewed the results.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-2554_6_5__7_9_11_12_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What you did was use unfoundedgeneralizations, which is exactly the sort of thing this thread is about.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And the assertion that pregnancy is a " wonderful miracle " would be what? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I said " bringing a life into the world " was a wonderful miracle. It is -- a baby is always wonderful, even if a woman doesn't want it.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Part of the process of " bringing a life into the world " is known as pregnancy. So you mean the " baby " is wonderful but not necessarily the " bringing ". Was I supposed to be able to infer that? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You can't draw a distinction between the two. ( Well, you can, but it would be a disingenous distinction. ) The pregnancy leads to the baby -- end the pregnancy and you have no baby, period.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>A " wonderful miracle " as you maintain is a generalization as it pertains to being pregnant since according to you it cannot be separated from the " baby ".</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-5030_21_20__25_26_27_28_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What have you done about this apparent genocide on your doorstep steeeve? - Wez<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Are you really curious or are you trying to set up an extreme argument where if I am not spending 100% of my time getting rid of abortion then I must not really be against it? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Well, I'm curious if so many people are pro-life and truly believe tens of millions of people are murdered, why so much effort is put into combating terrorism, drugs etc. instead of making abortion illegal. - Wez<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You mean in a federal dollar sense? Well, the Supreme Court kind of put a set back on the whole anti-abortion thing.... that is what the pro-lifers are working on now... which is oddly enough a joint battle to get the Supreme Court back to where it should be. Does this question your question or was it something different? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It does, but it seems like a fairly weak effort if people really think hundreds of Americans are murdered every day. If 100 s of Americans were picked at random and shot I reckon there'd be a greater outcry. What I'm getting is that I'm doubtful whether most pro-lifers really consider the life of a foetus as important as that of a grown up, or whether they are against abortion for other reasons. - Wez<br><b> S2:3-  </b>There wouldn't be an outcry if half the country was ok with it. Believe me when I say that pro-lifers ( most ) believe strongly that the unbron is just as important as anyone else. I also believe many people aren't informed about abortion. If you showed one of those people a picture of a 6 week old unborn and said " would you support aborting this? " I wonder what they might say. I think there might be more of a rationlization to say the unborn is not as important as grown up then to say it is as important.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-9306_7_6__8_9_10_11_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Can't a doctor be sued for this? Leave it to the Rethuglicans : " cutting the lawsuits " " keeping the government out of our medical records " What a bunch of sorry jack***** that waste the taxpayers ' time and money. We need to post the medical information for Oklahoma's legislators on line. Starting with their viagra medications, vasectomies, history of sexually transmitted diseases, prostate issues, number of women they've impregnated, number of times they've impregnated a woman.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You're fine with forcing others to pay for your healthcare but you don't want anybody to be able to gather anonymous info in order to better address the number of abortions performed. I guess as long as somebody else is paying, it's all good to you. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>My healthcare? Show me where I've said anything about my healthcare. The information isn't anonymous because women can be identified, especially in a small town. Besides, the women have a right to privacy and the doctors are obliged under law to respect doctor / patient confidentiality. So you can't even clear hurdle one, by a LONG shot. As usual, you waste our time and money, and burden society with your spiteful ways. So your view is ridiculous by logic and law. Here, too, and absurd -- since you're the one who wants the taxpayers to foot the bill for this bull. While you also clog up our court system with unnecessary cases. We could easily do without any of you in America. Why don't you move to a country like Afghanistan? Where the laws are more sympatico with that imaginary place you go to, when you roll your eyes up into your head...<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You're in favor of government-run heaithcare, right? And who funds the government? Right, OP ( other people ). :p Show me where a woman's anonymity is compromised, specifically. And if we're talking a small town, won't people see her going into the clinic? Did your mother have any kids that lived? Actually, if I'm the one paying for it, then I should be allowed to find a way to make it cost me less. There's no such thing as a free abortion. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So you mean you cannot show me where I've said anything about my healthcare. So we've finished with that one. So I guess I have a right to see YOUR medical records then? Because people can see you walking into your doctor's office. Those studies have already been done. There's been no mystery for some time as to what reduces the number of abortions. ( Besides the fact that you're not paying for anyone's abortion since they're not federally funded at present. ) Nor do you need to post data on the internet in order to conduct a study. You're just spiteful.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>That's it! I'm spiteful. Of course, your saying that abortions aren't federally funded now is a lie, but that's OK, since you've already been exposed.... so to speak.... I'll continue to humor you, dude. ;)</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-6122_9_5__10_11_15_18_22_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Im gonna have to go with Love Never Dies here. Ive read that story, and many, many people have been killed and suffered with Bush's policy in africa. Just because you never heard of it, doesnt mean it hasnt happened.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Ok... many many people have been killed in Africa because of the policies of the countries in the EU, South America, Asia, and so on.... this hypocrisy annoys me. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Fixed it for you. Any Anti-Choice advocate obviously cares more about a cell than a woman. I believe the word for it is " Sexism ". I myself think women are worth more than cells.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The Pro-Death people believe some humans are worth more than others... I believe the word for it is " Discrimination ". I assume you think an unborn is " a cell " but they are just not. The unborn has a sex at any point during a pregnancy... so sexism doesn't really play a role. These " anti-choice " just don't think you should have a choice about what humans you find worthy of life... seems reasonable to me. Perhaps this article reflects more the " pro death " position than the " anti-choice " one. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Well, i believe women are worth more than cells. You just stated, in fancy wording, that you didnt, and that you thought it was reasonable. Fixed it for you again<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I agree with you 100%... my point was that " anti-choice " isn't as bad as they are trying to make it. It is almost funny when someone uses it. It is also true that someone that uses it ( unless in a joking manner ) probably doesn't understand the opposite position at all. Woman are cells... So what you are telling me is that women are worth more than women... that makes no sense. What you are trying to do is state that an unborn human is worth less than a women. I find it sad that you wish to rank humans but I suppose you have no problem ( in reasoning atleast ) with someone ranking blacks less than whites or jews less than others... etc. You misquote me again and you get reported. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Women are REAL humans who feel REAL pain. I find it sad that YOU try to rank humans. But, even more sad, you think that the cell is worth MORE than a woman. Another completely moot comparison. " The color of skin makes no difference. What is good and just for one is good and just for the other, and the Great Spirit made all men brothers. " - White Sheild In other words, Blacks, Jews, and Whites are pretty much the same. Sadly i am forced to rank lives, becaues PLs are demolishing common sense as we know it. Im sure as hell not going to let them run around and deny our women reproductive rights. You have forced me to rank life because you are valuing cells more than women. And yes, i am trying to state than an unborn stomach cell is worth less than a women, because you XXXXXX are trying to kill women in order to save stomach cells. I claim my first victory.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3454_108_107__109_110_113_115_116_117_118_6<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I think that has been covered extensively but I will try for you one more time...... It is very sad that there are unwanted children in orphanages. I thin kwe can all agree on that.......... At least the children have a chance at life.... There are a lot of children who grew up in orphanges have gone out to be great Americans.......... Why should a baby in the womb not have at least that same opportunity?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It certainly would be nice if that baby got the same opportunity as babies whose mother chose to carry them to term. However the choice to carry that baby to term is the mother's choice, and not ours. It is regrettable if a woman chooses not to carry her baby to term, and even more regrettable if she does so without being informed of the associated risks and costs of whatever abortion procedure is being used. However, it is much more regrettable for us to deny that woman her personal autonomy in the matter. We cannot force her to submit her body to the interests of other people, including her unborn child. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You must know that about half the people in the U.S. disagree with you as does God.....<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well then, I'm sure that half the people in the US are also glad that the West won both WWII or the Cold War, and that they don't have to live in a country where personal autonomy and freedom is being eroded in the name of a state ideology. Also, God mentioned to me that you're misquoting him and in fact he agrees that freedom of will is paramount in this matter. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>God according to the bible believes in the sanctity of life and that all life is precious......... That is what is taught through the RCC of which I am a member........<br><b> S2:3-  </b>God, according to my religion, holds that the value of life is determined by what is done to produce produce and sustain that life. We may not live at the unwilling expense of others. So God teaches us by the Book. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well that is your religion and it must not follow the bible and the teachings of Jesus Christ............<br><b> S2:4-  </b>True. It would be against the Word of God to be a Christian or to follow the Bible. As Gamaliel points out in the Bible, that which is of God will flourish despite all opposition, and that which is against God will perish in due time. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>hmmmmmm OK :)</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3454_19_17__21_22_24_30_32_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I really don't know the situation in the u. s but over here there are actualy more foster parent's and adoptive parent's waiting to be aproved than we have that are aproved if we cut all the red tape we would process prospective parents a lot quicker and the childrens homes and such will begin to empty. Of course you will always have the crisis children that is something only humanity can help. Have you ever thought of adopting or fostering a crisis child? Not being bitchy just a little plug for my little mates who need parent's. :)<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The situation in America is appaling ( I don't have the exact figures but I'm shure some kind soul on this forum will provide them. ) Yes I have worked with some of these children, and my sister is a foster care provider. I can't even begin to describe some of the emotional and physical scars some of these kids carry... It breaks my heart to see and the thought of more entering this system brings me to tears. Again... Let's fix the mess we have now then worry about what might be. P.S. I've acutally had one of these childern tell me they whish nthey had never been born.... I told him I was glad he was here. He was moved a few weeks later and I haven't seen him since. I hope he finds someone else who is glad he's here.. and says so! <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I hope he finds some real parents soon it sucks when they keep moving these kids around they have enough turmoil to deal with as it is.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>My point exactly!! So lets quit this crazy argument over abortion and get thes kids some homes!! This is here and now let's take care of it first then move to those who are not yet here. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>What is wrong with speaking out for the innocents i devote equal amounts of time to both my causes?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So you provide care for or have adopted a homeless child I take it If so bless you the world needs more people like you. But I still don't think all those out there at abortion clinics have given as much.. and in My opinion they should start at the living not the unborn. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I foster crisis children I would love to be able to take all the children who need a home but unfortunatly that isn't realistic. I did start at the living and now i am on to the unborn but that does not stop me taking in the poor little mites that are brought to my door by social services at 2 or 3 oclock in the morning as i said what is wrong with speaking out for the innocents?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3682_103_87__104_105_106_107_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I never said it was illegal... there is no law outlawing it. I said there is no law saying abortion is ok. So why is no one enforcing it? Probably because we believe that the Supreme Court can set policy. huh? You put words in my mouth and I never said that. It is the wrongful killing of a life. What is wrong then? Well, I don't set what is wrong and I don't believe a government does either but rather should draw from it. The belief would be a standard of what is right and wrong. However, if you have no government does that mean it is ok for someone to steal from you? You would be ok with this as you would find nothing wrong with it because no law says it is wrong. well, try looking at it from the babies shoes. I think he / she might say something different. Still wondering where that " right to personal autonomy " comes from as no one has really given me a real answer. The unborn is forced to be killed. I am not talking about the women being compared to the Jews... I am comparing the unborn.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It was an observation, not a quotation ;) Well, that is the issue here - you say that abortion is wrong and murder ( I guess you mean an abortion by choice as opposed to medical need, but maybe you think any abortion is murder ) but where does that view come from? I mean, it is far less qualified than the complex balance of opinion that decides national law on abortion that draws on expertise from all parties in the debate. But despite this arbitary position ( you choose to ignore the reasons of the for allowing abortion, unlike the law which has considered them ) you expect to be taken seriously - that will never happen as long as you continue to do the intellectual equivalent of giving so many important issues the finger. How can any such approach become a " standard of right and wrong " when you are deaf to the reality of the issue as a whole? I think theft is wrong, government or no government. I also think a woman should have some control over the fact that nature has given her all the responsibility in growing a baby, government or no government. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>you think theft is wrong without government.. you said the following... Would you like to clarify your position?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The law is how we articulate notions such as theft being wrong into meaning in society - theft is not right, but it is the law that gives that definition and meaning through the punishment the state bestows on those found guilty of that crime. The same is true without law - people are still going to be ticked off if someone steals from them, but what you do about that has no boundaries except that which the individual chooses to observe. Anyway Steeeeve, you failed to respond to my previous statement : Or has the cat got your tongue? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No the cat is sitting on her window seat. And I did not fail to reply to your statement, I just didn't realise a response was wanted. So what is your question?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Perhaps you missed the question marks, so I've put them in bold for you this time : There you go.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3682_54_53__56_57_59_62_64_65_66_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Jew is spelled with a capitol J.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>lol... completely odd and ironic. I am sure he meant Jew and you meant capital.. so lets leave it there :) <br><b>S1:2-  </b>So STEEEEVE ; How many lives have you saved, thru MTM, CPR, etc., huh? And at least I can spell a major faith properly ; even a three lettered one.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>glad to know you bring spelling into this. Shows where you are in the argument. And where did the life saving question come from? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Since you happen to be pro-life, this retired P.A. would like to know how many lives have you gone out of your way to save by learning the life-saving practices of MTM, CPR, or the Heimlich Manuever ; or is your love for the fetus only, not all of mankind.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>My love is for all people. However, I know you will be respectful and not inquire about my personal past in farther. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I'm not asking you about the direct past, since you have no medical training, but when will you learn CPR, MTM, The Heimlich Manuever, so you can save lives in the future? Life seems important to you, and this is in no way disrespectful.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I never said half those things that you claim. That is all I wish to say on this matter. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Those who actually care about saving a life, go out of their way to learn those simple procedures. They don't just go on and on about a procedure, if Roe is reversed, will place more women's lives in peril.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10856_31_21__34_37_45_46_48_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>sinjin and gansao, Are you against FORCING people to have a background check prior to owning a handgun or FORCING people who own a business to pay for insurance offering contraception or FORCING people to purchase health insurance in general? I just want to understand what the criteria is for forcing something upon others in your mind.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>A background check is meant to exclude one from the list of those prohibited from legally purchasing firearms. The transvaginal ultrasound in question serves no public interest other than to attempt to discourage women from obtaining a legal medical procedure because it is morally repugnant to some. As far as the contraception question goes, I think it is like other lifestyle choices that are personal and should not be open to picking and choosing by the employer. Comprehensive medical coverage is just that. Otherwise employers could decide not to cover any sort of lifestyle choices made by employess they didn't like. Overeating, smoking, too much procreating, alcohol related treatment. I asked before and I'll ask again. If the church is against out of wedlock births should they be able to deny maternity benefits to an unmarried employee? How is that different? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>So forcing something is not really the problem so much as whether or not " forcing " is in the public interest. To you it is not but to others it might be, yes?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The procedure is neither in the public interest nor that of the patient's. It's legal coercion inspired by religion. When my son was born I was " required " to listen to a 15 minute lecture on why circumcision was now a bad thing before I could have my son cut. I found it offensive since the lecture had nothing to do with medicine. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>That's for the public to decide now isn't it. Nevertheless, my point was that " forcing " was never really the issue... just whether or not you agree with THAT to be forced since you don't believe their is an interest. I'm fine if you think it is a bad law because it doesn't serve a valid purpose but don't say " forcing " is the reasoning behind it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I don't think so. Public will is subordinate to the Constitutional rights of the individual. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Right but you said " public interest " and that would clearly be defined by the public. Nothing discussed on this thread has any constitutional questions.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7875_5_4__6_8_11_12_15_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Because you cannot reverse an incorrect United States Supreme Court decision with a ballot. Simple as that. Additionally, prior to 1973, abortion was already settled democratically in most states. And, regardless of whether 99.9% of the people in the US approve of the court's decision in Roe, that decision would still be judicial activism, and as such, would still merit reversal by the Supreme Court.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>No more so than the Scalia / Uncle Clarence Thomas cabal opining that the words NO LAW mean something other than what they do when they rule in a First Amendment case. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I doubt you can cite Scalia as an activist in First Amendment cases when he has voted to overturn bans on flag burning. You really should try to think before you speak ; or perhaps you actually did, in which case we should simply conclude that you have no idea what you are talking about. Regardless, any decision that holds that something is in the Constitution, when in fact it really is not, is wrong and merits reversal no matter which judges perpetrate the wrong decision.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So then, are we to presume that you would favor the sale and distribution of, to take the worst possible example, kiddie porn with no restrictions? After all, the First Amendment says " Congress shall make NO LAW abridging freedom of the press. BTW, re. Texas v. Johnson : Is a flag burning speech, and where in the Constitution does it say so? I agree with the decision, which simply goes to prove that even a blind Antonin can find a peanut now and then. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No, we should not presume that. In fact, I support legislation banning the same because the Constitution has never, ever protected obscenity. In fact, its original import was far less protective of certain categories of speech than it even is today. Is sign language speech? You agree with the decision, but evidently for the wrong reasons.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You can favor banning it all you want ; just remember that this is exactly the same type of " legislating from the bench " you have decried. Can you spin the words NO LAW in any other manner than NO LAW? And Scalia and Uncle Clarence Thomas call themselves " Textualists ". Old Nino himself said so on 60 Minutes when Leslie Stahl skewered him but good. HUMBUG!! They write their personal predilections into their opinions just as much as any other Justice. It's just that you like their biases. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>No, it isn't. The question is not whether congress can make a law, the question is : what is " the freedom of exercise, speech, press, assembly. " These terms have objective, historic meaning, and from that it is clear that the First Amendment does not prohibit Congress ( or state legislatures ) from prohibiting the possession or distribution of obscenity. The First Amendment also happens not to cover many other forms of " speech / press. " For example, under the objective and historic meaning of the First Amendment, Congress certainly may ban a news agency from publishing nuclear secrets, etc. Actually, Scalia and Thomas are originalists. Originalism uses textualism as a starting point in Constitutional construction. No, they really don't. And no, I don't like or dislike their alleged biases.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-6182_16_14__19_20_24_28_30_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>So its their fault if the condom breaks?

Why don't you want them to pay for the abortion..o r part of it. It is the fault of the maker is it not? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Its nobody's fault. Why do you always have to blame someone.

Unless some one would next consider all pro-lifers to be nut cases also.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You said : Linus responded with this but not that you refer only to " pro-lifers " in the above statement. You responded... clarifying what you meant by your comments. This shows that you use " pro-lifers " and " pro-life nut cases " as the same thing.... maybe you wish to clarfiy this though. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So some how a clarification is me stating all?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I'm just wondering why you said " pro-lifers " and then couldn't believe that Linus didn't know you were talking about " pro-life nut jobs " as if they were one in the same... so do you believe pro-lifers are all nut jobs? Do you believe pro-lifers believe in blowing up abortion clinics? If not... thats all you gotta say. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Not all just some to both questions.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Very well then ; I would like to add that " nut jobs " are not limited to pro-life... sadly it is not limited to anything. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>ROFLMAO :) Y'all are funny today thanks :) True oh so true at times, I will admit, I tend to fall into that nut job catagory</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10872_100_99__103_108_110_113_114_115_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Yes : Adolph Hitler was lying when he said " we was a socialist ".<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Are the above to quotes contradictory? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No they're not contradictory : Hitler was not a socialist. In his early years he convinced the public that that was the direction he was going because ; as I said, it was popular to do so. In his early years he was a populist and said things that people wanted to hear. If you'd really like an education on his popularism, watch the movie Triumph of the Will ( 1935 ) - IMDb It was done in 1935 when Hiter's popularity had peaked, and by 1935 Auswitch had been opened for two years as prison for political prisoners. Also during 1935 he began his designs on the east. He hid from the public and most of his military contacts all of his designs : that's what it made it work so well ; nobody knew what he was doing at any given time. It was all ' need to know '. The Wehrmach hated him and so did the government. He supplanted the government with his sympathizers and the SS took care of the pressure on the military brass.

Again, the earliest records of abortion are in 2600 BC - and Sumerian culture lived way before then, not to mention that there were many other cultures that found murder sinful.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Murder has only been around since the concept of law has been around to define it as such. And even then it was a very narrow definition as well considering that it only applied to members of each tribe or city and not to those outside. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>So if one man from a tribe murdered a child from the same tribe, he wouldn't be punished?

I don't have to prove one doesn't exist as the burden of proof is on you. Now I asked a simple question so can you find me one or not?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Except in cases of common knowledge, then you must provide differently. It is common knowledge that we have the right to our organs because consent is required before they are harvested. I have answered your question before, yet you keep asking it. Did you simply not understand? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If you have answered it then please refer to it. Common knowledge is not law by the way. You clearly said a LEGAL right. In fact, I am not even saying a law or court case is not out there... I just wanna see one ( however, there is an odd case about not having an absolute right to your own resources ). So I ask for the third time... where is this legal right? I would even be happy with link to another post. No international law please and no ' implied ' rights as this would be begging the question ( since we all love the fallacies ).<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I did not say common knowledge was law, I said if something is common knowledge there is no burden of proof. The burden of proof is then on the one denying it. The legal right is in the fact that it cannot be restricted. If there is no law preventing you from doing something, you cannot be legally stopped. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I can't show you every law to show you it is not in there... I was asking for a law that shows that. If this right was " legal " then it would be a written law for one. Also, one would be able to use drugs on their own body because one would have the right to their own body. So I am not sure this law legally does exist. I just wanna know where it is if there is a law.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Nor can I show you every law to show you that you have the right to your own body. You can, however, show a law or case or precedent showing where the right to one's organs and life-processes is limited. Not so. As in the Constitution, any powers not specifically limited to the Federal Gov't belong to us. They don't need to be specified. Again, you misrepresent what the pro-choice argument is. It is a desire to prevent something from happening to ones body, not to use it in anything a woman desires.

Meanwhile the pro-life position remains the same throughout this process. The unborn has a right to live period end of story.

It's a moral issue, so why are you surprised that a Christian would take the moral, pro-life position?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Actually, the prolife amoral position of enslaving women is not particularly Christian. The Christian prochoice position of seeing the woman as a person in her own rights, that is certainly moraly defensible. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>That's the first time that I've heard protecting an innocent unborn human being deemed " amoral ". I guess if you have no moral compass anything can be considered true north.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well, I guess you never before pondered how amoral you are in seeking to enslave the woman. I am not surprised, as the PL rarrely see the woman as anything but a walking womb. Misogyny like that is rampant in the PL community. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Your rhetoric doesn't match reality.

Is it simply its teaching on abortion? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The refusal of the church to allow women to serve in the priesthood. The denial of leadership roles within the church to women. The view of women as less than human, as merely wombs that become the property of fertilized eggs, zygotes, embryos, fetuses, etc., should a woman become pregnant.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>How does this show disrespect of women in your opinion. Perhaps we should start a new thread on this in the religion forum or go back to your old thread there that has the same theme?? THat women are less than human is not a teaching of the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church is very inclusive in its definition of who is human. It is more inclusive of larger society and the world as a whole. When the world is saying that the unborn are not human and that people who are elderly, frail, and medically compromised have no value or purpose, or that it is okay to end someone's life by withholding food and water without the presence of a living will then the Catholic Church stands up and says that all of these are humans and worthy of life, love, and protection. The Catholic Church actually teaches that we are all more than human to be exactly correct. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>In response to my statements, The refusal of the church to allow women to serve in the priesthood, and, The denial of leadership roles within the church to women, you say : Obviously, women are considered by the Roman Catholic Church to be unfit to be priests and to hold leadership roles within the church. Why else would women be so excluded from those roles?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Simone, Women are not considered to be unfit to be priests. A woman cannot be a priest just like a man cannot be a nun. It's not about being unfit. It's about trying to fulfill a role that is contrary to one's nature. As Father Fessio explained Sunday on Meet the Press, the Church is spoken of in scripture as the bride of Christ and Christ is the bridgegroom. Priests succeed Christ and a woman cannot be a bridegroom and have a nuptial arrangement with a bride. It doesn't work.

" I will never accept that a week after conception or 8 or 10 for that matter, we are talking about a person yet. I'm a " conditional " pro-choicer.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Actually, I agree with you somewhat. I would not be nearly as worried about very early abortion as I would mid to late term. And I can accept abortion if the life of the mother is at definite risk. I guess that makes me a " conditional " pro-lifer. I think most likely many, many people on both sides take their stance to varying degrees. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Would that not mean then that to have an abortion or not, regardless of motivation, is an issue best left between a woman and her doctor? Most doctors are not prepared to do late term abortions for the woman's convenience. Most doctors have morality. Most doctors are religious to some degree. Most doctors try to adhere to their oath to do no harm. Most doctors have children.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It's not that simple. Abortion is a pretty complicated issue and to assume the mother and doctor should be able to kill an unborn child at will is is grisly prospect. At the least there should be some control on something that powerful. The partial birth ban is a start. And who said doctors were always above reproach anyway? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Why trivialize the decision of the woman and the doctor by terming it as " at will ". Can you not grant that the reasons could be sound even if they are no business of yours? I see no reason to assume a doctor's morality is more suspect than anyone else. Indeed no one is above reproach. Not even evangelicals. Would you agree that the term " unborn child " is an exaggeration prior to some point in a pregnancy?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I have already said that I can accept abortion if the life of the mother is in danger. That should answer your question. No more than saying it is an exagerration when an expecting mother herself calls what she has inside of her " my baby. " I don't have any problem with that at all, but it seems that you would if you are determined to exclude any terms for it other than " fetus. " <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I am not determined to do anything, least of all what you suggest. Is it not possible that an expectant mother might " exaggerate " a bit in anticipation of what is coming. How many cells equal a " baby ", 2, 4, 8, 16, 32? Is that the whole strategy? Harder to kill a " baby " than a " fetus "?

And while many Republicans and Independents have likewise abrogated their moral responsibilities to the unborn, their moral turpitude pales in comparison to the dedicated left wing pro-infanticide crowd, and Barack Obama in particular. Those were future prophets to the nations and the Savior of mankind in the womb.

This immune response is identical to how the immune system sometimes reacts to an organ transplant when rejection occurs - following your logic ( as before ), a transplanted organ is not part of the recipient's body.

Ultimately, though, I would probably not, for a couple of reasons. Firstly, there is no real attachment between host and tapeworm - it's simply that the tapeworm has got it's teeth into the wall and isn't letting go. Secondly, the tapeworm is an organism in it's own right. Yes, I know you think a foetus is also - you have yet to show, however, that such a scientific consensus exists. As a matter of fact... Merriam-Webbster defines the placenta as the " organ in mammals except monotremes and marsupials that unites the fetus to the maternal uterus " ( bold mine ). Just in case you were wondering about that bolded word - the first definitions for unite are " 1 a : to put together to form a single unit " or " 1 a : to become one or as if one ", depending on context. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Short on time ; Can you tell me ( in mammals ) which organism creates and developes the placenta?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Wikipedia tells all - " The placenta develops from the same sperm and egg cells that form the fetus, and functions as a fetomaternal organ " In short - it originates from the zygote, but is considered part of both foetus and mother - hence the ' unite ' in Merriam-Webster, I would imagine. However, asking ' what organism does the placenta come from ' is a loaded and misleading question, as the zygote is not an organism. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>No, Ian... check the DNA.

In fact, I think that there are times where NOT having an abortion is the immoral choice.

If that was the case, you and I would not have different moral stances on abortion.... or anything else. Morals are not absolute. They never have been. The very idea lies somewhere between ridiculous and moronic. As has been amply demonstrated here for you before, morals have been fluid throughout history. So, now that we have put that silliness behind us, please answer the question. Where in the constitution do you see power for the federal government to regulate abortion? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Why?

Because we can look at historical moral paradigms and recognize that they have shifted over time. No, its not. And where is that? I have read the constitution a few times and have never seen anything that would tend to suggest that the federal government has the power to regulate murder. That would fall under the individual states police power. There is a federal law against murder, but it only applies under a few specific circumstances such as murders that occur on federal property, or if the murdered individual is a federal agent, occurs in an area under federal jurisdiction but not inside a state ( such as DC ), etc... So, unless you bang a federal agent and then have the baby aborted on a military base somewhere, the federal government should have nothing to say about it. I am OK with that. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>And?

These women need to either protect themselves from preagnancy or dont have sex and for the love of god do not use abortion as a birthcontrol.

Either you have been duped into believing that those abortions are representative of the whole, or you know that they aren't but pretend that they are. Either way, you have some work to do.

This means after conception occurs. You said it ONLY works this way if you START the pill AFTER you became pregnant. That is not what I said.

Thus, rarely the BCP is an abortifacient even if you have been taking the pill all along. Good god, man.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>During the first month of taking the pill you have a chance to get pregnant and thus implantation may not happen after conception. I'm fully aware of this but I was under the impression that after the first month this does not happen. I could be wrong, It has been some time since I've read up on the birth control pill.

Your initial claim that I am challenging is this one : When speaking to the issue of abortion, you say that it is wrong to impose one's personal moral code onto someone else, i.e., it would be wrong to outlaw abortion. Then I asked : To which you responded : So in the case of murder, you say it is right to impose one's personal moral code onto someone else, i.e., it would be right to outlaw murder. Thus you have now claimed 1 ) that it is wrong to impose one's own personal moral code onto someone else and 2 ) it is right to impose one's own personal code onto someone else. 1 ) these claims are inconsistent with each other, and 2 ) the second claim directly contradicts your first claim that " it is dead wrong to force your morals upon someone else.

This is more of a general liberty that doesn't really define much other than being free. This kind of fits with the other 2 which are life and property which seem to be general terms as well. You don't have a right to life no matter what. Even so you can have any of these taken away by Due Process of law. however, does liberty mean actual liberties as the courts now a days are thinking. IF this is true then there are certain liberties the constitution guarentees but what are they? I am not all certain this was the purpose of the word liberty.

( Similar answer as above ) If you walk down a dark alley, knowing there is a risk of being mugged and / or attacked and also knowing full well that there is a safer route, and then you get attacked, is it tragic? Sure, but it's also your own fault. Will I feel sorry for you? Of course.

Should you arrive one day at your house and discover a burglar who clearly poses no threat to your person, you may not legally kill him though he walk out with all your earthly possessions. Yes, the burglar may be infringing upon your liberty, but you may not kill him because of that. If you must analogize it to the burglar, than it would apply this way. Most pro-life people agree that abortions that are necessary to save the mother's life are acceptable. What most pro-lifers do not agree with is that abortion is acceptable in situations where only a person's liberty or property might be infringed, but where it would not be necessary to save her life. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not in all states.

It's actually an interesting read, in my opinion. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If someone broke into your house in order to cause you pain are you legally allowed to kill them?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>" Deadly physical force cannot be used unless the actor reasonably believes that the attacker is using or about to use deadly physical force or inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm. " I doubt that all pain amounts to " great bodily harm. " In that respect, it is very circumstantial. If someone breaks into your house and wants to punch you in the fact, but the victim does not perceive that the attacker is or is about to inflict deadly force upon him, then the victim may only repel the attack with the force that is reasonable to repel the attack. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>That fits the description.

You can't have it both ways.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes, I can. Everything has emotion behind it, however basing something soley on emotion is stupid. Every law we make is because of emotions, however logic and reason are the primarily what are used when deciding to or not to enact a law. Making a law that says anyone who bullies another should be sent to a work camp and spend their lives there is based on emotion, however it is not logical. The law against murder however, is to deter more murders from happening and therefore stopping murders, preventing emotional distress. This is logical, because society would degrade if murder were legal. Making abortion illegal however, is based soley on emotion. Sure, seeing things that slightly resemble humans being killed can be emotionally disheartening, however when logic, reason, and science are used you will discover that these little creatures have no mental existence. Therefore, there is no reason for them to have rights, because mental existence is the basis for rights.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8094_465_462_1_467_469_470_472_12<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I just find it hypocritical that if I punch a pregant woman in the stomach and she misscarries I murdered someone while if she got an abortion its a-ok.

Heck using that arguement I can blame the mother for her body not being fit enough to carry a child to term if she miscarries. Therefore by not keeping herself healthy she killed the ZEF. Ugh... I'm pro-choice but some of choicers arguements make me disgusted. ZEF's don't count as being human ( unless of course someone other than a licensed physican with the apporval of the mother kills it : roll eyes : That makes buckets of sense ) and no person under the age of 7 can be tried for murder anyway. >_> What's next we start sending little kids who steal candy from the store to jail?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So then you admit that the ZEF was manipulating " its source of food and shelter " for its own good, which is exactly what a parasite does. Weird. BTW-many parasites kill their host. Sorry, try again. First of all it's HER body, and therefore her property and she can do with it as she pleases. Second of all that's not why women have miscarriages Criminally negligent homicide works just as well <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And last I checked the ZEF didn't kill the woman because it wanted too. >_> And most human beings can argueably be considered parasites anyway. Ugh nevermind you think the ZEF is some alien life form that should either have all or no human rights. I agree. Its an object. So if I kill it I assaulted the woman nothing more nothing less. There is no mother right to choose to get rid of her offspring its a mother's choice to get rid of something growing inside of her. And if I make that choice for her I simply attacked her body I didn't kill anyone. ^_^ There's no one to kill.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Tell that to the dead pregnant woman BTW-a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that a pregnant woman is more likely to be a victim of homicide than to die of any other cause.

Hilarious. Go to planned parenthood site, click on pregnancy, and then on the " how pregnancy occurs " flash animation. I was not sure if I would be allowed to link it here. Warning : may not be suitable for some viewers, especially those with no sense of humor.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It was interesting.... Like always though, PP doesn't do a great job of giving the full story. When pregnancy begins is up for debate just like everything else... although I don't see why it matters really. http://www.advancedfertility.com/earlypre.htm It is what it is no matter what you call it. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>But in the terms of this debate, it does not matter when pregnancy begins. I didn't mean to use the cartoon as an argument, I just thought it was hilarious. As far as your other question above about the 99% of " regular abortions ", I guess I would answer this. Personally, I only could support the decision for my wife to have an abortion in the events of danger to her health, or rape. However, I do not think that I have any right ot push my beliefs on others, and what is right for me, might not be right for someone else. Do I agree with abortion being used as birth control, no. But, do I think some people make the best choice by terminating an unwanted pregnancy rather than bring another unwanted child into the world... yes.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I will just restate what I was referring to earlier... there is no " best choice " when it comes to whether or not you can take the life of another ( unjustly... ie non-self defense ). I can't think of any situation where it would be ok for me to kill my neighbor and for it to be just. Even if they caused my life to be a living hell ( and oddly they do sometimes ). I am all for pushing my beliefs on other people when it comes to harming someone. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And this is the problem. Anti-abortion advocates view the fetus as " someone ". Pro-choice advocates view the fetus as " something ".<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No arguement there.

I was simply stating that according to the law, abortion is not murder in the United States. That is a fact. You are also correct that human slavery as well as indentured servitude are presently illegal in the US. Forcing a woman into compulsory gestation for months, a mandatory labor and a requisite birthing process is illegal as well. But in service to your personal beliefs I guess you think that it is acceptable.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Actually, there are exceptions to that statement. For example, a murderer that also causes the death of a fetus can be charged with a double homicide. Since that's possible, then there must be instances in which the State see abortion as murder. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>There aren't. If you find any please let me know.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Careful, your ignorance of the law is showing. :) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You are correct. I should have been clearer. I was speaking of abortion as a medical procedure.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Again, from my previous reference. " Some of these laws do not contain exceptions for the woman or her doctor, which could possibly allow criminal proceedings for measures taken as a course of treatment ( radiation treatment for cancer or antibiotics ) or for abortion. " <br><b>S1:4-  </b>There are many laws on the books that the Supreme Court has determined are unconstitutional. That is why you will hear legal scholars ( even conservative ones like Justice John Roberts ) say that Roe v. Wade is the law of the land. That is why you do not see any states prosecuting a woman for murder when she has had an abortion. There are also laws on the books ( such as in Texas ) against oral sex, interracial marriage and other things. A lot of the times state legislatures do not repeal all the specific laws that are rendered unconstitutional because of a Supreme Court decision. They just law fallow and are rendered useless. So technically you are right that the laws still exist, but legally they are not enforceable or technically legal -- which is what I was addressing.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Rread the following link and you'll see that we aren't talking about archaic laws that just haven't been repealed. Many are recently enacted laws that probably haven't been enforced against abortions because the " time " wasn't right.

If they are so hard then why do we have them? If they cause that much pain while are they legal? Also... whats the womens rights stuff? Do women have more rights then men? I think we all have equal rights... at least in the US.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So you oppose the treatment of STDs. Your position is duly noted. Heart surgeries are hard and cause a lot of pain. So why don't we just stop doing them? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>What? When did I say you can't treat STDs... treating an STD doesn't exactly kill a person. I guess you can not have heart surgery if you don't want... you are just dooming yourself.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Just like you can or cannot have abortions depending on whether yu want to or not. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No... this kills a kid....

Theres the outside possibility that she, for reasons of her own, may have had an abortion herself and doesn't take too kindly to those who criticize this practice as this is intrepeted, by her, as an indictment on her character. But, that is only a guess. She did mention that a man bailed on her and left her high and dry. I can understand her bitterness towards men even if I don't agree with it. None of my commentary is pointed directly at her but you know what they say, if the shoe fits, wear it.

And let's not forget the psychological effects, also : Post-abortion trauma, depression, suicide, need I go on? Your claim that abortion is less threatening to the woman is bogus.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I think whether abortion or pregnancy is riskier depends on access to safe medical care and the health of the mother. Whether a rape victim will experience more stress aborting or carrying that pregnancy to term will depend on the life circumstances, health and mind-set of woman. I know good and well I could abort a pregnancy of rape and not blink an eye. As it is - both Captain America and Bassman have never been through either methinks.

Anyway, no number of stats will change my mind. It is infinately insulting to me as a grown woman that some total stranger thinks they know better than me what is best for my life, health, and state of mind. Abortion needs to be reduced by addressing how we raise girls, education, access to medical care and birth control and by helping women get all their needs met when pregnant. The right to make their own decisions should under no circumstance be taken from them. Ever. I have been raped and I have been a battered wife. I will break the neck of the next person who thinks they have any rights over my body for any reason. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>But does that mean that you need to be angry?

Nor would I try to patronize you in any way. I just want you to see that there is a better way to handle life than being angry. I was wrongly convicted of a felony crime eight years ago and have harbored bitterness for a long time against the investigators. I came to the conclusion that I needed to forgive not only myself, but ( and this may be hard to grasp ) forgive those who railroaded me. I think that it might help to forgive those who attacked you. As I said, I wouldn't even try to patronize you and forgive me if I am.

At that point " elective " abortion becomes illegal, although the law is worded in quite a loose way that allows later abortions to be performed for a variety of reasons.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>there is no US law deciding when this is. However, I fail to see the difference in someone that can live on their own ( which a new-born can't do either ) and someone that can... they are both still a " someone " and do grant a " right " to kill some innocent people and let some others live seems a bit wrong. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The point of viability is at that time the baby stands a reasonable chance of surviving birth and early development, its not an concept concerned with " someone that can live on their own " as such.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>what makes this person different from one that can't survive? They are still both people... do you suggest we discriminate against certain people? Also, at one time does the unborn reach this stage?

Seems inconsistent <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Trying to strike the balance between two conflicting interests is what : the need for a woman to have control over her pregnancy and the need of the state to provide legal protection to the unborn..... I'm surprised you haven't noticed that. Do you suggest we live in a world free from discrimination?

I'm not interested in those who decide to keep the child ( good luck to them ) but individuals who want the course of their life to be altered as little as possible by their ordeal. Do would you force them to carry that child? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I did in fact answer your question, now I shall answer this one. What is worse, to be forced to carry a baby due to rape or to die because your father was a rapist? Besides rape accounts for less then 0.001% of the 46 million American    s killed due to abortions. You wouldn    t even subject the rapist to death so why kill the innocent victim ; can you not see that you want to destroy the only good that has come from the incident?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>With regard to the former, horrific I guess. As to the latter die is an inappropriate word, as is killed etc. If you were to say " or to never exist because your father was a rapist? " I would have to say I expect no right to exist as a result of a rape. If the mother victim decides to bear me till I am born, I'm fortunate for that grace. You are advocating a draconian imposition on the victims of rape - to use your figures thats around 45000 women you have denied the chance to reassert control over their lives. No, but I oppose the death penalty on the basis that if a miscarriage of justice occurs there is no way to recscind the sentence, and that criminal justice has moved on from capital punishments of centuries gone by. As to your reference to " the only good " that can only be viewed from the perspective of the woman who has been raped. If she decides to see the pregancy through, that is her perogative. If however she wants to terminate the pregnancy I can see no valid reason to oppose her wishes - she has been attacked, violated : why should she have to sacrifice yet more of herself? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I don't see the point in debating with you when you fail to do basic maths.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3617_55_53__56_68_72_74_78_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Oh that is bad forcing pregnancy, - your forcing death on little humans, and that is worse, I'll take the lesser evil any day.

Ah, now your making the classic pro-life mistake. It's not about killing the baby. Thats just a sucky side effect. It's about having the right to control your own body. Society should definately have the right to make a pregnant woman make her own way in the world. No one should have to care for her if they don't want to. However, there is an extremely large gap between not providing care for her, and forcing her to carry a baby to term. In fact, the two are completely unrelated. The same with your neighbour analogy. There is no correlation between your obligation ( or lack thereof ) to provide a duty of care for him, and any right you may have to kill him. A woman is pregnant. She refuses to care for the baby. The baby is removed, and since it is too young to survive, it dies. A similar analogy would be : A person comes across an injured person in the street. They refuse to give aid to the injured person. As a result, the injured person dies. It would NOT be : You come across a person in the street, and decide to kill them. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>If you and I were rock climbing and we had an accident, which resulted in you dangling off a ridge with your only lifeline being my leg, which you managed to grab in the accident, do I have the automatic right to remove you from my leg, which would send you to your death?

Let me ask you this rhetorically. Who is better to run your own life, the government or you? If you say " you " than is there a contradiction if you support murder laws? I don't think so and since abortion is murder I don't see that as a contradiction. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It's a contradiction since you say that the pregnant woman should have the right to choose whether or not to continue her pregnancy but you permit the government to hold the hammer of a murder charge over her head if she makes a choice that the government disapproves of. How is that NOT a contradiction? BTW, since in your mind abortion = murder, what penalty would you exact under the law and to whom should it be applied? The woman? The doctor? The person who drove the woman to the clinic ( accessory before the fact )?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, I never said that. I said she is better " to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy ". If by that you mean " right to choose to continue the pregnancy " than I would say if she chooses abortion than the government is better at determining the future of her pregnancy, otherwise the woman is. Perhaps you should be more clear in what you mean. Do you purposely ignore everytime I answer this question? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>This is gibberish. It seems that you support the right of a woman to make only the governmentally-approved choice. This is, of course, no choice whatsoever. Now, why not tell the forum just exactly WHY you think the government is " the government is better at determining the future of her pregnancy. " Why not tell the forum why you do not trust a woman's choice. Why not tell us why you are so sure that the government to which today you would give the power to criminalize abortion may not at some time in the future be the same government which will require it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>in the choice between killing the baby and not? Yes. exactly. I never said that. I said the government is better at determining you shouldn't kill your baby if you want to do that. I make it a habit not to trust people who want to kill others. I suppose they could but I would vote against them.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8582_2_1__3_4_8_9_7<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Why don't people quote thescriptures correctly instead of making it up as they go?

Not only are you impervious to logic, a lot of teachings have rolled off your back like rain does on a duck. I'm pro-choice, too. Within your right to have sex as you please, you have the choice of having unprotected sex and living with all of the consequences or the other choice of having protected sex and living with all the consequences. Either way, you have no right to violate the rights others, including the unborn ones that you " accidently " procreate.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Hey, no problem :) Like bullets off Superman Teachings? There is no law stating that you must " deal with " all consequences of an action if you can change them. Where in the world did you get that idea? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Here again is evidence of your misunderstanding of " consequences ".<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Oh? Where is my misunderstanding when I state that one does not have to endure all consequences of an action if one can change it? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>One usually has to endure the consequences of one's actions. One also has to endure the consequences of someone else's actions directed at them. Walking barefoot in the snow will likely give you pneumonia. Bumpin ' uglies without BC will likely make someone pregnant. Both of these are consequences that you have to deal with. How you deal with each depends of the available tools and your own behavior. Whether you choose to kill the fetus or give it a decent birth, you are dealing with the consequence of pregnancy. You didn't change the consequence of unprotected sex. You simply chose to kill. It's just pathetic that so many people equate pregnancy with catching a cold or something.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Oh, I agree. That was my point. You do not have to endure the consequences if you can change them. You do not have to endure pregnancy because you can choose abortion. Abortion is also a consequence. Saying " You have to deal with the consequences of your action, so abortion is not allowed " is what what I was arguing against. It's pathetic that so many people want to use pregnancy as a punishment for irresponsible behavior. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Herein lies more evidence of inadequacy. Abortion is not a consequence. Abortion is your solution to the consequence of getting pregnant from unprotected sex. It's your way of dealing with a consequence.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Now you're just quibbling. Abortion is a consequence. Abortion is a possible consequence of sex, it is a consequence of choosing to have an abortion, it is a consequence of telling your parents and having them force you into having one. Pregnancy is a possible consequence of sex, it is a consequence of choosing to have a boyfriend, it is a consequence of impaired judgement due to alcohol or pot. Abortion is a possible conseqence of pregnancy as well. It is very disingenuous to put about that it isn't a consequence. You could say it is a consequence of a consequence as well, but that does not negate that it is a consequence of the original action.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-4375_72_71__75_76_77_78_4<br><b>S1:1-  </b>There is another thing you failed to consider. That little child that is growing and developing has an eternal soul.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That eternal soul will return to God. God knows that soul was to be aborted, He chose it for that reason, a reason of His own. Every action has a purpose, that abortion had a purpose in the woman's life. Perhaps it will lead her to God later in life or the shock will lead to a more virtuous life, I don't know. Only God knows the purpose that abortion will serve. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The problem is that abortion is contrary to the will of God. You don't think for one minute that God won't hold the abortionindustry culpable for the spilling of innocent blood? You bet he will.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Nothing is contrary to the will of God. Everything that happens is known to Him and is according to His plan, the abortion industry included. It has a purpose, even if we do not see it now. Perhaps it is to lead those to God that would not otherwise see any evil in the world ( even perhaps yourself ). Those who cannot be in God's presence will not be in God's presence.

I think IT is what determines a person, not independent breathing. Because you can be on artificial lungs machine, then what, do you become a property of the machine or a hospital? Consciesness is what makes person a person. And a baby has it before it's born. Thus it is an independent person.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Problem is, the only reasonable test for consciousness is the Turing test. Which basically is run like this : Have a discussion with the subject. If you believe the subject is conscious, then they are conscious. Many people would fail the turing test due to brain disabilties or injuries, or through other medical conditions. Can't have a conversation with a person in a coma, can we? Also, almost all children and babies would fail the turing test. Responding the stimuli isn't a sign of being conscious. Single celled organisms respond to stimuli. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I thought of consciousness more of being self aware.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Indeed. Which is what the Turing test measures. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>but if a person can't speak for himself, then what, he's got not conscience? Like if he didn't learn to speak, or if he's just mute?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Sorry, my bad. When I described the Turing test, I over-simplified. In reality, you just communicate with the subject through whatever means suits both participants. This is the only way to really measure consciousness, and while it isn't perfect ( for the reasons you mentioned above ) it is the best we have. If someone or something is completely unable to communicate, then as much as we might think it is self aware and conscious, we cannot be sure. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So basically if you can get whatever form of reaction from the subject, you assume it has counscience?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Not exactly. I mean, I can get a reaction from a plant by giving it the right stimuli. That doesn't mean it is aware. The test is really simple. You communicate with the subject and if, at the end of this communication you believe the subject is self aware and conscious, then it is. There really aren't any other things to measure which will indicate consciousness. For example, you know I'm conscious ( and vice versa ) because of this back-and-forth conversation we are having. However, after a brief conversation with an automated ICQ messenger, we would both be able to tell we were talking to a simple computer program. Even though it would respond to our queries and comments, it's responses wouldn't indicate that it was self-aware and conscious. Not really related to the abortion issue, but interesting none the less. I find it extremely interesting in the field of computer programming and artificial intelligence.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-6421_123_122__136_138_142_151_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>So what about people who have abortions and already have a child or children?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Then they are getting out of the responsablitiy of taking of another child. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Well, I was keeping the responsibility I took on with my daughter, and if I had another child I would be living in poverty with her, and that's not something I was prepared to do.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So you are saying that you would not have another child right?

So Let me understand, are you against abortion in the second and third trimester? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Ah, so the fact that the infant could feel pain and the fact that the mother could have put it up for adoption ( thus removing it from her care without harming it ) means nothing? No, but the first trimester makes my point stronger, and given that 95 - 98% of abortions happen then it is a valid distinction.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes but you said all abortions were justified............. which is it?

Is autonomy the condition determining where you draw the line as to when eliminating the developing human life is acceptable or not? Let's look at the definition. Autonomous - existing and functioning as an independent organism. An independent organism? Yikes, that's certainly open to debate, isn't it? I mean, a 5 year old cannot rationally be considered independent of the mother. Do you support the mother's right to kill her 5 year old? I'm sure you don't. At what point do you consider ending a developing human life immoral? Oh that's right, it's not your decision to make. Slaves are made slaves completely against their will.

Try harder to understand the statements you respond to, or I won't bother responding to you anymore. Of course, there's a difference. I'm drawing a parallel DrDumb.

DrDumb ; that's real mature. I'm not against a person being in control of their own bodily activities. For example, a person should be able to shoot a gun. After all, they have a right to choose what they do with their own bodies, right? If somebody happens to be in the way of the gun, that's not the shooter's fault. That person should have moved. They are in control of their own body too, and if they don't choose to move, they are accepting the consequences of that action. Who are we to determine whether these people are moral in their actions? It should be left up to them. Children need adults to take care of them, so they are not actually autonomous.

In this case, it also goes to the hypocrisy of the criminal's argument, given that the murderer based his views on the Christian faith and dictum of not taking a life, and went into a Christian church on a Sunday and took a life. In a way, in his lunacy, I think he saw himself as God, and entitled to act as God. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>This man killed countless hundreds, possibly thousands, of innocent children before they were even born. He cut them up and threw them away in the dumpster behind his office like fast food leftovers. I find it particularly disgraceful that any church would allow a butcher / murderer like this to even set foot on the property.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Pure hyperbole. Please see my longer post to jyotsu. Ibid. Your initial premise is not established. Number two, even if it were, are you consistent in that view? For example, do you find it disgraceful that the Catholic Church, for example, allows non-penitent Holocaust participants to retain their status as Catholics? Do you think someone should go in there on Sunday with a gun, and take care of them, too? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>By who's decision? Again, by who's decision? Personally I find the whole religion to be highly questionable. Their stance against birth control even though it could cut down on the number of unwanted children in third world countries that're going to die an easily avoidable death, their belief that a woman becomes a saint upon having 12 children, and their soft hand approach to the pedophile priests, makes them a religion that I have no care for. I could care less about what happens to a bunch of catholics. Your attempt to confuse the issue and shift the nature of the discussion isn't going to work ; Tiller was a mass murderer of innocent children and who knows how many adult women. Simply because he struck one day or one week before the subject could legally be classified as a person is irrelevant and avoiding responsibility at its best. Had he not been killed by one person now, he would've eventually been arrested and given the death penalty for his actions.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The thinking community's consensus that statements of fact be established by evidence. On forums, that means cited articles following recognized rules for objective reporting in journalism. Ibid. You said that you objected to a church allowing a baby bucher to set foot in their house of worship. So are you now saying that you only object when it's a Lutheran church, but not a Catholic church? Again, even if we assume for a moment that you are right ( and you have not established that premise ) -- non-penitent Holocaust participants who are still allowed to attend Catholic churches murdered innocent children adn adult women, too. You are ignoring the realities of late-term abortions. Whereby the journalists took a statement out of context and deliberately did not allow the viewers to hear what the doctor was saying in its entirety. That is not true. He was lawfully practicing medicine.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8920_493_492__495_497_510_513_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Tiller was not the only physician who provided late-term abortions.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I was told that he was one of only a handful, and the only one in Kansas. My last post on this thread was based on that information, so if it is incorrect than I apologize. If it is true, than I am sure that Tiller had appointments that were set before his death that could not be kept and the financial obsticles to finding another Dr. in a timely manner should have caused actual births OR terrible complications since that is the only reason people get late term abortions.... according to some. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You may be correct about the state of Kansas. I was speaking of the nation of America, still granting liberty and justice to women, relatively speaking, not to mention being free to pursue happiness.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This is obviously very much a " women's " issue for you and I respect that. I don't know about the liberty and justice aspect, or the persuit of happiness aspect of your arguement, since I hate the use of abortion as birth control. From your posts I believe you feel the same way. From a constitutional point of view... Chuz-Life made me research that in detail and I can not find constitutional protections for the unborn. The Constitution clearly protects those born.., ie ; the woman. From a legal point of view, the outcome of R. v W. appears to have been correct. But I don't have to like it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>My view is that the rights of a fetus come more and more into play as a fetus reaches a point of viability viable outside of the womb. How to define these rights and their stages is a gray, murky area.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Chuz-Life has offered to show me where the constitutional rights extend into the womb. Until he does, I believe as a nation we are bound by those protections for those it applies to. Specificly those who are on this side of the birth canal. Having said that, as a nation it would be nice if we could come to some kind of compromise on the abortion issue. At the risk of sounding like the occupant of the White House, I think that rational thinking Americans could probably agree that at some point, ( as you state ), the fetus is a child. Since we refuse to define that point, being the " advanced " civilization that we are, we should be able to agree that somewhere within the second and third trimester that transisition occurs. And that abortions during the later terms of the pregnancy should only be allowed within the bounds of an emergency. HOWEVER, the extemes on both sides of the issue will never let that happen, and currently the pendulum is on the left.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8920_500_499_1_501_502_505_506_507_15<br><b>S1:1-  </b>He can't help it Steamroller, he's a troll.

Rom 1:24 Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them.

As for functioning brain, before then it feels nothing and can not think, nor ever has. Just sharing some similar DNA is not enough to make it count at this point.

In : Obstetrics : Normal and Problem Pregnancies, 2nd ed, Gabbe, SG, Niebyl, JR, Simpson, JL ( eds ), Churchill Livingstone, New York 1991. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>My understanding of the procedure is that the fetus sometimes has to be turned into a breeach position in order to have this procedure occur. As far as safety goes, I am thinking if a baby has been delivered except for the head, the hard part would be over and the mother's life would not really be in MORE jeopardy than when the procedure began. I guess I have a hard time thinking that this particular procedure actually can put the mother in LESS risk. It seems to be far more risky than actual delivery given the descriptions that I have read ( not on anti abortion websites but form surgical journals etc. ) Huck<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The facts, it seems, belie these suppositions. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>which suppositions ( I made a couple of them ) and which facts are you talking about?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The medical facts. You supposed the E & D procedure would not be safer, based upon, well I'm not sure. But anyway, the numbers don't bear that out. It is has the lowest mortality rate of 2nd trimester procedures. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Is the procedure different than the one I described?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3643_14_13__17_20_21_22_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>That's why I said worthy. Not legally punishable with. The idea that this man will spend years in prison for a totally illogical crime disgusts me, whether its legal or not. If I said that someone taken to a death camp had done nothing worthy of death would you say that they did because that was the law? Everyone's well aware of the legal position, so that obviously wasn't my meaning. if you want to argue that breaking the law is itself an immorality worthy of a life sentence, go ahead.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I can't see where it disgusts you, unless you feel that committing, or assisting in the perpetration, of a crime is logical / illogical... Even though rationality should play some role in our actions, it has no precedence here. What was done was against the law ; murder. Should he be alone in this? No. She should be there with him.... be they from Texas or Riptarse, Tennessee. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It disgusts me because this man has killed something which the law recongnises may be killed, and he even had the permission of the mother. The idea of spending years in the hell that is American jail because of whatever stupid reason they didn't have a proper abortion is agonising and ridiculous. But what she did wasn't as Fox News admits. You can't say he should be in jail BECAUSE its the law and then ignore the law so you can put her there too. If she's done something wrong, then I see no moral difference to every other abortion. Would you put every mother who has an abortion and every doctor involved in jail? This is an unjust law because it does not tally with others.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Even though I see where you're coming from - feelings play no part in it. I would like to run the conduit and wire in our football stadium. I could do it, have the means, but I have no license. It would be against the National Electric Code and I could be fined for even installing a receptacle in public housing or commercial buildings. It's the rules. It is pure and simple murder, just as some abortions ( not all ) are themselves, pure and simple murder. But, I can't allow my feelings to go against the law. I can, however, change the law to fit my feelings if I have the means. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I can allow my feelings to go against the law.

Human's don't get to decide the value of other human's. You get value from an authority above you. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Steeeve where are you getting this value angle from? People have a right to their lives regardless of the value of that life as determined by others. Don't they? So, if a child is alive,.... no matter what stage of life, growth or development they are in,... they have a right to the life they are living. Don't they? I don't get this " value " angle. We have established that human beings have a right to their lives. A prebirth child is a human being So, a prebirth child should have a right to their life. The life that they are already living. Simple as that.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I argue that value comes from something higher than what is being valued. So for example, I can't decide your value is less than mine, have that be universally true, and therefore make you my slave. We have a history in this country of thinking we can place values on ourselves and we try to arbitrarily create a definition based upon your own criteria you are giving to yourself. It actually creates a circular argument because you assume you have authority to give yourself value but you'd have to have value to do so and it makes a big circle. They have the same rights your or I do. The DOI said it best.. right are endowed by our creator. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Right,... so tell me at what point ( I conclude that it's conception ) is it that those rights are endowed in a new person's life? Then tell me how to prove that point to others in a forum that stresses a separation ( that i agree with ) between church and state.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It is largely irrelevant because if you take my argument that we aren't able to determine value of humans to begin with than abortion is already out of the question. And a right to life can be taken away from the person that granted it. Separation of church and state is a bogus argument in my opinion. It has gotten to the point where if a certain issue has a majority ( not 100% ) support by a religion than you can't make it a law. This is a perversion of what Jefferson said and frankly if you read the rest of his work he didn't mean it to be more than the state to stay out of the churches business. He never meant, and no one meant, that you can't have a moral code from a religion and based upon that vote for or against moral laws. Abortion laws and separation of church and state are unrelated. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Ok,... I've read that twice really slow. I got nuthin from it. I don't disagree with your conclusion. I do think that the arguments against elective abortion can and should be made without a religious basis when it is being presented to people who are not interested in a religious perspective,... or who are actually offended by it.

Intellectual dishonesty.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Perhaps not demonizing them, if castigating women who choose to abort as selfish or immoral is not demonizing. But, favoring fertilized eggs, embryos and fetuses over women certainly reduces greatly the humanity of the female sex. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>What you don't seem to understand is that we would have far more women in the world today if it weren't for abortion.

A vote which would take away this control violates reproductive and sexual freedom. This involves an operation done by a doctor. I don't see the reason it needs to be voted on, as it tells a woman what to do with her own body. How would men appreciate women voting on whether or not they could have vasectomies, use condoms, be prescribed anti-impotence drugs, or be circumcized? Who is best to make these personal decisions?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It is one thing to say that something does not need to be voted on, and it is another thing altogether to say that something cannot be voted on. I don't so much mind the former. It is the latter that I disagree with. But I also think it is somewhat silly to say that we need should not pass a law that tells a man / woman what to do with his / her body. There are already laws which do this. Laws against prostitution, bigamy, and public decency laws, for example. These all tell women, ( and, incidentally, men as well ) what to do with their own body. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That is taking democracy to a ridiculous extreme, in my opinion, if we were to vote on everything, including the most highly personal matters. However, they do not affect one's body as intimately as when it comes to operations such as abortion.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>And? I'm glad you view child rearing as the imposition of a lifetime of suffering. Many people don't agree with this opinion. There is still nothing special about abortion that makes it off limits to the masses in a democratic society. As I said earlier, you would be free to vote against any restrictions on abortion. But, your opinion is no more valid than any other person's opinion. If the majority of people want to restrict abortion, they ought to be able to do so. In a democratic society, the purpose of government is a matter of opinion, and as such, it should be decided upon by a vote. In a democratic society, majorities are not constrained by a single conception of the purpose of government ; the majority determines the purpose of government. This of course means that the purpose of government can ebb and flow. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And I think that is even a greater intrusion on the individual as it more intimately involves one's body. In fact, in Canada the Supreme Court found that restricting abortion was a violation of the woman's right to security of the person. Oh, it can be if one was pressured into it. Forcively having to remain in a state of pregnancy one does not want is also suffering. People may have an opinion, but it doesn't automatically give them the right to force others to live by that opinion. There are also laws and a Constitution which protect the individual from every popular whim or opinion that may impose upon individual liberties.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I don't know anything about Canada. But in the United States, the things which are considered intimate personal decisions free from regulation are decided by the majority. And the majority in the United States has not ever conferred such an exception to their right to legislate. No, one person does not have the right to force others to live by their opinion. But, the majority has that right in a democratic society. Perhaps they give some level of protection, but that protection is not absolute as laws and Constitutions can both be changed.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-4360_83_80__85_87_88_89_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Using the same logic, then, you're advocating the right to rape, the right to steal, the right to arson, the right to... etc. So what is the difference here?

In this day and age, we've lost the mere concept of duty, loyalty, responsibility, and obligation.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Try staying focused on abortion instead of going off on moralistic tangents ; the issue is civil liberty, a woman's right to abort a pregnancy. That is a woman's body and for you or a government to deny her the right to abort is infringing on her individual civil liberty, nothing else. I suggest you avoid using the word we in a patronizing manner when discussing abortion unless you can conceive, carry to term and give birth.

Stay focused, don't drift off into other subjects or moral issues. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I'm referring to the nation as a whole. That's easy, we need to regain those concepts and apply them into our lives. It's found nowhere in the US Constitution. And yes, it is a serious moral issue because we are talking about life. Not just lives of the unborn, but lives of the women who have been exploited by the abortion industry.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're evading the issue. This isn't an issue of a nation, including men, this is an individual right. Those women choose abortions and it is their right. You are not capable of conception so you use your belief system mythology to dominate their rights. Exploitation is denying them that right and forcing them to spawn children who are unwanted for what ever reason. You, as a male, are attempting to force your abortion moral standard on women. Why don't you just take away the rest of their hard-earned liberties? Voting, land ownership, divorce, freedom from servitude and on and on?

If a woman does not share the view of the pro-lifer then you say being forced to could kill her. The difference is the pro-lifer sees it as two people, the unborn and the woman.

Why is it that to you the religious belief of the anti abortionist is more important then the body of the woman? The fetus is a parasite on the woman, just as a tape worm is. Are you then saying that if the cult of the tape worm arises, then their religious belief should then be forced upon those who suffer from tape worms. Yes I know there is a difference between fetuses and tape worms but the principle is the same. Is someone elses religious belief more important then to be secure in your person and body?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>A fetus is not a parasite as a parasite has to of a different species. But even if you want to call a parasite it is still a human being and that overrides any belief of another. I reject the idea that a dispute implies we should have no laws on it. If this were true slavery should still be legal. Should your belief that slavery is wrong prevent those from getting slaves? If yes then why? You can tie it to abortion because you will end up saying something regarding a persons right to be free or whatever. Well, I believe in a right to life that overrides any a woman may have. Just as you may believe a right to do what you want with slavery doesn't override the persons right to be free. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>As I have said before. The fetus has the same rights as the woman if and only if it can crawl out of the womans body, stop its parasitic existance upon the body of another, and live on its own.

But there is aways away to protect yourself a 100%. If you are on birth control, your wearing a condom, and you pull out you will not get pregnant.

Even if you are on b.c., wearing a condom, and doing everything responsibly, you can still get pregnant. What if you took all these precautions and she still became pregnant? What would you want her to do? Your harsh words about women in unfortunate positions bother me. Shouldn't we do something to fix the problems rather than tell ' em tough XXXX?

There is no person inside of a fetus, just as there is no person inside of a fingernail. I would think it would be quite obvious.

I might add that science does not denote a human embryo as " a human body in development. " No, science says, " A zygote is the beginning of a new human being ( i.e., an embryo ).

We dropped more bombs on that little country than we had in all of WWII combined. Vietnamese support for us was falling rapidly, especially after incidents such as My Lai and the Tet Offensive. We bombed them, shot them, captured them, napalmed them, and did many other things to them.

It seems to me that you admit that the baby is important, no matter what. And that you then go on to say that it doesn't matter how important the baby is, if the parents want to, they can murder it.

A logical argument, please.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3315_223_222__224_225_226_227_244_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>A bacteria... im sorry, what would the fetus be classified under in science?? Oh right, a human... we got that whole " homo sapian sapian " deal going :). Not only that, didn't they have a baby born at 3 - 4 months? I can't remember that actually.. i will look it up. Either way, this arguement is done all the time and there are many things that refute it... so not need to get into it.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>He was refering to a fetus ' parasitical nature, not it's classification ( per se ). <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Granted, however, I wouldn't want my mom calling me a parasite... although I can't really speak for everyone<br><b> S2:2-  </b>A born child, such as yourself ( I'm assuming ), does not have the same parasitical nature that a fetus does. Your mother feeding and caring for you is voluntary ( since she could have given you up ). <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Having sex is voluntary too..... And old people are parasitical on the state ( with social security and medicare )... we should kill them :)<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Being pregnant is not. We should have the right if they lived off of our bodies as a fetus does against our will and without our consent. That is a red herring. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Actually being pregnant is a direct result from having sex. For example, if you enlist in the army and end up getting killed you can't say " i never signed up for getting killed "... well, ya did, you knew what you were getting into when you did it.... as to the second part.... you did consent as stated.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-5365_64_63__65_66_67_68_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The hand reached out and grabed the doctors finger... You mean to tell me thats not a person? From that website : " By 15 weeks, ultrasound reveals babies moving in reaction to something as simple as a mother's laugh or cough ".<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Its likely reflexs if the brain isn't showing activity in the right places as well, especially when you consider the what the fetus will be responding to in the case of laughs or coughs - its not hearing the sound but being compressed by the movement of the diaphram. A lot of movement ( probably the majority of it if we take into account moving to balance weight and smooth muscle stuff as well ) requires no concious control from the brain at all, and in many cases you won't even be aware its happening. Don't forget that on top of this there are a lot of instincts babies have as soon as they are born that then are replaced shortly after, grabbing things is one of them. Though I don't know quite what the level of brain involvement is when it comes to instincts. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Is this based on you guessing or do you have any backing for what you said here?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Not quite a just guess, but what I would assume was the case if the brain wasn't showing any ( let alone higher ) activity in the brain. Its the case with with more traditional reflexs like recoiling after touching something sharp or hot, or when your leg moves when the knee is tapped ( which is one the balancing ones I mentioned ). On top of that there are the frog leg and lizard tail examples. The laughing and coughing on is almost certainly going to be a reflex ( you don't conciously move when you are poked or prodded unexpectedly, the signal doesn't even go up to the brain until after the movement is complete in these sort of cases in adults ), the grasping one I'm less sure about as I don't know entirely where instinct works within the brain. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>ok? I am not sure what your point is with all of this...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It was in response to you saying that brain activity occurs early on the pregnancy, whilst there may be some neural activity and even brain activity - it doesn't require there to be a mind, or even for the body to be alive in some cases.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-5365_146_142__148_151_152_153_154_155_156_157_158_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>not if the other will die.... even so, that is wrong.

( The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America in Congress July 4, 1776 ) If that is the basis of our rights, then we don    t we need to acknowledge that this same Creator endowed the province of carrying of the fertilized ovum to the female of our species? Don    t we need to trust that decision? Doesn    t taking the position that a government can take that divine endowment of the Creator away from the female of our species is to undermine the very source of our rights.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>1. So... how does abortion ( the taking of a human life ) fit into this perceived nurturing responsibility of the mother? 2. Also, are you against the government keeping a mother from killing her toddler? 3. There is no difference between a mother going against nature by neglecting her innate nuturing responsibility through abortion and a mother killing her toddler except the size and location of the child. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>1. The terminating or carrying to term of a pregnancy should not be ( in my view ) a province of the government. I do not think we should let the government believe that they have the power to force a woman to carry a pregnancy to term or force her to terminate it. I do not think it wise to give the government that power. That is where abortion fits in. 2. Once born a human ( toddler, infant, or elderly ) have the same rights as outlined in the Declaration of Independence. 3. There is a valid point of view that wants the fertilized ovum declared a person. That seems to be what you are saying. Is that your point of view?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>What about doing this in america to an illegal alien? You are inconsistent. You say that a government should not be able to limit the killing of a human life ( abortion ). You say that a government should be able to limit the killing of a human life ( mother killing baby who has been out of the womb for a nanosecond ). Both involve the mother's health. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Illegal aliens are covered by the constitution. It is not limited to citizens, the constitution covers all persons. As far as points 2 and 3, you are correct. I believe that until the fetus is born the Creator has given the responsibility for it solely to the mother. Once a fetus is born it becomes the responsibility of the family and society. You seem to disagree. I asked a simple question which you did not answer. Do you believe that the fertilized ovum should be treated like a person, with all the rights that come with that? I'd appreciate a direct answer.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>If this is true, then it should cover the fetus since there is no difference between the fetus and the infant besides size and location.

I must ask you again, in which species? Now, suppose you rip a fetus out of the womb so that it can be held in the arms. Think about it. Think really, really hard! In what species is that possible? What happens if you did that with the human species?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Nope never said that. This is a difference. The only other difference is the size / development. Isnt it interesting that you can have a mother carrying a less developed born baby in her arms in one room, and a mother carrying a more developed human in her womb and having an abortion in the next room. Using discrimination against someone's size and development as a basis for killing them is bigotry rooted in a prejucial dogma of selfish extremism. It happens and it is called birth.

Majorities hold certain powers but they are limited. Minorities continue to have rights which may not be infringed by the majority.

It does not do so.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>the constitution doesn't always overrule a majority and still, the whole system is based on the idea of a majority... and in some cases the " super majority ". But you are. You can't just claim someone is not a person and therefore say you are not imposing beliefs on them. If this were the case then I'd just say you aren't a person and therefore when I hurt you it wouldn't be wrong. Would you agree with this statement? I neither tell you that you must have a slave or that you must refrain from having one. In what way does that impose any belief of mine upon you?

You are not logical in attempting to obsecure the primary issue.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>They weren't considered persons then. This was the so called " convention " that you think is important. So I ask again, given the fact slaves were not considered persons at the time would you agree with the below statement : I neither tell you that you must have a slave or that you must refrain from having one.

Suppose also that Alice and Bob are fortunate enough to get what they want ( because everyone is entitled to have everything they want, right? ) Suppose further that five years down the road, their perfectly healthy child develops a chronic illness for which much resources will be required to address. Are Alice and Bob justified in killing their child? They did not want an ill child, but that is what they now have. Why should Alice and Bob not be permitted to kill this chronically ill child? For the pro-life community, the issue comes down to the fact that every human being has intrinsic value and worth, and their life is valuable for its own sake, and not for any benefit they might bring to their parents, their society, or any other person.

Slaves are not even close to being in the same circumstances that a fetus is to a woman. If slaves were in that situation, then I would completely be against the gov    t giving them the rights you are suggesting the fetus have. The desire is not to    do what one wants with his / her body   . Do you practice being obtuse? The desire is to prevent others from using ( or allowing the use of ) ones body against his / her will. In your    analogy    ( and I use the term loosely ), the desired right is more closely aligned with the teacher.

The point was to show the inconsistent belief that if a person believes life begins at conception yet they believe in pro-choice then they are in fact inconsistent.

If you believe that life begins at conception then if you also believe in the right to choose you are inconsistent. I then compared this to slavery in a way by saying... I am personally against abortion but I support a womens right to choose whether or not she wants the baby. and I am personally against slavery but I support a slaveholders right to choose whether or not he / she wants a slave. The comparison in view points remains valid. The same reasoning goes in for both of them... That is, you believe in your own views but not forcing them on others.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Inconsistent in what way? I do not see it as inconsistent. This is not an inconsistent statement. Believing others should have the right to do something you may personally disagree with is not an inconsistent position. It would only be inconsistent if you personally disagreed with something and did it yourself. No, comparing someone's view on abortion with their view on slavery is shameless play at comparing abortion and slavery. The point is just as easily made if taken by itself. If you wish. However, neither are inconsistent postions.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3000_219_217__224_226_227_228_229_231_232_236_237_238_254_266_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Not according to an absolute moral standard that places the highest value on human life. The only reason I keep replying is because I want people to understand just where the relativist postion leads. Under moral relativism, we can't say that child molestation, genocie, racism, slavery, or anything is intrisically wrong ( you have said as much ). Therefore, under moral relativism there really is no reason to make laws against such things. Yet even further, there really is no reason to follow such laws should they exist. Moral relativism, if followed out to its logical conclusion, leads to anarchy and disorder where no action is justly punishable and justice has no meaning. Also, what does IMO mean? I've seen it a few times, but I must confess that I am illiterate when it comes to forum abbreviations.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>How can there be one moral standard which applies to all people given we know of societies that have moral standards different than our own? Example : In the past it was customary in some Polynesian cultures for women to bear children prior to taking a husband to demonstrate to all prospective husbands that they could indeed bear children. No negative social stigma. There are many such examples. IMO = In My Opinion. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Just because there exists a diversity of opinion surrounding morality, it in no way follows that an absolute moral standard does not exist.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So according to you someone acting morally within their culture could be in fact immoral according to your idea of " absolute " morality. Then what? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The possibility certainly arises. Hitler comes to mind. Then we have a standard by which we can deem actions right or wrong, we can have a basis for making laws, we can have a basis for actually following laws, and we can have a basis for punishing lawbreakers.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>How does this apply to a person in that other culture? Should all acts deemed immoral also be illegal? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>That other culture is accountable to the same absolute moral standard, and as such so are the people within that culture. Sure why not. But there are obviously degrees of immorality and thus there should be degrees of illegality.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Where are these " degrees " of absolute moral standards set forth? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Look to the Creator of the moral universe, that Supreme Judge of all the world.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Would you be referring to written word or direct communication? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>How about a written record of a direct communication?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>So then can I assume that you feel all " law " for all people should be in conformance with the " morality " set forth this written word? I will not take issue with the authenticity of the writings themselves for now. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>Yes. Apparently I need more words to post my answer....<br><b> S2:7-  </b>Would rejection of the authority of this written word be an act of immorality itself and therefore an illegal act the society you envision?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-687_4_3__7_10_11_12_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Isn't a dead person also still human?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I'll be able to answer that if you can clarify the diffrence between a human and a person. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Dead mind. As long as a fetus is human without a mind wouldn't a dead person without a mind also be human?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>To equate a fetus with the unability to think to a dead body is, well, wrong. A dead person, that is void of soul-spirit would be a dead body. The fetus will, under natural conditions will have the ability to think. A dead body cannot think. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I didn't realize that you could determine whether a soul-spirit would be in a dead, living, or unborn body. How can you tell if it is in there or not? At what point do you consider it a fetus? The moment the sperm enters the egg? A week after? A month after? In the early stages the fetus will not have the ability to think just as a dead body doesn't. In the late stages it will have the ability and I think this is what you are debating here.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>For your first question, please bear with me... very new at debating and clarifying myself. You asked a good question and you desrve a good answer. I'll need to chew on that and get back to you. For your second question, and I'm not familiar in sciences or biology, the fetus is a later stage of devolopment, from sperm + egg, then zygote, then fetus. Stages of devepment Now, you said " in the later stages it will have the ability to think... " How did you come to that conclusion? Why the later stages of development ( fetus )? Would it not be that a zygote STILL has the chances of the ability to think as it develops into a fetus, then a infant?

Direct killing of someone is probably a good place to start. Eventhough we are all selfish, it is a good idea to try and limit it to a reasonable level.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So why don't we do the same thing with ants and other insects? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>why don't you answer your own question. Why don't you kill a human the same way you would kill an ant? ( as in without a second thought )<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well I don't kill ants without a second thought. If there is one in the house, I toss it outside alive, but many people do just crush them without a second thought. Another answer is that I would be punished severely by the government if I murdered a human. ( again the only reason a human having a right to life being a government threat ) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>so, you would ok if murder laws were taken away and people could freely kill each other? You would not feel violated in any way? Moreover, slaves had no rights because the government didn't recoginse them?... So why did we all of a sudden feel they had a right to rights when they had no rights at all?? Very confusing.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>no. Wrong. Right. we decided to give them rights. Not really. I'll expound a little. I would not be ok if murder laws were taken away because I feel that the right to life is important. I would feel violated but actually probably not, I would just feel dead. You are correct, slaves had no rights which is why they were treated so poorly with no consequences, they were fighting for civil RIGHTS. They didn't have the rights and were fighting for them. They wanted the same rights as everyone else, fought for them, and won them. Now the government will arrest you if you murder a black or white, or if you enslave someone.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3738_58_57__59_60_62_64_65_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>So you would save the mouse over the baby for religious reasons?

Even so, your dog isn't worth the collar it wears when compared to the intrinsic priceless worth of another human being. Are you opposed to war? But what about Are you opposed to the death penalty? But what about this...<br><b> S2:1-  </b>How is that any different then saving two of each species over a single human? Even if that does happen, it can be reversed. Good luck doing that with a human. Poor argument. gnojek is adding to total GDP production. Is a newborn doing that? LOL. I don't know what is more amusing, the fact that you couldn't prove that if your life depended on it, or that you actually said it. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not sure why you felt the urge to comment here. Do you think that gnojek's reason for saving the mouse over the baby is correct? You are obviously thinking of some minor little bite on the hand. I'm thinking of the kind of bite that rips someone's hand off, causes them to get gangrene, which ultimately causes them to die ; something that cannot be reversed. A Human, on the other hand, would be less likely to engage in biting the hand that saved it because of the various consequences that would result ( law, jail, restitution, etc. ) So what?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, that's just his opinion. You obviously would do the opposite. As such because there is no standard of action, the value of life, ranging across species is by no way equal. That is not up for debate. I made the comment in regards to your's. Besides, it was too fitting. LOL. Sure, if the person is in the middle of nowhere with no means of communication. ;) You are getting funnier by the moment. Yet we have 2 million people in jail in the US alone with at least 10 + million in China. Reasses your argument. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Tell me Duo, is it always the case that in order to decrease the surplus population, we should look at who contributes to the total GDP production, find those people who don't contribute, and eliminate them?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Tell me Cone, why is it that as arguments go on and on, you have a tendency to ignore the majority of posts and try to use the fallacy of selective reading to fool people into thinking you are correct?

How weak is your argument that you resort to comparing abortion to eating meat? That is very poor indeed. Where did I mention religion? Abortion causes great suffering for the mother in terms of guilt and regret, not to mention the damage it causes society.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Do not assume this, as it is not always a given. What damage does it cause society? I'm drawing a blank. Thanks. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I have never assumed this is " always a given ".

Don    t you think killing innocent people harms society? [ / QUOTE ] No, I really don't. I would like to see some statistical information about how this is. Enlighten me. If I can see concrete evidence rather than " it effects morale " ( how? ) and " we're not churning out enough little worker bees " ( should women become mandated baby factories to support the population? ) then I'll be happy to change my mind that killing feti harms society. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Incorrect, I have never said it was, " always a given   . But surely it is more important to remember those that do fall into this category. If killing innocent people doesn    t harm society, why is it illegal to kill innocent people?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No, it's not more important. It's very important to help these women, of course, but don't forget about the ones who don't feel regret. Of course, this is no perk to the anti-choice crowd. Impossible that a woman would have an abortion and not feel guilt! She must be some soulless heathen incapable of having any real feelings. We must tell her what she should feel! ( Not directed at you ; just a societal thought ) But would you ban abortion because some women feel guilty? It's apparently, by your own definition, not. Since ( I believe ) you define abortion as killing innocent people, and abortion is legal, it's not. So how is killing innocent unborn persons harmful to society? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So you think it is not more important to remember those that receive great suffering in terms of guilt and regret, as oppose to those that have no regrets? No, I would ban abortion because it is genocide. Correct, so if killing innocent people doesn    t harm society, why is it illegal to kill innocent people? Well, consider what would happen if every pregnancy ended that way?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-5252_57_56__58_59_60_61_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>There arn't really terms for these things, and the terms we have have thousands of definitions - I'm talking about people in the way you would encounter in everyday life rather than things that are technically people but nothing like someone you would meet on the street. I've no problem really with feti and embryo being referred to along with human ( unless you are implying therefore that the human definition is something special ) but I'll tend to use person to refer to a child / adult human ( rather than adult human as it implies you are leaving babies and children out ).<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You can encounter the unborn in everyday life too, through ultra sound, 3D scans, listening to their heartbeat through a stethoscope, etc, etc.. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Thats not everyday life, thats looking at feti. For the sake of the argument - we are talking about concious and developed humans. I find it a lot easier to say people and just assume you know what I am trying to say, the fact that we are nitpicking each other's points here shows the whole problem with the nomenclature. Can we agree to this system for the time being, just to argue the points at least? Human = Anything that is, or will develop into a Human Being / Homo Sapian Person = Someone who has been born, regardless of age Fetus = Anything that is, or will develop into a Human Being / Homo Sapian but has not yet been born ( not strictly accurate, but it can do for now )<br><b> S2:2-  </b>How about we just accept facts as they are? A human is a human. A person is someone born if you accept conception as the birth of a person. Foetus is an unborn human / Person. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>By definition, clearly. I don't though, but hey lets go with this for now. So then, to the original point, you apparently condemn killing, however.... Yet would you also condem the killing of a serial killer? Or of a soldier on peace keeping duties trying to defend civilians from an attack by opposed militia? Do you really think its the same as genocide, or are embryos and fetus important enough not to be allowed to be aborted but not as important as a born person, possibly with dependents of their own?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I condemn all killings.

One more time, and please read for comprehension this time. My position was, is, and always will be that it is the proper role of each and every pregnant woman to decide what value she gives to her fetus. If any particular woman believes that her fetus is a separate entity and she chooses to protect it with all the resources at her command, I support that. If another pregnant woman chooses to think of her fetus as disposable and acts on that belief, I support that as well. That's the true essence of the pro-choice position - the empowerment of women and the recognition that each and every pregnant woman is capable of making competent choices.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>One mans opinion.. good for him. Others have a different opinion... good for them. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Which is, of course the essence of the pro-choice position. :) Neither of us have the right to impose our opinions on others.

All this time we thought that you would demand that we bear any burden, pay any price to bring an end to such depravity. Instead, you choose to hide behind your usual Jesuitical word games when you are cornered. Guess you were just funnin ' us all this time. Except that we are not laughing.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I'm not soft on crime. We should do what we reasonably can do. No one has successfully ended all murder of born people. Doesn't mean we don't have laws against it. To not realize, and admit, that there is a very real logical and philosophical problem in a claim to truth, when the claimant does not believe truth exists, is to simply belie one's sophistry. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Could have fooled us, what with your not even making an effort to determine whether a " crime " has been or is about to be committed. You're not even trying in this case. For Shame, Madam " Not Soft on Crime. " Yada, yada yada.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>When was the last time the police investigated you for murder? Oh, hasn't happened in a while? The police must be soft on crime, seeing how they haven't bothered to even " make an effort to determine whether a crime has been or is about to be committed. " You will see that all I have been arguing is that, should a law be passed, it be applied with the same rigor as similar laws. Go ahead and sing. No matter how loud the chorus, or annoying the song, you cannot change the fact that your arguments amount to one giant logical contradiction.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7918_884_879_1_886_904_908_958_15<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Only if one holds your opinion :)<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The disturbing part of the pro-life argument is that it deems one opinion better than the other, then forces that opinion on those who don't share it. Its quite a slippery slope that's seen in almost all totalitarian governments. We should obviously legislate what we need to make society function and protect human beings from harm, but pointing to a sack of skin, calling it a human, and forcing a woman to squeeze it through her vagina is where the real immorality lies. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Once again, this your opinion. You are entitled to your opinion whatever it may be. What you are not entitled to do is feel that your opinion is so ' right ' that others cannot have a different opinion. I may trash your opinion, you may hate my opinion. So what! It is up to each of us to defend our positions and if we cannot maybe learn from others. for instance, you believe that a fetus is a sack of skin and the act of giving birth is squeezing this sack of skin through a vagina. ( the sack of skin then becomes a baby apparently ). This is your opinion. Oxymoron or not I prefer not to describe an unborn baby as a sack of skin and I feel that the fetus should be given some protection towards the end of the pregnancy. That is my opinion. The only opinion that should not be tolerated is that we should not have an opinion.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I am in completely agree, and the law should remain this way. You should be free to practice your opinion, and I should be free to practice mine. Don't like abortions? Don't have one. Simple as that. The law should respect both opinions, which is what I propose. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If a fetus is, as you believe, just a bag of skin then it would be absurd to curb an abortion. However if one believes that the fetus is a human in it's own right then an abortion would infantcide.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I don't see where you're going with this.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7918_73_68__75_76_77_78_6<br><b>S1:1-  </b>If not, then on what grounds would you prohibit abortion late in a woman's pregnancy? What justification do you have for this? Is it or is it not " the killing of a child "? If it is, then it's murder ; if it isn't, you have no basis for banning it.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>We have produced solid medical evidence in other current debates that fetuses feel pain and even dream when sleeping, in the second trimester. I guess that means nothing to you huh? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>OK, let's assume you are correct. You are in favor of a law outlawing abortion, right? What sanction should the law demand for those who either have an abortion or perform one?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That's a whole other question and debate. The issue here is, if it is true that the question exists that they feel pain, and dream while in the womb, then shouldn't they be given the benefit of the doubt and we ere on the side of caution regarding how late in the pregnancy abortions are allowed to be performed? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>OK. So your objection is not to abortion per se, but only to the time at which it is performed. Welcome to the Pro-choice side of the issue.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're an ignorant XXXXX cap 0, and it's a waste of time discussing anything at all with you. Rather than respond to the simplest question, you prefer to put words in my mouth.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7918_574_560__577_579_581_588_592_615_617_630_4<br><b>S1:1-  </b>is it so hard for women to keep their legs crossed? the only women's leg openers I know apart from rape, are lust and / or money. :p<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Not at all fond of women, are you? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>On the contrary, I am prefer women to men. I find ( in general ) women more intelligent than men and less aggressive. I don't find my comment misogynist at all. What did I say that it isn    t true? I was reading in a magazine 8 reasons why women cheat on men and how they are better at hiding it than men. Men not only are not as good as women at hiding their infidelities but they only have one reason. No prize for guessing the correct answer. :)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I can only conclude that all sex is to you is getting away with infidelity. Rather a shallow take on the topic. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>not at all. I was just referring to what I read in a women's magazine that my wife left around. Don't tell me that some women don't cheat? I have nothing as I said against women. My daughter has a Master in Medical Science and soon she will begin studying for a Master in nursing. We go to art galleries together and she is much smarter than I. Would I say this if I hated women?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Why the devil do you keep harping on about women who cheat then? You seem obsessed with the idea of women being unfaithful. Why? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Do I? a touchy subject for you, Antonia and mae, among others? Don't tell me that some women don't cheat? I was just referring to what I read in a women's magazine that my wife left around ( written you would say by a woman obsesses with women cheating, and read by women obsessed with women cheating ) I also read in a New Scientist magazine that scientists have found that men suspect women of cheating even when there is no reason for it and also that women are better at hiding it than men. According to the scientists this behaviour is a product of evolution for males don    t want to care and raise children that are not their own. Why the female of the species cheat? The New Scientist didn    t say, so for that you need that women magazine and you being women know it better than I. So why women cheat, Simone, Antonia?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Why do men cheat? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I asked first : why do women cheat?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>But I certainly am not obsessed with cheating men. I don't constantly refer to cheating men. You, sirrah, are obsessed and you ought to do something about it. You could begin by considering the real fact that men cheat. So, why do men cheat?</p></body> </html>
