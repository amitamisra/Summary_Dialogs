<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Yes, it is human sperm, but it is not biologically human. Obviously basic biology and reproductive facts are not your strong point.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Nor are they <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I am not a scientist. I am a philosopher. That said, I do study the concepts of science and whatever facts I need to understand the issue. Which is less I can say for you.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You made a statement that was wrong and accused another of ignorance when the ignorance was yours. You are no more a philosopher than anyone else who makes incorrect statements and then tries to hide it by accusing others of A philosopher?.. Diogenes without wit, intelligence and <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I made no wrong statement. You just dont know anything about biology. The ignorance is yours.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So it is not wrong because you say its.. how pathetic.. defend the statement or concede you were wrong.. superman<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Why don't you atheists quit pussyfooting around. Just ask the " dumb " christians this one and be done with it. If God can do anything, can he create a rock so big that He can not lift it? There..., YOU WIN!! Debate concluded.., no need to go on. As for my Christian brothers and sisters...., " Pearls before SWINE... " These people have absolutely no interest in knowing God or finding truthful answers to the preposterous questions they pose. Not one of them has ever truly sought God, though they know enough to fear the hell that may await them. From what little knowledge they possess comes the wellspring of hatred for the God they refuse to acknowledge and continue to deny through vein attempts by winning word games in the battlefields of thier own minds. There comes a time to shake the dust from your feet and move to a field whose harvest awaits you.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>True. That's why Jesus gave up on the prostitutes and tax collectors. Er, waitaminnit.... I'll leave it to " these people " to decide what they are or aren't interested in finding. But speaking as a Christian, I think their questions are entirely legitimate, and one can learn a lot by taking their questions seriously instead of dismissing them as uninterested in the truth. How do you know that? Indeed, how do you know that some haven't truly found him? Have you considered the possibility that maybe you are the one who isn't looking very hard? or that maybe, whatever you may think you've found, you are mistaken? I confess that I'm not sure " they " are the ones who fear that hell may awaith them.... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Matthew 10:13 - 15 ( New International Version ) 13 If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it ; if it is not, let your peace return to you. 14 If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town. 15 I tell you the truth, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town. You are very eloquent in your use of words and arguementation so it is not in my best interest to get into a jousting match with you. However, if you can not see the spirit behind these " questions " then perhaps you should look into your own vanity that motivates you to show everyone how smart you are?? Again I refer you to the spirit behind the " questions " Perhaps you should look into that...,<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Fair enough. If you feel debate is pointless, don't bother. Why not? You'll either come up with more rigorous ways of thinking about what you already believe, or you'll change your mind. Either way, you will be improved by the debate. - sigh - I have no doubt that some posters here have an antipathy toward religion. But of course, I think that is largely because so many religious people in this country refuse to take their questions seriously. Such religious believers attack the motives of the questioners ( and of anyone who takes their questions seriously, of course -- as here ). It is my contention that this thoroughly ad hominem tactic provokes the antipathy. If you choose to dismiss rather than to engage, and if you ( erroneously ) suggest that you're really not cut out for engagement, yet you nonetheless request that others acquiesce to your beliefs in the public arena -- well, I'm sorry but that is bound to get a strong reaction. And it's the sort of thing that has been happening in this country for decades. Instead of saying that you can't hack it with " words and argumentation, " why not give it a go? What are you afraid of? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>This was your response to my comment about casting pearls before swine... This is my comment about prostitutes and tax collectors... And then your response... Debate is not pointless when there is an audience to convince, regardless of the topic. The audience may be a judge, an onlooker, or one of the participants. If you have a " red letter " Bible, you will find the scripture above writte in red. In other words Jesus Himself instructed His disciples, ( who would later become apostles ), not to waste their time in pointless debate. Then He punctuated His statment with a curse. As I stated earlier about your use of words and your ability to argue, I don't have the time nor the patience the play word games or play with symatics. I never said Jesus " gave up " on anybody, nor was my comment concerning pearls, advising anyone to give up on a " seeker ". The comment WAS, however, directed at those who continually bash Christians whether the topic is abortion, homosexuality, or Sarah Palin. There comes a time to just walk away.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Right. According to the author of Matthew, who was not an eyewitness to the life of Jesus, who wrote these words approximately fift years after Jesus ' death, and who seems to have had liturgical purposes in mind as the Christian movement began to break away from Judaism and sought non-Jewish ways of understanding and expressing traditional Jewish ideas. Who's playing word games or semantics? Not me. To the contrary, I'd say that so-called " conservative Christianity " has been playing games with the Bible for over a hundred years now. Criticizing conservative Christianity is not equivalent to " bashing Christians. " As a practicing Christian myself, I assure you that this is last thing I want. Meanwhile, since when is Sarah Palin a " Christian " issue?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No, you have it all wrong, but it doesn't surprise me because I used to think that way. Consider this analogy. Fire is useful and in many ways beneficial. But misused, it can ( and usually is ) deadly. Same with the sexual relationship. Kept within the confines of marriage, it brings an incredible source of pleasure, fulfillment, and blessing. But when it is misused in ways as you suggest, then there is nothing but pain and emptiness. You don't always have to have sex in a romantic relationship.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>But why not have sex in a romantic relationship? It's an incredible source of pleasure, contraception, and if necessary plan-b, removes the possibility of pregnancy and selective choice virtually eliminates the possibility of social disease transmition. Bassman, you wouldn't be attempting to force your evangelical belief system into the thread by telling consenting adults sex without marriage is all wrong, would you? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Because it is not an essential part of said relationship. As I've stated What?? Oh, you mean conception And encourages more promiscuity. Plan B is not an end-all-be-all. With a 90% effectiveness, this is still unacceptable. The only 100% effective means is abstinence before marriage. First off, as an Evangelical, I'm offended by that remark. Second, up until the " sexual revolution " of the ' 60 s and 70's even most unbelievers exercised more common sense when it came to the sexual relationship.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I don't know why you'd be offended. Does your belief system not condemn sex without marriage under any circumstance? The so-called sexual revolution you refer to was over 40 - years ago. It assisted in removing a social stigma of sex without marriage, something that existed long before Christianity. If you're going to base your opinions on the dogma of your belief system, why not exclude terms like common sense and relationships without marriage? They have no real meaning when your bottom line opinion is no marriage, no sex. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>One, just because I base my life on the Bible doesn't mean I throw common sense out the window. In fact, scripture is replete with sound advice concerning life issues, including sex. Two, what " greatness " has resulted in the " sexual revolution "?? Nothing but devestation. STDs, illegitimacy, broken lives, abortion. That is the legacy of the " sexual revolution ".<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Common sense is defined as good judgment not based on specialized knowledge, which would certainly exclude following antiquated personal oracles such as belief system dogma. While your bible may provide you and your sect with a sense of personal security based on faith, it has little meaning once you step into the real world. I'm not condemning your beliefs, merely pointing out that they're not applicable to everyone. I would find it rather difficult to even imagine blaming US societal problems in general on sex outside of marriage.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Well, did making incest illegal result in women's lifes being put in jeopardy? Because making abortion illegal sure will!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>A woman's life is also put in jeopardy when they have a Legal abortion. Just LESS jeopardy. On the original question of when does a human become a person? I don't know if anyone answered this one yet. But it's simply when a cell gains the natural ability to form into a NEW organism. That's pretty much it. Totipotency. Sperm doesn't have that ability, neither do ova, nor do skin cells, or liver cells, or anything else in our body. They are all specific cells designed to do a function. Only one cell in a human ever has the ability to become another human " person ". And that is a fertilized egg. S o.. that's when you became a person. The moment you became. Using the logic of " a person isn't a person until they are fully formed " is ridiculous. By that logic, we could kill every child who hasn't hit puberty. Because they aren't fully formed yet. Any questions? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Abortion is a medical procedure. All medical procedures carry risk, that is why it is so important that they be carried out by medically trained professionals rather than quacks and butchers. So if you follow your logic all medical procedures should be outlawed because a person's life will be put in jeopardy. If you needed a medical procedure, how would you feel if the only option you have is to go to quacks and butchers?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>First of all, I never stated that any medical procedures should be outlawed. You jumped to conclusions. Secondly, Why are you throwing around the word NEED like that? In the very few cases ( 2.8% ) where the mother's life may be in jeopardy from the pregnancy, she will NEED an operation. All other elective abortions are a WANT. So a woman would NEVER have to go to a quack or butcher for an operation that she NEEDED, if it was illegal for all other elective abortions. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>When women are in a desperate situation, it becomes a need. Not everybody is fortunate enough to have family and friends for support.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Nope. Nothing doing. When talking life and death of a fetus, the need to perform the abortion should be a reason of life or death of the mother all other " needs " pale in comparison and, in my book, are just " wants ". And you are wrong about women not haveing family or friends for support. Every woman in the world can find a family and friend who will help with adoption.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Might I suggest a little reading up on Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood. She promoted eugenics as a means of keeping the poor ( read blacks, Jews and other undesirables ) population down. http://www.lifeadvocate.org/1_98/feature.htm http://blackgenocide.org/sanger.html http://blackgenocide.org/negro.html http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/dickie-sanger.html<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Margaret Sanger does not speak for pro-choicers. Infact opinion polls in the US show that 68% - 70% want to keep Roe vs. Wade. Why is to soooo hard for you to accept that the reason pro-choicers want to keep abortion legal is only out of concern about the nasty consequences of making illegal. It has nothing to do with bigotry. One can say that it is you who is a bigot because it is YOU that has no concern for women's lifes if they are forced to go to quacks and butchers if abortion is made illegal. Where is your concern for women's lifes? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Margaret Sanger was one of the creators of pro-choice advocacy groups. Isn't it ironic that pro-choice advocates now try to distance themselves from their creator.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I know nothing about Margaret Sanger and I am not a member of any pro-choice advocacy group.... so your logic is insane to put it mildly. As I said 68% of the people want to keep abortion legal in the US.... are you saying that two thirds of the people in the US are bigots and murderers? Come on.... think carefully before you go aroung throwing accusations wildly. And I find your attitude towards women lifes callous and insenstive to say the least if abortion were made illegal. You don't seem to even show 1% of the concern for women that you show for yes.... a clump of cells. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Maybe you should look at more specifically targeted questions. http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm Only 25% favored unrestricted abortions. When asked if they supported late-term abortions, the results were 2 : 1 against. You don't know jack about my concern for women and women's lives. All you know is that I think that abortion is immoral. How you can determine that I have a callous attitude towards women from that little piece of information is beyond me. Or do you just make such statements thinking that it will further your position by weakening my character? Well, I've been down that road before. Bring on some facts and we can debate instead of hurl invectives at each other.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Here we go again - that 68% ( from CNN ) figure was for not overturning Roe Vs. Wade. If you don't like it too bad. I bet the CNN figure is more likely to be accurate than what you have quoted. The fact is two thirds of the US public does not want to go back to the days of back alley abortions and quacks and butchers performing abortions... Is that so hard for you to accept? I will say this again - you want to make abortion illegal, which means you don't give a damn about women who will be forced to go to quacks and butchers if that happens. Don't you get it? we don't live in a perfect world.... so you think abortion is immoral... guess what many pro-choicers might think that too but they also recognise reality and know that making abortion illegal will result in women's lifes being put in jeopardy if abortion goes underground. So you have no concern for women if you don't take that into consideration. You live in a world of absolutes, but life is more complicated than that.... <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I'm all in favor of abortions if the woman's life is in danger and she choses an abortion. But the fact is that most abortions are gotten out of convenience and not real need. I've posted the stats a number of times, so you can see for yourself that all but a few % are for self-serving, selfish reasons.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>So what can we do about that? We cannot legislate morality. I do agree with you that sometimes pro-choicers overlook this fact that there is far too many abortions done out of convenience than real need. Yes it is a sad fact but what can anybody do about it... we just have to chose the lesser of two evils. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>We don't have to accept the lesser of two evils. And we legislate morality every day, what's new about that? Public nudity, pornography, prostitution, drugs, the list is endless.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>The difference between these examples you have cited and abortion is that a woman's life will be put in jeopardy if abortion is made illegal. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>As I said, I have no problem with allowing abortions when the mother's life is in jepoardy. If you're talking about backwoods illegal abortions, then that's their choice.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Backwoods abortions is nobody's choice. When abortion was illegal in the US, backwoods abortions did take place because women had no choice but to go to quacks and butchers. We don't live in a perfect world, women will abort no matter whether abortion is legal or illegal. So the question is whether to keep it safe and legal or illegal and unsafe. And you sir, are in no position to sit on judgement on women who abort because you will not be the one responsible for the child's welfare if born..... So unless you are willing to take responsiblilty for all the children that are born unwanted because you will only permit abortion when the mother's life is at stake, I suggest you keep your morals to yourself. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>I'd be more than happy to take responsibility for EVERY baby that I sire. In fact, I have three. You want to remove the element of accountability because you don't like it. Too bad! And you want it to remain legal because it will occur anyways? What kind of twisted logic is that? Should we make incest legal? After all, it's going to occur anyways.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>Well, did making incest illegal result in women's lifes being put in jeopardy? Because making abortion illegal sure will!<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No! At conception we are a person and human. All living things belong to a species and the foetus is a living thing, for that reason a foetus must belong to a species, and that species is human. A fingernail is dead so cannot be considered a living human, nor will it develop into a human. The sperm only has half the chromosomes so is not human. The unique human is the key element here, if you cut your nail, the DNA from the nail can be replicated by the living persons nail, a foetus when destroyed cannot have itself replicated, the unique DNA that is destroyed will never be see on earth again, that individual has gone forever, howver, the man with the nail clipped is still alive.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>How do you know we are a person at conception? What is the source of your conviction? What guides your reason and can anyone come to your viewpoint without faith in some divine authority? My common sense suggests that a mass of human tissue that has yet to develop sentience cannot be fairly defined as a " person ". <br><b>S1:2-  </b>A fully grown human is just a mass of tissue, and cells.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So you reject the existence of the soul? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No, but if you are going to claim that conception is just a mass of cells then, you must agree that an adult human is a mass of cells too. You have no proof when the soul enters the body or that there is one at all ; the safest thing to assume is that the soul enters the body at conception. Also define what it is to be a    person   , and don    t use your opinion.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You said an adult was " just " a mass of cells. I beg to differ. I'm not interested in playing it safe. Akin to Pascal's wager which is for cowards. If I must use the thoughts of others to define person then why don't you look it up for yourself. Is my opinion invalid when another's given them by dogma is to be unchallenged? Btw you never answered my question as to how you know that a person exists at conception. Please don't be evasive as this is critical. You defer to an unseen authority and mean to impose your beliefs on all. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>And you said : " My common sense suggests that a mass of human tissue that has yet to develop sentience cannot be fairly defined as a " person ". " I beg to differ. Please don't be evasive as this is critical. You defer to an unseen authority and mean to impose your beliefs on all. I thought your arguments would crumble at the point of defining a " person ".<br><b> S2:4-  </b>It's not about crumbling Jimmy. The subject is not as clear cut as you'd like, that's all. You stipulated that I not express my opinion. Here you go then. http://encyclopedia.laborlawtalk.com...ans_persons.3F I defer to no one and I am not hoping to force my beliefs upon others. No one is forced to get an abortion. Will you be answering as to the source of your " knowledge "? Mine is limited to biology.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>... We could go on like this for days... but in the end all one can say is that science has no real conclusion...<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Incorrect : science offers a conclusion, that life is a continuum. This isn't much use for the " when does life start " debate though, so you ignore it. The beginning of the universe? The point at which life started here on earth ( another " line in the sand " issue as there would have been no one single point )? The point at which the egg and sperm that together formed the zygote that became you began their lives? The start of the fertilization process? Which " earliest possible point " are you going to arbitarily choose? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Science doesn't offer a conclusion though!! How many articles do I have to post in order for you to believe this? What about the testimony of the doctors that went to Congress??? Dr. Hymie Gordon ( Mayo Clinic ) : " By all criteria of modern molecular biology, life is present from the moment of conception. " Dr. Micheline Matthews-Roth ( Harvard University Medical School ) : " It is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception " Dr. Alfred Bongioanni ( University of Pennsylvania ) : " I have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception. " and look... another opinion of a doctor http://www.lifeissues.net/writers/ki...febegins2.html I mean, we seriously could ask every doctor and never get a good answer.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I'd hope not. None of those doctors offered a scientific answer by today's standard, but hopefully some are capable of it. If you want a scientific answer then perhaps one should ask a scientist and not a doctor? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Are doctors not included in science either? I don't know if I can go with that one.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>As zachvac says, if they are just expressing opinion, eg " I have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception. " then tere is no science to it. If they have used the scientific method though ( such as experiments that reveal " conception " isn't an instant event ) to come up with their conclusion, then it is science. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You really have the worst definition of science I have ever heard. One does not need to be doing the " scientific method " in order to have findings or be a part of science. A pscyhologist is without a doubt part of science... sometimes they do use a " scientific method " and sometimes they don't. However, it is still a science either way.... just like a doctor<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I also have the most accurate. Whether you therefore like it is irrelevant. Incorrect. Without the use of the scientific method, it ain't science. Full stop ; end of discussion. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I gave you an example... pscyhology is science.. and they don't always use the scientific method. Science means so many things.. I don't know where you are getting this stuff from.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Phychology is a science in some regards, as the scientific method can be used in some experiments to test hypotheses. However it, like other aspects of medicine is constrained by ethical issues surrounding experimenting on people ( especially children ). Therefore much of it is based upon medical empiricism, not science. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>once again, you don't need the scientific method to be considered a science. If you don't believe this, then so be it... but first thing you learn about psychology is it is the science of behavior ( among others ). Science doesn't mean scientific method... all the scientific method is, is a way to conduct an experiment. I know a psychologist ( which is a science ) that comes out with results of things all the time... He doesn't use the " scientific method " yet it is still science. So no matter how much we go threw this in the end science has no real answer on when life begins.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>It depends how loose you want to be with the word. If you consider the humanities such as sociology and economics as sciences, then the word becomes next to meaningless. It is much like calling a " garbage collector " ( as I think you call them in the US ) a " refuse collection engineer ", as this renders the word " engineer " meaningless. If it doesn't employ the scientific method, then it is at best " theoretical science " and at worst it is pure psuedoscience. And so we go around full circle : of course science has no real answer on when life begins as science regards life as a continuum <br><b>S1:7-  </b>Sigh, this conservation is obviously worthless. Eventhough I have shown how science views differ you refuse to look at them. Science is a loose word. Why do think there are so many opinions? Really now, who do you think these people are? You think there is a company called " We Do Science " and all they do is scientific method on things? No. Lots of research is done at universities and companies that do other things. Here at my work ( which is a university ) we have a College of Science and a College of liberal arts and human sciences. Some Departments : Biology Biology -- Fralin Biotechnology Center Biology -- Microbiology Chemistry Economics Geosciences Mathematics Physics Psychology Statistics Large Animal Clinical Sciences Biomedical Sciences and Pathobiology Then we have the The College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Agricultural Technology Agricultural and Applied Economics Agricultural and Extension Education Animal and Poultry Sciences Biochemistry Biological Systems Engineering Crop and Soil Environmental Sciences Dairy Science Entomology Environmental Science Food Science and Technology Horticulture Human Nutrition, Food, and Exercise Plant Pathology, Physiology and Weed Science And look at all the jobs you can have in Science http://www.sciencejobs.com/search.action?reset=true I mean come on now... I don't make this stuff up Political Science<br><b> S2:7-  </b>I am fully aware of that. The meaning of the word " science " has been steadily eroded over the years : you are not the first to use it in a meaningless way. I prefer to stick to using the word in a way that gives it meaning, not the ridiculous modern trend of calling vacuum cleaning and cooking " domestic science " etc. If you choose to see ironing shirts as a real science, then you are a fool and this conversation indeed no longer has any worth. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>I'm not sure what to tell ya... it is what it is. Science has no answer for beginning of life or if life is a contiunum. Depends on who you talk to like I said to start out with.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Ah..! So it nudity were legal you would do it. Well, if you come down under to Bondi beach you can half do it, and it is legal    Wait! Don    t rush we are in winter   <br><b> S2:1-  </b>Sorry to disappoint you but nobody over here has to go all the way over to kangaroo country to go topless... we have places only a few hours away from Toronto for that, but like I said people here just don't do it, it just isn't done! Its a cultural thing. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Big deal! I go topless all the time in my back yard.... and front yard. Australia is sohhhh enlightened. It must be the weather....<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Enlightened or uncivilized? More likely the riff raff heritage of convicts is still pretty strong in Aussie land. We are just more civilized over here, only tourists go to " those kind of beaches " as the locals here say. The locals avoid " those kind of beaches " like the plague and have kept it as far away from Toronto as possible by law.... so sorry! In fact so far there has only been one case of a woman going topless in Toronto proper and it caused a major accident... there was a 10 car pile up on the roads! This is a true story. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>10 car pile up for topless!!! Hmmm   . how many cars for bottomless? :)<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Don't get so snooty about it. It could have happened in kangaroo country too, some crazy woman decided to walk topless in the street downtown Toronto ( not on the beach ). Because of political correctness, the press could not say what nationality she was, but everybody was convinced it was some french tourist... those french always causing mayhem where ever they go! <br><b>S1:4-  </b>If she was French then she was probably good looking, and definitely not fat, as fat french women do not exist.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>When was the last time you went to France?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Steeeeve : Does the grocer need the bread because he or she is starving? Or, does the grocer need the bread to make more money? Is it more moral to make more money than it is to let someone starve? Is it selfish to want something because one is starving? Is that selfishness? Or, desperation? Is profit more important to you than moral justice? Do you understand what moral justice is? Do you worship money? Do you worship the rich?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Did you ever think that selling that bread will allow the grocer to feed his family? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The grocer has only that one loaf of bread? You know, Steeeeve, your saying that makes me think that you have not evolved beyond the basic animalistic instinct of the primitive human to grab everything and hang onto it for dear life, as opposed to a more highly evolved state of humanity where one gives, rather than takes, shares, rather than hoards, forgives and has mercy as opposed to rigidly enforcing archaic laws.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Maybe the grocer needed to sell that loaf of bread to pay rent to keep his business open to support his family? Not that this matters because stealing is still wrong and I wouldn't support it even if it was to save him from starving. You go on this long speech about how primitive humans grab onto everything and hang onto it... you mean like the man stealing the bread? Or gives rather than takes.... you mean like the man stealing the bread ( taking )? Mercy as in killing a human based on size of development? You are all over the place on the issues Simone <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You don't seem to understand, Steeeeve. Starvation can mean death. If someone allows someone to starve to death might that not be murder? Just on the supposition that you can follow that argument, I'm not holding my breath here, is not murder a greater criminal act than stealing? Is the ownership of inanimate property more important than human life? Do property values have precedent over human life?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>no on what level? There is no level of " wrong "... if you are wrong you are wrong. To you they do. To me, not so much. IF someone is starving, I am obligated to help them... if they steal from me, I am obligated to punish them. This isn't a hard concept.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Wrong, wrong. I'm pro-choice ; which means I promote choice. If a rape victim wants to continue her pregnancy, that's fine with me. If she wants an abortion, that's fine with me. Choice. I'm not promoting abortion. And I've said that before. It's relevant b / c I want you to know that sex doesn't always guarantee pregnancy. I should have quite a bunch of kids at this point if that were the case. You don't go to school? Man, how'd you get so lucky? So if you're not pushing and promoting your personal beliefs and morals, what are you doing? Don't people disagree with your opinions on what is moral? How do you reconcile that?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You promote choice, but not abortion? Isn't the particular choice you support the choice to have abortion? I don't think you can support the one without supporting the other at the same time. It doesn't guarantee pregnancy. But it happens frequently enough. Enough to consider what will happen if it does. Huh? Sure they do. And there are some that agree with me too. Obviously, in an abortion issue, personal beliefs have to be included. There are people out there striving to say an early baby is not a person. That is a personal view. Plus, there is a personal view that the baby is a person from conception. Those are personal views, but currently the first one made the law. Only pro-lifer are poked in the chest because of their personal views when the pokers themselves don't even realize the reasons that make them pro-abortionists stemmed from their own personal views. So lets stop this personal view thing, pro-abortionists act the same way. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I support women's choice ; to do with their bodies as they please. I'm not walking around town carrying signs that say " Have an abortion, they're great! " or " Everyone should have an abortion! " or " Choose abortion! It's the best choice! " I support women's choice ; no matter what that might be. People can make their own personal decisions without my involvement. Friends can come to me, and I'll support their decisions, even if I don't agree with it. ( You said " Huh " to my question ; " how did you get out of school? " ) I meant, really, how did you get out of going to school, you lucky bug? :) I don't think you understand what it means to be pro-choice. You're pushing your morals on the masses. I'm want people to choose their morals. If I was pushing my views, I would be telling people to get an abortion, like you're telling people not to. Instead, I'm encouraging society to allow people to make their own decisions. Does that make sense? It's been a long day.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Oh, I get it now. I though when you said " pro-choice " you meant the choice to have an abortion. I see now. I do homeschool work. I do study math, english, science ect. My Mom chose to do homeschooling because of personal reasons. Allowing people to make their own decisions is fine. That I agree with. I guess I have a better understanding now of how the pro-choice person is. But I still hold my belief that morals play a part in this issue, whether it's constitutional or not. There is eventually going to be a moral absolute in the ultimate debate on this, regardless of moral-less people. The law is already built on morals, I don't think anything unconstitutional would be commited by prohibiting it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Could you please clarify what you mean when you say " moral-less people "? What is a moral-less person? ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Currently, the law which you say " is already built on morals " allows for abortions. So... maybe you'd like a chance to reconsider your statement :<br><b> S2:3-  </b>A person without morals. Remember that I said morals. I did not say " good " morals or " my " morals. The fact is that it is, trying to completely obstruct morals from the law is futile. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I've never met or heard of a person without morals. Have you? I'm sure you mean people without what in your opinion are " good " morals. ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><b> S2:4-  </b>If you're confused by my last post, I'll explain it. Trying to use a moral to impose a law will never work. Morals are included, but if you gave that as one of your main reasons for creating a law, they would never allow it.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>So what does make something right? A little off topic, I know, but I'm curious about how you assign moral values to things.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I can only sspeak for myself but I received most of my moral values and beliefs from my parents and my 14 years of Catholic education...... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I think you misunderstand me. I'm asking you to explain what your reasons are for deciding what moral values things have. What method do you use for determining if something is right?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>My experience.......... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Okay, and how do you understand those experiences in terms of moral value?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I believe I am a man of high principles and moral values, now if you don't have any other questions of me can we get back on topic........ I believe I have answered your question........... Thanks........<br><b>S1:1-  </b>We are not the ones who need something to get us through the night. Remember we are the ones who care more for a living human being than a clump of cells.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>you are a clump of cells <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Coming from you, I guess thats a compliment. Likewise.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I am... It wasn't really a compliment or an insult... you just happen to be a clump of cells... lots of cells. What do you think you are made of? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Which means you must be a clump of cells too. The question is whether you have a brain and heart like the rest of the posters in this forum and every other breathing human being.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I am a clump of cells... those were the first words of my last post. So do you have to have a brain, heart, and be breathing to be a human? Who set this rule? Some people have smaller brains then others.. are they " less " of a person? During a heart transplant is that person not a person when their heart is removed? If you hold your breath are you not a person? Your standard can't be proven nor does it make sense. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The point is even if they have a smaller brain, they still have a brain. And the point is even in a heart transplant, the person has to get a heart to live. No heart, the person dies. And the point is even if you hold your breath, you have to breath after sometime to live. No breathing for a more than a few minutes and you die. None of these examples are in any way comparable to a fertilized egg. The fertilized egg does not have any brain ( small or otherwise ). Even if you transplant a heart into a fertilized egg, it cannot survive in the open. has heart and still dies. Has no lungs to even hold its breath........ Boy what an absurd comparison!<br><b> S2:4-  </b>A fetus has a brain, heart, and doesn't have to breath to live. If you talk about a fertilized egg then we still get back to the question who makes you the determiner of what a human is? Just because someone has to be in a certain enviroment to live shouldn't make them any less of a human. However, I don't get to make that call for someone else either. So I suggest that only each of us can determine for ourselves only whether or not we are a human at that point in time. Can't ask a fertilized egg? well better play it safe until you can... not have the ability to say is not a pass to make the decision for him / her. If it is a human / person ( or whatever ) one can't morally or legally kill it ( legally stated in roe vs wade for US only ). Morally, I would say most people find the killing of an innocent to be wrong. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I did not even mention the word ' fetus ' in my reply to you...... so I am puzzled why you used that word. As I recall I was writing about a fertilized egg.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>ok? are you offended or something? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>My question remains unanswered.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>which was? <br><b>S1:7-  </b>Why you used the word fetus, when I was talking about fertilized eggs.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>because I felt like it...<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Ok for the sake of arguement, lets say that abortion is made illegal. What is going to happen, abortions are still going to take place, only this time instead of going to doctors, women will be forced to go to butchers, which will result in abortions plus women's lives being put in jeapordy. The rich will always do what they always do and will not be affected by it. Does this accomplish anything rather than making you feel better that abortion is illegal. It is ridiculous to compare abortion to murder. Murder is not a medical procedure. Abortion is a medical procedure which if performed by a quack or a butcher carries with it the risk of death, infertility and other complications.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Abortion is not murder? What about the baby being aborted? Abortion is controversial for the simple fact that many people consider the procedure murder. Many doctors in Germany during WWII committed murder by experimenting on human subjects. They knew beforehand that death would be the outcome, such as seeking to determine how long a person would survive at simulated high altitudes, and all for a good cause, by the way, to save the life of pilots. ( utilitarian ethics ). And many of these results were used by doctors belonging to the Allied countries without qualms, but this is another ethical issue. So medical practice can be murder. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Now you are confusing torture with abortion. So you consider a fertilized egg of say 3 weeks a baby. It has not developed any human organs yet, how can it feel pain? The example you gave above is of doctors torturing breathing human beings by performing medical experiments on them. Lets not confuse the two issues here. One is torture, the other is a medical procedure to abort in most cases a ' clump of cells ' which has not yet developed human organs and hence cannot feel any pain. Whether you consider abortion ' murder ' depends on many factors such as religion, morality, etc.. and also the development stages of the fetus. In fact in some countries once the fetus starts to develope human organs, abortion is not permitted whereas in other countries abortion is permitted right up to 9 months..... But I would not equate the aborting of a fertilized egg of 3 weeks with the murder of a breathing human being by say shooting him / her. Totally different.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Don    t accuse people of confusion when you are confused. Torture is to inflict pain on a person as a form of punishment or to induce the person to behave in a certain manner, for instance to force the person to confess. Pain in the medical experiments I referred to was not intentional but a consequence of the experiment. The Nazis did not resource to experimentation to cover torture. If they wanted to torture people they simply tortured them. Don    t you think that the baby killed by being forcibly torn from the womb suffer pain before dying? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>That fact that you are confused is plain for everyone to see, infact your name should be ' confusion reigns ' Torture is torture whether intentional or unintentional. What are you saying in your usual confused manner, that just because in the medical experiements, torture is unintentional, it is not torture? Please clarify what you mean by a ' baby " being aborted ( we don't have to use your gruesome description here ). So you think a fertilized egg of say 3 - 6 weeks which has not developed any human organs can feel pain when aborted? Now suddenly you have started using the word " baby "? is this for the purposes of being melodramatic? Yeah sounds a lot like those melodramatic SA soaps we see on TV where there is a meltdown every five minutes.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Why don    t you consult a dictionary before trying to debate an issue? To torture is to intentionally cause pain, if not, it is not torture. For instance reading your postings is painful but whether this constitutes torture or not depend on your intentions. Abortion is a medical procedure that causes the death of the foetus by forcibly removing it from the womb. Whether this constitutes murder or not depend on the point in time it was performed. According to some persons in these Forums if it happened before the foetus became a person, no murder occurred. I don    t give a hoot about sterile semantic discussions ; in my opinion if the foetus feels pain it an abortion should be not allowed and the pregnancy should continue. Now if the mother doesn    t want the baby then an adoption would be the solution. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>1 ) Yes, yes, yes! my postings are definitely meant to torture you. What goes around comes around. 2 ) Is destroying an embyro in a petri dish in the science lab murder? If that is murder to you, then you should be against stem cell reasearch otherwise you have a double standard. 3 ) Easy for you to make comments about abortion and tell women what they should do ( like giving up the baby for adoption ) as you will never find yourself faced with any of these decisions.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>At least I am not the only sufferer, I can see other poor souls around here also the victims of your postings. Who said that laughter wasn    t painful? It is if in excess, therefore I only read one of your postings at a time to make the pain bearable. How is the    clump of cells    doing today by the way? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I guess you are a expert on this subject - torture. You have a lot of experience in this area ( I have witnessed it and been a victim of it many a times ). But don't worry about me, your kind of germanic torture which is the inflicting of excruciating pain and mental anguish can never be surpassed by ANYBODY. Maybe the reason you can only answer one of my postings is because my other postings are so logically constructed, flawless and above all right on the mark, so you cannot answer them... to answer them you will have to admit that you were wrong. But then again you are usually wrong. Oh and calling you a clump of cells will be too kind!<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I wonder how the pro-infanticide liberals liked Obama's Presidential order that says no federal funding for abortion? How's that hope and change working out for you?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>When backed into a corner he never answers questions, he just repeats the same over and over again. He didn't even answer my last question. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>May a troubling case of incontinence result in your trading in your current clunker for a 25 HP port-a-potty.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Like I said, he doesn't answer questions and he tries to distract you from the argument when backed into a corner. Redundant. Sounds like a stereotype to me. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Any man who rejects Jesus Christ is a liar ( 1 John 2:22 ), so we know Shooter's continuing rants can't be trusted.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Having an intelligent discussion with you is harder than passing a kidney stone. You still haven't answered any of my questions. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You're full of it. Pick your best one ( just your best 1 ) and let's see that bad boy.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Sorry, my lord, but just under 60 years ago your kind were beating their wives for not properly covering their ankles. Were you sarcastic when you proclaimed your belief in talking snakes and literal floods? That hardly seems fair, Posiden, but I'll play : Where is your proof? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Originally Posted by Easyrider : Nice try but the first man alive was Adam and his God is the God of the Bible.

Jesus said he would raise himself from the dead ( " Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it again. " He was speaking of the temple of his body ). If Christ can do that, and if he is risen, then what he says, and the premise of Christianity, are solid. That would include Jesus ' statements on Genesis, what the prophets prophesied, etc. But it looks like you can't bust the resurrection, so you're weak. If it were such a sham you, WITH YOUR BRILLIANT MIND, should be able to bust it in a heartbeat. But you can't, can you? Also, did you answer Archangel's question about where in the Bible it says the world is 6,000 years old? That's another hairbrained argument you people buy into because you haven't done your due-diligence and studied the issue.<br><b> S2:8-  </b>You epically fail to take into account the fact that the bible was passed down through many generations of oral tradition before it was written down. Don't you think the story got a bit distorted and exaggerated during those hundreds of years? Do you actually think there were talking snakes, virgin births, and resurrections from the dead? Or has it crossed your mind that these " truths " may have been inadvertently distorted through the centuries, like all stories passed through oral tradition are? Once you can prove to me that the content of the Bible stayed exactly true, even after being told for hundreds of years ( very unlikely ), then we can talk.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I'd like to introduce you to the bigger picture : Psalm 1 39:13 - ' For you created my inmost being ; you knit me together in my mother's womb.

We don't butcher the unborn. Nor do most of Americans share yours. See my Biblical references above. Go climb on a parking meter, dweeb. And tell your stiff-necked, spiritually constipated family members to quit imitating the devil and stop killing the innocent unborn.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>OOOHH!! Such ANGER!!! What is it about you righties that impels you to resort to ad hominem attacks on those whose opinion differs from yours? Must be that your quiver quivers for the lack of the arrows of substance. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>People like you who defend the infanticide of the innocent unborn. I think you people need to clean the abortionist's sinks when you're done, and bury the dead, so you can see the end product of your demented and ungodly immoral relativism.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>" Demented and ungodly ", eh? Your rant is totally off base and irrelevant to those of us who do not equate abortion with infanticide. Spare us your phony rage. :( <br><b>S1:4-  </b>And your belief is contrary to God's will, as I previously documented. One day you will be held to account for it. There's nothing phony about it. Just wish I could legally deport you.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>1. How DARE you to speak as one who claims to know the will of God. Besides which, we are not living in a theocracy. If you want one of those, Iran might just be to your liking. 2. This Springsteen-American is staying right where he is, thank you very much. This Springsteen-American has just as much right to fly the flag of the USA outside his house as you do - more in fact. 3. This Springsteen-American has enough confidence in the women of his family to make choices that are in their best interest without any help from the likes of you. Keep your poison away from them! <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Murder is murder, whether it's the old or the unborn. It's not rocket science. And I dare greatly, thank you! Strawman. You don't have to live in a theocracy to know murding the innocent unborn is wrong. Actually, Iran might be more to your liking since they don't value life very much either. Fly your flag, but don't think for a moment that the God who brought this nation forth approves of the mass infanticide of the innocent unborn. Godly women don't kill their unborn. They nurture them. As for poision, you're the ones who advocate death and infanticide, not me.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>This is what I typed that some claim is " begging the question "... aside from the obvious clown face which might hint towards me kidding, I think it might be safe to say that any reasonable person would know that you really don't need a license from the UN for makign decisions. I guess sarcasm is not known here.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>But the fact that you don't need a license from the UN has nothing to do with what I accused you of begging the question for. It was for the phrase " killing Someone. " ( Whether it is someone being killed, not something, is the sticking point of the abortion debate ). I understand that you do not actually believe the part about the UN. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>my mistake I thought you quoted something else... either way.. it is still not begging the question as my conclusion was not basis for my premise.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>What the hell are you talking about? Look, let me lay it out for you : 1. The critical sticking point between the two sides of the debate is, is the fetus a morally considerable thing? ( or, a " person, " or a " someone " ) 2. To assume the sticking point of an argument to make that argument, or an argument in support of your side of the sticking point is called " begging the question. " 3. You assumed that a fetus was a someone when attempting to refute a point related to the abortion debate's sticking point. 4. Therefore, you begged the question. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>with that poor standard of what " begging the question " means you do it all the time. You assume that the sticking point is what you said it is in your arguement so by your standard you begged the question yourself.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>That is the standard, and if I do it, you should call me on it. I understand that to be the sticking point. If you do not think that it is the sticking point, then I wish you would tell me what the actual sticking point is. If you cannot tell me what the actual sticking point is, then you are wrong in your assertion, and you should apologize. Were you not? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Some believe a right to personal autonomy is over a right to life... so they believe it is a human but that is below the " right " to personal autonomy. So you are making an assumption about the sticking point being what you say it is. Either way, you are using " begging the question " incorrectly in my opinion so I am not gonna call you on it because that is not what it is. You already assumed I was, so too late for corrections.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Good point. However, I think this approach is marginal at best. That's true, I am. However, making an assumption is not the same thing as begging the question, which is a particular type of assumption. Then your opinion would be contrary to fact. If you want to call me on it, I suggest you reread the entry first. You didn't answer my question. You said I assumed X. If X is the case, then this is not a problem. The problem comes up when X is not the case, or X is under dispute. So I ask you again, was I wrong? Do you disagree?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Thanks for agreeing that there is a qualitative difference between a person and a fetus.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Abortion is the killing of an innocent human being. And the people who do that will have to answer to God in due time. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Just which god might that be? Yahweh? Krishna? he Great Spirit? Allah? Please specify.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The Great God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The Lord Jesus Christ. The older dog. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And just exactly WHY should one particular religious faith determine the civil law? We are a multireligious nation, and there are others who are of NO religious faith. Why should their values and behavior be dictated by something they do not accept as Gospel ( Meaning intended! ) P<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You mean an unborn baby is not a human being? What were you? As far as religion goes, this country wasn't founded on Buddhism or atheism, nor are the majority of Americans today anything other than Christians. We have just as much right to lobby for what we believe is right as do the imbeciles at the Wall Street demonstrations. Don't kill the innocent unborn for the sins or convenience of the parents.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Thanks for agreeing that there is a qualitative difference between a person and a fetus.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>When does a fetus become a ' person '? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The answer to that question depends very much upon which system of belief, ethics, and morals one subscribes to. For most Jews, it is at crowning during the process of birth. For the RC sect of Christians, it is at conception. Other Christian sects place it at different points along that continuum. This leads inexorably to the conclusion that there is NO one " right " answer. as a result, the proper course for the law is to remain silent and to leave the choice where it properly belongs - with each pregnant woman.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I wasnt referring to religious belief, I was asking when a fetus becomes a person. You assert that a sentient fetus that can feel pain and stress should be painfully destroyed if the pregnant mother decides that what she wants? I am not anti abortion but I am against aborting a fetus that would suffer during a termination. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I assert that, as a man. I am not entitled to answer the question. What I do find interesting is that when people talk about universals, those universals universally correspond to THEIR values.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You assert that you should have no influence or opinion on the suffering of a sentient human that is defined as a fetus you mean. Maybe you dont feel man enough. How does your interesting find on universals have any relevance regarding my post? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>1. Exactly so, since the choice of whether or not to accept the hypothesis that a fetus is sentient is very much a mater of discussion among those with the knowledge that gives their opinions weight.. 2. I believe in the strength of each woman's intellect that she is capable of choosing what is in her best interest, and her best interest is controlling. 3. YOU claim that the prohibition gains abortion is or should be a universal, and that corresponds to YOUR values when others disagree who are just as moral and ethical as you. Ideologues more often than not believe that their word is law in the universe.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>So if it was deemed by ' those with the knowledge that give their opinion weight ' that a fetus can feel pain and stress during a termination you would agree that the termination should not be carried out.. well done Then you are contradicting your last statement I claim nothing more than a termination should not be done if there is enough evidence that the fetus is sentient enough to suffer during the process. If the fetus is developed enough to suffer ( and therefore sentient ) it should be considered an individual and it should be very carefully considered before performing an abortion. You are the one claiming universal idealogies can you not read what you write? You are claiming that in every pregnancy from conception to term the pregnant woman should have the right to terminate the pregnancy for whatever reason she sees fit.. if you do not understand that to be a universal idealogy to fit YOUR values then you really do not understand your own<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Sigma, Yes, I said that and I was quoting you. Please try to keep up with your own posts :) You said that a woman's physical, emotional, and mental status should not be sacrificed so that another could live. I think that the baby's physical, emotional, and mental status should not be sacrificed so the mother can maintain her current living situation.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Trust me, I know what I said, even if I realize I misspoke later on. Since you do not believe the fetus ' physical, emotional, and mental state should be sacrificed, why do you believe that the woman's should be? Arguably so. Pulling the plug could be described as both. Again, arguably so. A STD and a pregnancy are both possible consequences of sex. On one, you argue " they consented to the possible consequences of sex " on the other you believe they should be able to be treated. It is a contradiction. Even though one is a human life, both are subject to the same argument, so if you believe one but not the other there is something wrong with the argument. I am glad you agree :) I do not understand, then, why you wish to force motherhood on women, which seems counterproductive to wishing motherhood be wanted. Nor do either of us apply it :P It is up to the doctors to decide. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Sigma, I saw an opening for a quick jab so I took it Fly like a butterfly... I was playing on your words. I was implying that the fetus ' physical, emotional, and mental state are irrevocably obliterated whereas the mother's physical, emotional, and mental state are temporarily altered. I think something is wrong with an argument that compares treating an STD with killing a fetus. You think they are similar?. Motherhood should never be viewed as a punishment or as being forced. We should work to have people thinking of pregnancy and children as a blessing / gift no matter what the situation is. The manner in which one becomes pregnant should not mar the view of the child that results.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>;) Temporary, perhaps. It depends on the situation. I don't believe removing her rights, even on a temporary basis, is morally right. They are similar in some ways. I am comparing the ways that they are similar, since your argument can be used for the ways they are similar ( ie, they are both consequences of sex ). The only way that everyone would view them as such is if there are no unwanted pregnancies. I believe that will only happen if women have the right to stop pregnancies that they do not want. Then each child that is born is a wanted child. If the pregnancy is required after a rape, I do not see how you can expect that the woman will simply forget about the rape while pregnant. Requiring that the woman continue the pregnancy by law is legislating a consequence that the woman may not want. I do not see how that is not punishing the woman. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Sigma, Her right to kill is not legitimate. Killing a child and treating an STD are two very different actions. The best way might be to value sex as more than a casual pleasure and recognizing the fruit of sex. I don't think the child should be punished for the rape. The woman will never forget a rape but I don't think the woman is being punished by allowing a child to live.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Legitimate to whom? How to change thier condition does change. I have not argued differently. However, your argument excludes treatment for both. Your argument does not mention how to stop or change their condition, it focuses on the fact that they accepted to the possibility when they had sex. Perhaps. Outlawing abortion will not do this thing. It will only recognize the fruit of sex as superior to the woman carrying it. More philosophically, why should sex be more than an expression of love and the pleasure of physical contact? Only the woman. I believe that if it is legislated and is undesirable, it is being used as a punishment. I find it morally reprehensible that you believe that she should be forced to continue a pregnancy because of rape. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>To anyone. The court had no right to grant a right to kill. The court had no right to void the foundation of our forefathers in recognizing the right to life as inalienable. Treating an STD and killing a child are two very different actions. Not superior. Equally valuable. Why should it be more than an expression of love and pleasure? Because it is more than an expression of love and pleasure. It has an inherent function of producing children. No. I do not believe that a woman should be forced to continue pregnancy because of a rape. I believe a woman should continue a pregnancy because of a child. I believe that she should continue her pregnancy in spite of rape.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Certainly legitimite to me, and I daresay to the majority of America. Our " forefathers " gave those rights to all those who fall under the constitution. You're very neatly avoiding the question Not equally valuable. When the fetus is granted the right to live in her body against her will, it's rights to her body are superior to hers. And we should never interfere with any natural process, is that it? Care to back that up? You say that we shouldn't punish the fetus for the rape, but it is very probable that you will be delaying and preventing her physical and mental recovery, and with that daily reminder of what happened she may never be able to forget. I would call that punishing the woman. Poor wording on my part I apologize. I believe it is morally wrong to force a woman to continue a pregnancy that was a result of rape. Physical, emotional and mental recovery should take precedence, not the forced delivery of something she does not want, that perhaps will remind her of what happened 9 months ago that she was trying to get past.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>This is going way too far off. Lets go back to basics here. Steeeve, why do you feel a fetus can ovveride her right to her own body? Right on!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Well you assume a right to your own body exists for one. But lets assume it does. What makes you think a right to life is below it? In any other conflict i could think of between " right to own body " and " right to life ", life will always win. I guess the first question is... how do you define " right to your own body " Furthermore, we seem to place more value on a " life " anyway. I mean the punishment for taking a life is sometimes your own.... meaning the taking of your " right to life " is a worse punishment than say taking away your " right to your body ". <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Even though a fetus is a life, and ant is a life too. Should we make ant squishing illegal too because we would like to value life more? I mean, Ants have a right to life too, but you're not ranting about ant squishing. Could you please elaborate? Then let us choose which we want. Now shoo!<br><b> S2:2-  </b>[ QUOTE = Shooterandproud ; 237701 ] Even though a fetus is a life, and ant is a life too.

Sure, thats your choice, just be ready to face the consequences. Yes, we are reffering to real humans. Real humans having rights to their own bodys, and not a fetus growing in their stomach make their descisions for them.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Fine, I say we have consequences for abortion.... mainly jail time for those that perform it. A fetus is a " real human ".... so not sure what your point is. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>First you say reproductive health doctors should get jail time and now you're saying a fetus is a real human? erm... ok?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>That is a pretty good summary I'd say. Well yes, pro-choice thinks the mother has rights, pro-life thinks both have rights. So you shoulda said " think the fetus has rights too ". Not even close to like rape but if you like to do that then I can just say abortion is like murder... so you have a choice between murder and rape. Great choices. Huh? Your statements ( together ) are starting to border on a strawman. Certainly not unconstitutional but what does outlaw condom and birth control pills have to do with anything? I never mentioned birth control.... starting a strawman here. Should you kill everyone that is unwanted? If you are unwanted can we kill you without punishment? If a 2 month old baby is unwanted can they kill him or her? Selfish to kill for your personal gain. The fetus didn't have a choice to be " sucking her resources ". How can you be selfish when you can't do something to become selfish? Makes no sense.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>That's just your opinion however. To me, the early stages of a fetus aren't really " human ". - Wez<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And that is just your opinion........ Have you ever asked yourself, What if I am wrong? Probably not......... So I guess you are against abortion in the 3rd trimester then becasue babies at that can and have survived outside the womb........ <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Hence the fact I stated it as my opinion. She did not. Unless the mother's life is endangered, I'd most likely be against them. - Wez<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Who did not? So if the mothers life is not endangered in the 3rd trimester and the baby is viable outside the womb you would be against and abortion? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Swimming FISHX Barring serious physical deformities / mental damage, or in some exceptional circumstances, then yes I would be against such an abortion. Yes, that's what I meant. :) - Wez<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well at lest I thank you for that.......... As far as I am concerned it would have to depend on how serious the deformity or other damage is......... There have been great gains in medical science in a lot of those areas and i think the baby at least deserves a chance to live...........<br><b>S1:1-  </b>That is what no one who wants to ban gay marriages will explain to me... just why it is a ' threat '? I don't see what the BFD is... people should be with the one they love and if one segment of society can benefit from govt. recognized marriage, every segment should have the same opportunity. That's true conservativism... equal opportunity for all.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Maybe that's because there doesn't need to be a " threat " to heterosexual marriage in order for the government to ( justifiably ) recognize one form of marriage over the other,... and to remain indifferent to all the variations. One man one woman marriage is the template that best fits the " general welfare " concerns for the government. ( As generally speaking our society is built upon the one man one woman marriage and family structure ) Marriage must be defined by our government ( article 1 section 8) for the purposes of making imigration and naturalization laws,... in addition to property rights laws and such regarding divorce, inheritence, etc. It's simply a matter of " man's law " following " natural law " IN THE GENERAL SENSE. No matter how much the outcry, gays and gay marriage is not the natural " norm " of society. It's hilarious, how those who DENY the very personhood of a pre-birth child demand the rights and recognition of gays to marry,.... and they use a thread about abortion of all places to do it. I shouldn't say it's hilarious,... But I'm at a loss for a better word. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Then why is are they called marriage ' protection ' laws and the Defence of Marriage Act? Monogomous Relationships are the boon.... if someone can only be happy with a same sex partner they sould be able to expirence all the benifits that govt. gives to anyone else. I had gay rats. I've seen gay dogs. I've met kids that you just KNOW are gonna be gay... sounds natural to me. And again, if its good for one set of people those rights should be availabe to all people. No the ' norm ' will always be divorc   e lol. I don't deny personhood of pre-birth children, but I support a woman's right to control her body. I also support the death penalty for people who deserve it... but that's all for another thread.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Beats me,.. I didn't write em. Yeah,... so sould bigamists and incestors. Everyone is entitled to all the benifits of the government. Without exception! Yeah,.. the minimalistic approach to a government sanctioning only the things most likely to insure the infrastructure of a society,.... From now on " anything goes! " Ok, so you don't deny the personhood of prebirth children,... do you acknowledge their personhood? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>[ QUOTE ] But you do feel that you must ' protect ' marriage. What would it hurt to allow committed people to marry? THat's my point... married people get special benifits. If a gay person wants to gain these benifits they must have a sham marriage to a woman or be allowed to marry someone they actually love... The govt. which governs best is that which governs least. Sure. They're gonna be people. No problem. Still, if someone doesn't want to keep it growing inside her, that's her choice. I hate that some have to make that choice but it is their choice.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>[ QUOTE = CUNxTime ;3 53431 ] Show me what I have ever said to lead you to that conclusion? To the contrary, I have told you that one does NOT need to view homosexual unions as a threat in order to oppose a government recognition of them. And I have explained for you my reasons why. ( General welfare, minimalistic government, article 1 section 8, etc ) This red herring / non sequitur statement is a sham in and of itself. Insinuating that heterosexuals marry " for the benefits. " Maybe some couples do. But the vast majority marry out of love and a want to start a family, etc. In my opinion, the government is right to recognize and even reward the type marriages that best meet the " general welfare " requirments of article 1, section 8 of the Constitution. Period. Nothing more, nothing less. Keeping in mind that there are legitimate roles for the government to play,... absolutely. Gonna be?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Do you? I believe that homosexuality is just as gentically influenced as is a person's heterosexuality. I also believe that there is a lot of people somewhere in the middle and that their sexuality also is for the most part " genetic. " So, ( in my opinion ) saying that homosexuality should be illegal is a lot like saying that people who are left handed or born with red hair should be criminalized. It would be idiotic to do that. Anthony 321 Yes it would. Chuz Life Not because making babies is a requirment for marriage,... but because making babies and rearing them to be productive citizens is most suited to the nations " general welfare " using the one man one woman relationship. Gay's can " marry " all they want,... call it whatever they want,... I personally don't care. But I'll still defend the governments right to define marriage as IT sees fit to meet the " general welfare " needs of the nation,... even if that means treating all the other variations to marriage with indifference.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Anthony 321 Does your selected group of those worthy of marriage include left handed people? How about red headed people? I am quite sure it does. A few paragraphs ago homosexuals were part of the left handed red headed members of society. Suddenly where marriage is concerned homosexuals are left at the back of the bus. What is about them that makes you feel that they should not be able to be married? What is about red headed and / or left handed people that makes you feel they should be able to marry? Anything that makes it okay to treat law abiding, tax paying, hard working citizens of a free nation, with indifference is not okay! Two consenting adults is not a variation on marriage. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I said several posts ago that Gays could still " marry " even in the absense of Governmental Recognition. You must have skipped that part.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Anthony 321 This issue is dealing with governmental recognition. And you are well aware of that. Would you be so kind as to reply to my former post, now that you know that I know that gay people are already allowed to have make believe marriages. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Must I? Then why ( other than to ridicule and flame ) do you ask? You just acknowledged that I do believe they can " marry " even in the absense of government recognition. So, I don't know where you are getting the idea that I " feel that they should not be able to marry. " It's my reading of the the Constitution that leads me to accept that the Government has the authority and the discretion to define marriage as it sees fit in making laws which " promote the general welfare. " ( Article 8, section 1 ) Nothing more. Two brothers? Two sisters? The State has the right and the responsibility to define marriage as it sees fit to promote the general welfare. The State has the right to exercise discretion in that vein. Indifference is not discrimination.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Anthony 321 You still have not answered what it is about homosexuals that makes them not worthy of legal marriage? The kind of legal marriage that red haired, left handed people are allowed to have. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>That's because I have no opinion on the " worthiness " of homosexual relationships. ( legally married or not. ) That's what I mean when I say " indifference is not discrimination. "<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You have just applied a test to see if there is a person in the coffin, where is the test for the unborn?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>There has already been many, and they prove that an embryo does not have mental existence. Hence, they are legally dead. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>How does something dead grow?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I never said it was dead. However, a plant is technically legally dead, as in it has no mental existence and no brain, yet it still grows. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>A plant is very much alive.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Are you telling me a plant has a brain and can think? That it mentally exists? Of course it is alive, so are my kidneys, but that doesn't automatically make them people. They must be sentient to be people. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>a   live (   - l   v ' ) adj. Having life ; living.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>How else can I interpret this? You said :    you would forcefully have her take her pregnancy to term   . Yet you would do the same later in the pregnancy. Therefore we both use force. Why did you bother to state that I force if not to suggest it is wrong?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Though I would like to finish this particular discussion, this question at least moves the discussion forward. I talked about abortion in the early trimesters being a responsible answer to unwanted pregnancy and that it has the advantage of letting the woman choose whereas you would force her. I will grant you that, since I did not specifically say in that paragraph that I would allow abortion to be outlawed ( i.e. pregnancy forced ) in the third trimester ( though I have said it in many other posts ), that might have left room for you to jump to conclusions that I think all such force is wrong. So, just to get this discussion over with, I'll strike a compromise : You were wrong for jumping to conclusions and I was wrong for leaving things unsaid which made it easier for you to jump to those conclusions. Fine? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not an acceptable compromise, I was left with no other conclusion than to interpret your comment as though I was wrong for using force, yet your own use is not. It was clearly double standards.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The conclusion which you jumped to was that I think all use of force is wrong. You jumped to this conclusion based on my claim that use of force in this particular situation ( early trimesters ) is wrong. I cannot be blamed for your extrapolation. I have presented a reasonable compromise that you have rejected. I see that there is no way to reach an agreement so, unless you introduce some new compelling arguement, I will just drop this discussion. I, and probably any others who might still be reading this, no longer find any usefulness to the discussion. Bye - onto other threads / subjects. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So what you want me to accept is : You can use force when you like, but if I use force, it is wrong, and you will not debate any more unless I accept this. You don't know how to debate.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Please don't misrepresent my view. I said that the use of force ( through law ) has to be justified. I generally like freedom so I think the use of force should be avoided unless it has justifications. You are not wrong in using force because it is you who said it. If you present good justifications for the use of force in outlawing abortion in the early trimesters, then that use of force would be valid. However, I haven't seen good justifications coming from you. Of course, all of our opinions on what is a just arguement and what isn't are based on our own views. You might think my use of force in wanting violent anti-abortion protests curtailed unjust. The justice or injustice of our views has to rest mainly on our arguements. Personally, I would prefer to delve more deeply into these arguements than to continue this discussion ( which I have broken my own intentions in continuing - mostly because I would prefer not to leave the discussion on a misunderstanding of my arguements ). <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I'm not misrepresenting your view. You said I was wrong for using force, yet you claimed the use of force is right when you use it. That is a fair summation of the debate. You didn't claim I was wrong for any other reason other than force. It is double standards.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I said you were wrong in using force *** IN THAT SITUATION***. That doesn't mean that I think it is wrong for you to use force in any situation. Also, I did not claim the use of force is right whenever I use it. Neither of us can justify the use of force unless we present valid arguements to support that force. If you want to discuss those arguments, I would be happy to. At least such a discussion will serve a purpose. I am convinced now that you will not stop misinterpreting my views until you get me to admit to something I am not guilty of - that is something I am unwilling to do. I see we will have to agree to disagree - at least I see that we will continue to disagree. I have little doubt that you will keep harping on this issue. I personally see now that there is no hope in resolving this issue so it is best to drop it. Again, I am willing to go into discussions on justifiable reasons for using force through law where abortion is concerned. As for this inane arguement, I really am stopping my participation here since I need to log off and leave the computer. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Exactly, so I'm not wrong on those grounds, you need to find a reason why I'm wrong, if there is one, you have yet to present it. Then, and only then can you mount an argument to claim I'm wrong, until then please don't make inaccurate accusations.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Would you allow a woman to abort a perfectly healthy baby that is two days from being born?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So, he's expected to just answer your question, but you don't hold yourself to those same standards and answer his question. Typical. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>He has not answered my question.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>What the heck are you on about? You just quoted his very answer in post number 121. Here is how it went : you asked a question, expected him to answer it, then when he answered it and then asked a question of you, you asked another question, expecting him to answer that as well, and not answering his. Now he has answered this latest question, and you have yet to answer his. Hold yourself to your own standards, dude. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>My question has not been answered : I want to know how I : " would forcefully have her take her pregnancy to term ". How?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The answer was given in post #120, which you yourself quoted in post #121. Now stop your dishonesty and answer the question. This will be my last post to you here until you own up to your own standards. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>It is too bad that you feel the need to concede.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Elucidate. I'm not talking about the wanted unborn, I'm talking about all the    Unwanted Unborn   . Like I said : I'm not talking about the wanted unborn, I'm talking about all the    Unwanted Unborn   .<br><b> S2:1-  </b>If I order a chicken salad sandwich but you give me egg salad can I send it back for cause? Btw fetuses don't represent an ethnic group. Are you purposely being thick or is it a condition? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Do you dispute that unborn humans are human?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Why is unplugging brain dead humans not murder? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You tell me.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Can one spill an empty vessel? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So when I asked : " Do you dispute that unborn humans are human? ". What you are saying is : No.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You must find this style of debate most effective. To answer in my own words - I don't dispute that early fetuses are human, I don't think it can be shown they are humans. Now, care to answer either of my questions? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>So you think they are not humans. What are they if they are not humans? What species are they?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>To answer you I would be using human as an adjective. Human as noun implying " human being " otherwise referred to as " person " is what I think there's a problem in demonstrating for early fetuses.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You will never be satisfied, no matter what I present. Genocide in all its forms kills the inconvenient, a fact that is present in all genocide.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Perhaps if you would present something using valid logic people might believe what you say. You seem to be suffering greatly from attachment to one of the simplest of false logics. Commies wear red hats. John wears a red hat. John is a Commie. This is false logic. You miss the main identifier of genocide... it is an effort to WIPE OUT a group... not a vehicle to kill a selected few of a group. Roe vs. Wade merely gives people a legal way to abort... it does not compel abortion. Get some help in the logic department. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Legalising abortion became the systematic process that was vital in order to identify abortion as genocide, and it is the only method that can allow for the entire destruction of the unwanted unborn.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It is you that has misidentified abortion as genocide. It clearly does not fit the definition. ( You do realize that we use words AS THEY ARE DEFINED to produce meaningful sentences, don't you? ) What legalized abortion does is reduce the number of illegal and inherently dangerous ( often deadly ) abortions that will take place in the absense of legal means. Get used to it. Many people do not want to have children and they get ' stuck ' with one accidently. Your insistence that they should have known better has no bearing on the situation. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>LINK Read it, or better yet read the entire thread.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I did. You merely repeat the same invalid ' logic ' you have presented here. genocide = the systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial, political or cultural group. If the law included a method by which some appointed group would determine who gets abortions, you might have a point in that the system could be skewed to abort all blacks or all hispanics or all christians or all blondes. However, that is not the case. As I pointed out earlier, legalized abortion merely gives people the right to obtain abortions and reduces the number of illegal abortions that would occur were it not legal. It is not a deliberate and systematic destruction of any group. You can attach all the similarities you can conjure up in your attempt to equate the two. Each one of these similarities is simply another red hat that does NOT necessarily make John a Commie. You do remember that logical falacy, don't you? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Let's do this step by step. The law is systematic, right?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>... to which I might ask, " Which one? " There's no sense in playing sentence tag with you. Just lay out your entire argument in a string of sentences... using definitions printed in Webster's or equivalent English dictionary, not your personal interpretations of definitions. Write as if you are trying to convince the King by way of letter that arbortion = genocide and should be stopped. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>So you dispute law is systematic?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Apparently, you have difficulties understanding English. I said there will be no ' one-sentence-sparring '... and nothing that I have said justifies your conclusion that I might dispute your initial, rhetorical question. Make your entire case in a paragraph or so. Try to keep it below a thousand words. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I will make my case, on a level you will understand, obviously any other level is beyond you. Now lets do this step by step. Do you agree or disagree that " Law " is systematic?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>You are not worth the effort. I'm guessing now you will claim to have won whatever argument it is that you can't seem to put together. So be it. I have better things to do with my time. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>I agree, you would be wasting your time.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It is too bad that you feel the need to concede.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Refusing to debate with you is not conceding. No wonder you think women get themselves pregnant. You live by the double standard. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>In my opinion it is.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Your lack of willingness to answer a straight question seems to indicate a lack of willingness to debate and therefor you conceded first. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I asked the question first : What or how do I force women to carry their pregnancies to term? What do I actively do to force them? I have not had this answered. I win.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It wasn't asked of me. Nor am I convinced this is the first question - but I will answer. You actually can't. You would like to try. For removing the possibility of them terminating a pregnancy if they choose is by default forcing them to go through with it. However - you really can't do this. Even if illegal - women will seek and obtain abortions. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I did ask the question first, just read the thread for proof. Thank you. So you agree that I do not force anything.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Funny but I thought we had to reserve the rights of the MOTHER too....<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You have trouble saying it??? you promote the........ right to kill her baby. lets not be shy... because that is what it is. And that... is not a right, and is more like a legalized crime against nature. - Mosheh Thezion <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Mosheh did you not read anything on my previous posts on Abortion? I said under certain circumstances abortion should be considered. It is not as cut and dry as " Kill her baby " because of the development of the fetus. I said abortion is not a get out of jail free card, and the mother has her rights since she is the one responsible for the child she is carrying.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>ok... yes I read it. And yes the mother is responsible. so, why do we get upset when the mother dumps a new born in the trash? And yes, even i would agree, that under extreme cases, abortion may save the life of the mother. the problem is.. the set up... of making it available.. does not limit it to those mothers in danger. in fact.. they want to put planned parenthood in schools. do you support that? - Mosheh Thezion <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Mosheh your really trying to blur the issue here. The reason we look down upon throwing a child in the trash is because it is ALREADY BORN. It is not a fetus, and is past the third trimester, therefore it is a living breathing person. And Mosheh like I said earlier those considering an abortion must do so with extreme caution and clear thinking. Also Mosheh I have not heard on them putting a non profit organization in a school? What will they do there? Provide on campus aborting? Please... If anything they will provide sex education on practicing safe sex, abstinence, STD " s, and AIDS education. Something that under the Bush years was neglected and has seen teen pregnancy DOUBLE in eight years..<br><b> S2:3-  </b>it is not well covered by liberal media. Yes.. planned parenthood in school.. will do all those things.. and with it.. will offer easy access to off campus abortions. and so... let me ask you... a child maybe born via c-section... long before natural birth. I.e.. a child can be born early.. by c-section. so... if that child is viable... via c-section, it must be considered independant. And so... even though it is still in the womb, it is still viable, even though you claim it is a fetus... do you see... octomom.. had all her kids early.. premies... by your definition... everyone one of her 8 kids.. could of been killed, because they had not yet been naturally born. but.. they were viable... and are alive today. do you see.... just because the baby is still in the womb, does not change the fact that it is a viable baby. I say all abortions after 3 months, should be outlawed., and all abortions regardless should cause a man to do jail time. what say you? - Mosheh Thezion <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I say your measures are extreme and only show certain cases of extremity. There are enough laws on the books for regulating abortions. However, I do think that as in all subjects especially ones regarding sex or pregnancy or the like, need to be educated upon in a non biased factual manner. Free from bias of any kind. People need to make informed choices about what they do with their bodies without feeling judgment or scorn with be passed upon them.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>... So basically your God makes girls sick from the age of two? At that point, I was going to church, and in foster care and very sick with asthma and my ear infections. My later adoptive parents had no idea what was sick until they ran a battery of breathing tests since I would turn blue and need to be rushed to the hospital. That was also when I was basically deaf from fluid in my ears. I would have constant ear infections and they were so painful I would scream and bang my head against the wall. So your kind and just God makes it okay for you to insult my beliefs? I don't have the beliefs you do, and I don't insult you. I believe that makes me more mature and open minded and oh my, I don't have a religion.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>so after all you've suffered... And the trama... All the pain... would you prefer to be dead? would you say it would be better for your mother to have killed you? Can you say that your life, is not worth living? There may be challenges.. to be sure.. but there are good times also. Are not those few good times worth living? Is it not worth the pain, and suffering in exchange for being alive? eh??? And can you honestly say... it would be better to kill... literally.. kill your baby rather than TAKE A CHANCE... that they will suffer hardship? if s o.. should all people in poor nations kill their babies? because they will grow up poor and mal-nurished? Is potential suffering... a justifyable cause for killing our babies? honestly..? Should the state kill you, because your not perfect? eh? - Mosheh Thezion <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Once again, you're taking it to far, and I didn't even mention abortion in my post.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>this entire thread is about abortion. And you said you would kill your baby so it wont have ashma like you. Would that be fair? to deny it life, just because it MAY suffer in life? Does it not deserve those few good times, just like you have enjoyed? - Mosheh Thezion <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I'm not going to argue with you. I will be having heart attacks in the next few years. I doubt I'll live to thirty, where would that leave my hypothetical child?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>it would leave it alive, which is better than dead, to be adopted and to live a life. Thats all. oh.. and it is possible to survive a heart attack, by couphing really hard... as the act of coughing.. will push blood through your body and brain.. and allow you to stay awake long enough for you to dial 911... or get some kind of help... minutes count.... and it can keep you alive and give you a better chance. Maybe enough time to use a defibrilator.. i would buy one. - Mosheh Thezion<br><b>S1:1-  </b>OK I get the setup. My mind won't be corrupted with atheistic liberal propaganda. That's where I have my stance on doctrinal purity.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Eh? How are women exploited? They have the choice of getting an abortion, that's the point. lol! Our heathen, secular logic? ;) <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Women are never given options in these clinics, they are told that abortion is their only option, that it must be done as quickly as possible to prevent the woman from changing her mind. That's just how the abortion industry makes its lucrative business. Crisis pregnancy centers, on the other hand, help both the woman and the child by housing feeding, clothing, counselling, proper medical care, counselling, and ministring. The abortuaries can't, nor won't do all of that. Yeah, your signature is befitting.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Truly? Where is your evidence of this? In my experience, talking to many women who have had abortions, they had their mind made up before they went to the clinic. Lucrative? Only if it's a private practice. I know that PP, in particular, has sliding pay scales so that girls who cannot pay much do not have to pay much. Tell me, would you be equally appalled at an organization that didn't give abortion as an option, and told the girl that carrying the fetus is her only option, and lies to keep her convinced? Truly? How so? Because I'm always right? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>That's exactly what the abortion mills do. www.abortionfacts.com Because liberalism defies logic<br><b> S2:3-  </b>As Jitobear and Wez pointed out, you didn't actually answer my questions. Abortionfacts has no credibility, get an objective source or don't bother. Truly? How so?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>This sort of attitude being one of the reasons I have become more pro-choice.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You should make opinions basedon God, not the way other people act. People can be right and still have annoying attitude. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Why should I base my opinion upon your chosen deity? What a truly moronic suggestion.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Because my God is the only true god and any other god is a lie. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Again this is simply your opinion.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It's God's opinion too. I'm still waiting for Master _ Shake and simone to tell me if the board has changed their opinions. I'm sure there are more people reading, and I'd like to hear about their opinions too.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Of course it was two dimensional. I did it on purpose. I was responding to JPs equally ridiculous two dimension knee-jerk comment. You are full of them, too. You can barely see past your stupid rhetoric to comprehend the pro-choice side, even if you don't agree with it. Don't like demonizing emotionally charged statements when used against your point of view? It's equally annoying on this side of the fence.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I can see that you're ability to divorce personalities from your argument is still eduding you. Some things never change, I guess. :p <br><b>S1:2-  </b>What are you talking about?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>\ Are you kidding? You don't know what you wrote two posts ago? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yes I know what I posted. I am not following your response to it. You made a stupid two-dimensional, black and white comment " pro ripping fetus vs anti-ripping fetus " so I made a similar one " see women as people vs brood mares ", Bassman chided me for my comment, so I told him I made the comment because you did the same thing. You accuse liberals of rhetoric from the ' pro-choice handbook ' when you do the same thing. I was simply calling the pot black.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>My comment was directed at your personal attacking style of writing, not the substance of what you wrote. Comments such as " stupid " and " ridiculous " don't advance your position, they only degrade the debate by introducing personal attacks into it.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Like I said, the biggest difference comes with partial birth abortion. From your site :<br><b> S2:1-  </b>' Partial birth abortion ' or no, the majority of the country does not agree with late-term abortions. Given that 90 some-odd percent of abortions happen in the first two trimesters ( and 88% in the first ), this is hardly a problem. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>While you may not see a problem with the murder of viable fetuses, I sure as Hell do.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Eh? I'm not sure how you could have gotten that out of what I said. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Sorry if I misunderstood this post : but, to me, it said since 90% of abortions occur in the first 2 trimesters, you can live with the 10% that are late-term.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>We were speaking of who is pro-choice and who is pro-life. While most of the country disagrees with late-term abortion, most of the country also supports early abortion. Since less than 10% of abortions are late-term, the fact that the majority of people disagree with late-term abortions is not a conflict with being pro-choice. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So, in other words, most people's positions are based on pragmatism not principle?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I don't think what I wrote can be interpreted in that way. I am saying that one can hold the political stance of being pro-choice and disagree with late-term abortions. How is this pragmatism? Why disagree with late-term abortions if not on principle? In fact, why would you consider supporting early-term abortions pragmatic? I, for example, support it on a matter of principle. Certainly some are pro-choice simply because it is pragmatic, but I am willing to bet some are pro-life for the same reason.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What care is necessary for a fetus in the womb other than the woman eating and not over-exerting herself? That's like saying a woman shouldn't have to care for her big toe if she doesn't want to.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>OOooooooooooooh boy! Only a man could say that. You are totally clueless about pregnancy and possible compllications. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Oh brother, another " walk a mile in my shoes " advocate. And only a self-righteous woman would argue that every one of the billions of births of humans since the beginning of time were replete with danger. Statistically speaking, you have a higher chance of death while driving at night than giving birth.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Pray from what statistics in what universe did you draw this conclusion? <br><b>S1:3-  </b># of traffic deaths in 2000 = 41,611 You have ~ 1% chance of dying in a car accident in your lifetime. Maternal mortality rate 5.1 / 100,000 births. Unless you have 20,000 kids, you're chance of dying in a car accident are, therefore, greater.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>What are your sources for these stats?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I disagree that certain definition implies mental existence. You determine this by taking a biology class Yeah, I'd say it implies more of a full development than " mental existence ". No we are not weighing that... I made the question not you. We are weighing the moral value of a human over a cat. What makes the human have more value than a cat.... what about a monkey that has more " intelligence " than some humans? You seem to just not want to answer!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What the heck is " certain definition "? Do you agree or disagree that the definition I quoted implies a mental existence? Oh? Are you trying to tell me that the dictionary definition cannot tell us what it is to be human?! You can't be serious! The dictionary definition knows all and tells all! You must be wrong. So what is the criteria, then? What makes us ' a human ' as opposed to ' human '. Oh, so only fully developed... things... are human if they fit that criteria? What are they before they are fully developed? This question is off-topic, then. Make a new thread about what makes humans of more moral worth than animals to various posters. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Disagree. I stated that. The " certain definition " was the one you quoted. Are you suggesting the dictionary is meaningless? If you want to try and define every word in every definition then you could come to the conclusion that nothing is defined. You asked questions that were not related to definition as it assumes some level of knowledge ( ie not questioning every word in the definition ). The criteria for the word human is set up in the dictionary as that is what they are there for. I don't claim you have to put any moral significance on this. I said the definition you selectivily chose implies a fully developed body. This contradicts the other 5 definitions in the same link you gave me so I reject the definition you gave. It beats me what dictionary.com ( the source of that definition ) thinks 2 yr olds are. It is right on topic. Why can't you answer? The discussion we were having was about consciousness and that being the deciding factor for moral value. I said that my cat has consciousness and then you said my cat was not human. My question is why should " human " matter?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I see. On what basis do you disagree that dependence upon language and the creation and utilization of complex tools implies a mental existence? I see. You are then claiming the dictionary does not provide a criteria for being human, and instead assumes we know this criteria? What is the criteria then, according to Steve? Contradicts in what way? I see no contradiction. The other definitions provide no criteria, while the one I quoted did. Yet it is unacceptable to you for some reason you have not supplied. The deciding factor for moral value... in humans. Whether it applies to non-human animals or not would be the subject for another thread. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>That is more developmental than mental existence. You could certainly have mental existence and not have language or utilization of complex tools. Actually I am claiming the dictionary defines human. How scientific classification works is not the purpose of the dictionary. Seems you are claiming the dictionary can't tell us anything. I don't even know what you are typing to me! Well, ignoring the fact that you chose " homo sapiens " as opposed to one homo sapien ( a group instead of individual ) the other 4 or 5 definitions provide a definition. You seem to want the dictionary to be more than it is... I can't help you there. The only point I make is that a human embryo qualifies under the definition of human or human being. Obviously those two nouns describe something and an embryo is part of what they describe. So you don't want to answer or what? I made the question... you refuse to answer eventhough I have answered all your questions. Very classy.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes. Scientific classification is not the purpose of the dictionary. The dictionary's sole purpose is recording how people generally use terms. It has no objective validity and no use beyond informing us how people generally use terms. The only way this has any validity in this debate is if the question is : " What is the dictionary definition ". The dictionary has no use in this debate beyond that. That is not the question here. The question here is : " Does the fetus qualify conceptually under the philosophical umbrella of ' human being ' or ' person '? " That is a question the dictionary can never answer. I've never considered it important to this debate. If you wish to discuss this, I'd be happy to contribute in a new thread. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>and no one claimed otherwise. That is not the question. Philosophy doesn't define terms. The questions is " Does the fetus qualify as morally valuable ". The fact that the fetus is a human is rather irrelevant but don't go around saying " it isn't a human therefore ok " because 1 ) it in fact is a human and 2 ) this doesn't prove or disprove anything. I feel it is very important as I don't say which characteristics are important to give it moral value I just say being a human gives you moral value in and of its self. I'll consider starting a new thread since you feel it is irrelevant to this one ( although I disagree with this )<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Then you really cannot claim the dictionary tells us who is or is not human, because the dictionary does not determine ones species. If you wish to claim the dictionary can tell us the criteria for being human then you would have to tell me on what basis you contend that dependence upon language and the creation and utilization of complex tools does not imply a mental existence. We define terms for use in philosophy. And that is indeed the question since it is assumed that those who qualify as a ' person ' or ' human being ' is worthy of moral consideration. But is is philosophically human? What does it mean to be human? That is a question the dictionary cannot answer. Hell, the dictionary cannot even tell us whether it is scientifically human. Your original statement was that mental existence made your cat human. Mental existence may give your cat moral value, but it cannot make it human. However, we are only discussing the moral value in humans. Your point here is off-topic. I cannot see any point in this one.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I like how you just claim a person is " sexist " and go to petty insults just because a person doesn't support abortion. Nevermind the fact that you have no basis for these assumptions, you just want to demean the other person... Perhaps you would like it if I called you a sexist or maybe a rapist lover? I have the same backing you for your claims. Anyway, you are getting really close to just slander ( forbidden by the forum admin ), I suggest all three of you calm it down as we have had many banned on here for the very tactics you use.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Sorry, but I called him sexist because of his attitude toward women as shown in his post. As a women, I felt that his comments were rather demeaning and sexist. I don't call anyone anything unless it has a basis in what they have said or done. And about getting banned, lol! I'm calling it as I see it and I'm not afraid of your petty threats. Oh, and by the way, since you seem so obsessed with the dictionary, here you go : There is nothing false about my statement, therefore it is not slander. Slander is what Bush's buddies did to McCain in the Republican primaries ( I think it was the primaries - whatever it is where republicans choose their candidate for president out of a group of republicans ). <br><b>S1:2-  </b>So if I called you a child molesting rapist because I thought you were then you would be ok with this? It wasn't a threat... I don't ban people... I'm just saying that many folks have been.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I'd be fine with it... If I said anything in my posts which suggested it, which I have not. ( Not to mention the fact that females as " child molesting rapists " are rather rare and unusual ) You see, with his post, it pretty much showed a sexist attitude, hence why I said that I bet ( key word here ) he was one of those sexists who blamed the victim for the rape ( something frighteningly common from people who live near me ). Um, that's why I said you don't scare me with your petty litte threats, as I know you cannot ban me as you are not a moderator. I'll let the moderators tell me if I've gone to far, and then I will abide by their decision, not yours. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I guess we just have a different set of morals. Accusing someone of the things you did or me calling you a " child molesting rapist " is wrong.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It's not wrong if it's true, based on the evidence ( of which you would have none to call me that ). If I were to call someone who has killed children a " child-murderer ", is that wrong? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>what is this " evidence "? The fact that he doesn't think a rape victim should get an abortion? I'd like to see that one in a court case.. HA<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No one, I repeat no one wants to take punitive actions against any woman unless you call carrying the baby to term punitive action......... All we want is for the baby in the womb to have the same chance you did if possible...........<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So if Jitobear's mother had the option to abort Jitobear in utero, you want Jitobear to have the same option with any children she carries? That's awfully progressive of you. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Nice try but your play on words does not work.......... You know exactly what I meant........<br><b> S2:2-  </b>In fact I believe you said : If you want babies in the womb to have the same chance that we did, and you're asking for them to have the same chance that we did, then you must have known that such a chance included the risk of abortion in many cases. If you want us to understand you, I think it might help if you're more careful with how you express you opinion. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not prior to 1972 when the states had jurisdiction on abortion......... What a staggering figure 40,000,000 is since it has been made easy to have and abortion at the drop of a hat.....<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Surprisingly some people were born after 1972 and some other people aren't even American and come from places with a different history of abortion laws. So what you really meant to say was that babies in the womb should get the same chance that babies born prior to 1972 in the US did? Does that mean they should have the same risk of illegal abortions then? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Abortions were state issues prior to the federal government sticking their nose in.......... I would go out and a limb and say there were not 40,000,000 abortions performed from 1900 to 1972 then when all you had to do was say, " I forgot to use birth control when I had sex so I want to use abortion as my birth control. "<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Pardon me, but what does that have to do with babies in the womb getting the same chance at life as the rest of us whose mothers may or may not have had access to abortion, either because we were born in the USA prior to 1972, or because we were not born in the USA at all? Doesn't anyone else know what Voice of Reason is trying to say here? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>No, it was a different era......... Families had values........... Women carried their babies to term............ People respected life unlike today........<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Would you please answer my question directly?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>To abort because of an identified significant malformation is perfectly reasonable to me. My wife and I discussed this early in her pregnancy since we we're told that our chances of a serious genetic abnormality was 1 in 74. Long odds on a horse but seemed a real possibility at the time. We were in complete agreement to abort in the worst case scenario.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Because of course,... people with genetic malady's have no right to their lives anyway. Right? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>People have rights, mindless fetuses do not.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I contend that humans who are in the fetal stage of their life DO have a right to live the life they are already in the act of " living. " Whether or not they are mindless ( however temporary as it may be ) is irrelevant to their rights,... as No where can it bo found in our Constitution that our rbasic rights are contingent upon whether or not we can ( or ever will ) think, feel pain or walk or talk. You may be able to sell your fallacious banter to some. But you won't sell it to me. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>There is no " they ", no " I " if there is no mind. " Cogito, ergo sum ". Our basic rights only apply to persons. You've yet to demonstrate that a fertilized ovum is a person for all intents and purposes. Claiming something fallacious is easy. Actually showing something to be fallacious you seem unwilling to do.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I challenge you to " demonstrate " your own personhood... to anyone as hell bent as you are on denying it. There is plenty of evidence to base the conclusion upon that a human being's ( a person's ) life biologically begins at the moment of their conception. Then there is the fact that the Constitution protects all persons equally, mindless, handicapped, inconvienient to others,... etc. The Constitution recognizes persons as they are biologically human individual beings. All the metaphysical #### about " souls " or intelligence etc. is a bunch of hooey. Because the ONLY requirment for personhood is that a " person " be a " human being. " It's funny how some who claim to be for the seperation of church and state demand that " personhood " be based upon the " metaphysical " rather than the biological. Biologically, the logic goes like this ; 1 : A human fetus is an individual human being. 2 : Individual Human Beings are Persons. 3 : A human fetus is a " person. " I'm sure that's how it looks from your perspective. Nothing I can do about that though. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Responding to you should suffice. Done. Now you demonstrate that a fertilized ovum is a person like me. Not all biology is sentient. Human beings ( people ) are. It's not a " being " unless it's sentient. Elementary really. Your convoluted language is as transparent as when you arrived. Do you suppose there'll come a time when you need to expand your definition of person to five or six words to make your disingenuous argument? Ha! Which you haven't shown fetuses to be. You just keep repeating it as if it were established. " Personhood " is a metaphysical concept that requires biological structures to even be possible. Not all. Beings are sentient Agreed. see above. Then admit you can't prove your case and therefore have no right to make others adhere to your " beliefs ".<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Margaret Sanger was also a racist and supporter of the Eugenics movement of the 1930's<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I'd have to read an authoritative source on the racist issue as she was known for her involvement in the Southern US helping minorities understand female hygiene and birth control. The US was so far regressed on birth control it was actually illegal in some US states until the 1950 / 60 s. Bassman, it sounds like you're in favor of keeping the poor ignorant and removed from birth control to encourage spawning of cheap labor cycles? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>What I'm in favor of is repairing the damage to the morality of this coutry that Sanger, Steinem, Ginsburg, Clinton ( both of them ) and others on the Left have caused : 1 ) The so-called " sexual revolution " that left a huge trail of illegitimacy and devestation. - AND - 2 ) The wholesale slaughter of unborn children to the tune of 1.5 million every year.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Your definitions of morality. Where is Sanger's racism documented? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>www.blackgenocide.org/sanger.html<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're kidding, right? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>No, I'm not!<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Jessica, http://prolifeamerica.com/4D-Ultrasound-pictures/<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Wow. You walked right into that one didn't you? your argument seems to be " It looks like a person, so it is a person ". This means of course that this man http://phreeque.tripod.com/joseph_merrick.html was not a person, a woman with external physical deformities is not person, a severe burns victims is not a person and so on. It of course also means that by * your argument* a fertilised egg is not a person because it sure as heck doesn't look like one. Yes, how DARE I expect people to use unbiased material in a debate! I have no problem with you using biased sites if it is linked back to an original ubiased source - which this is not. It doesn't even say if these photos are gestational or pregnancy age and indeed most photos are unlabelled and some are clearly mislabelled, it misrepresents movements ( implying they are controlled and more than reflexes ), most of the photos are later on in the pregnancy when 90% of abortions take place in the first trimester etc etc etc. It is full of the usual pro-life lies and misrepresentations that I have sadly come to expect from pro-life sites. Please don't insult both of us by using such unreliable propoganda sites. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>My argument is not " It looks like a person, so it is a person. " It is more like it usually is a person when it looks like a person. I ask you what it is if it isn't a person. For me to say that the pictures supplied are persons does nothing to disparage a person whose physical or mental characteristics are not perfect. I do not advocate aborting those who may be deformed or retarded in growth or mental development. I believe they are persons too. You likened my presentation of babies in the womb to imaginary chimpanzees. I asked if I showed you a human being in the womb if you would believe one was in there. And I have done that. And I tell you that you can find these photos in a medical clinic or in a strip mall. I have supplied this site out of convenience for time. Are you denying that a medical ultrasound does not show the physical features of babies in the womb?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It's a zef. What was the point of you posting these pictures if you're not arguing that they're people cos they look like it? Nothing. Hey Max : what is this if it's not a person http://ashtondrake.collectiblestoday...-319349001.jsp Why it's a beautiful baby girl!! And what about abnormalities incompatible with life? Severe disabilities? no, you've shown a picture of a fetus and you've done absolutely NOTHING to prove it's anything other than that. No, they do of course show the physical features of zefs. And where have I said otherwise? That's right : nowhere. You cannot use biased sites for medical info, because they lie. These pictures are not labelled properly, are misleading and the site is ridden with lies. I'm not doubting the truth of 4D ultrasound pictures, I'm doubting the lying labels the AntiAbortionPropogandaIndustry ( AAPI ) put beside them. I know you want to believe all the lies these sites spew out Max, but you can't - they are unreliable, and you shouldn't trust anything they say. Next time, get any pictures or info you want from a medical site. That's medical, not political. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Jessica, Congratulations, this takes you to new heights in your display of debating skills. Could you be more specific? Would these do? http://www.ultrasoundbabies.com/ http://www.ob-ultrasound.net/joewoo3d.html http://www.gehealthcare.com/usen/ult...d/thennow.html You're one of the few pro-choicers I know that hasn't progressed past the " lump of tissue " argument. Most are sentient enough to realize that there is more to it than that.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Huh? I'm using YOUR argument. " If it looks like a person, it usually is a person ". This looks exactly like a person, therefore probably is a person. It's clearly your skills that are lacking Max. Would you like to admit the pictures are nonsense so we can move on? Such as some of the trisomy conditions for example. There, much better. Not quite medical sites, but a great improvement. Ahhh, you think sentience is important - you KNOW zefs don't have this in the time frame abortion is legal, right? and no pl " evidence " here about brainwaves etc please because I will laugh at you, although in a kind and gentle manner. It is a lump of tissue in the early stages ( knew you'd like that one :) ). Tissue with potential, but potential NEVER outweighs actual.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I'd certainly question their moral arguments. With Bell then telephone is a different matter. You are right to say you can't judge a person based on other actions but you can certainly judge related actions... Sanger was for eugenics which puts her motives in morals into question. I still maintain she has a complete consistent pro-choice stance.... so I don't know why you don't embrace her beliefs.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Because you don't get to define someone else's beliefs. I know it would be convenient for you to believe that those who are pro-choice also support eugenics for then it would be easier to smear. But the fact remains that despite her wrong and misguided views on eugenics - she was RIGHT about reproductive rights, birth control, family planning and women's health. I certainly don't want a return to my grandmother's world - 11 kids in a one room shack to an abusive husband who wouldn't work with no access to birth control or the possibility of telling him no. Sanger did a GREAT thing. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I was just saying it was a consistent argument. Is this the " even a broken clock is right twice a day " argument? she ended having 11 kids in a one room shack with an abusive husband who wouldn't work? I don't think so. once again, her moral values bring her other moral judgments into question.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>One does not have to belive B to belive A. You make that claim every time you say that not all lifers are religious. No. When it came to women having access to birth control, decent reproductive health care and the option not having children at all - she was 100% correct. Pardon me? Are you calling me a liar? Jim, John, Mike, Tom, Dan, Pat, Pris, Linda, Carol, Tess, and Nan ( MY MOM ). They lived in a one room shack in Duluth, MN and my grandpa was a crazy, abusive schmuck who would not work. Every time my grandmother tried to get birth control she was refused and spousal rape did not exist ( still doesn't in some states ). Hell, my mom couldn't get her tubes tied without my dad's permission, which he would not grant until my mom's doctor lied to him about my mom's ability to maintain another pregnancy. This was in the 1970 s. This same man who was granted control of my mother's reproductive rights walked out on the three kids he had with her ten years later. But not the fact that how she revolutionized womens health was a good thing. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Try but if the logic A is the same for B then naturally you would come to the same conclusion for A and B. My point is that she had a consistent belief. There are many reasons for pro-choice but logic presented by Simone at the time led me to believe she would have to have the same conclusion. ok? I certainly wouldn't call her a noble person. No, i'm not calling you a liar... I'm saying you are wrong. I don't think Sanger helped with those things you spoke of. Her theory behind is what I have a problem with.... of course her line of thinking would lead to things like eugenics and abortion.... it is the only consistent conclusion she could come to!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well you are wrong as neither Simone or myself believe in eugenics. I didn't know her. But she did a good thing. Are you nuts? You don't think helping ensure that women have access to health care, birth control and the right to decide for themselves impacted the fact that my grandmother couldn't get birth control without a man's permission, my mother could not get her tubes tied without a man's permission yet I can and have done both. Steve - despite what you think you are dead wrong. She started a health and social revolution that in this day and age has allowed me, a woman, to make decisions about motherhood MYSELF. That's huge. There are reasons for abortion beyone eugenics. Did you read what I wrote about my grandmother and mother? There is nothing wrong with motherhood. If one chooses to be a mother. There was a time where it was not a choice. Especially for married women. At least it wasn't their choice. Womens lives have worth regarldess of whether or not they are mothers. They always did. It has just taken some time to convince some men of that. In parts of this world ( including the Vatican ) we have yet to do so. Their lives have worth period. Ones life is even more precious when in control of it.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>If you're going to repeat your opinion ad nauseum, could you please include your reasons for holding that opinion? I'm sure you can manage the copy-paste function easily enough.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I would rather type it and I do it for people like Hydra who is new here......... I know the truth bothers you so you can just skip over it.............. Thanks....... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I'm just asking for you to explain the ' truth ' to me so that I can agree with you. Is that so much to ask?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I don't know how to explain it to you any better, now focus like a laser beam and pay attention because here is the truth as I believe it when it comes to the subject of abortion.......... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Okay, I think you're misunderstanding me here. I know you think that : What I'm asking is why you think that this is true. I'm asking for your justification for holding such a position. What convinces you that this is true?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>My justification is I believe that life begins at conception therefore if you have and abortion then you are murdering a baby in the womb...........<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I have said this before but I will say it again for the new people to the forum and I believe it with my whole heart and soul........ Abortion is killing a defenseless, helpless, innocent baby in the womb.... It is the most barbaric crime one human being can perpetrate on another and should not be allowed except in extreme cases where the life of the mother is endangered or possibly in cases of rape and incest...........<br><b> S2:1-  </b>the question is, would you rather the mother go through the full term pregnancy and delivery ( and all that comes with it like weight gain, loss of wages, emotional trauma, etc ) and then give the child away? ( and i'm not talking about the rare cases of rape, incest or medical complications, i'm talking about the majority reason that the mother simply doesnt want the child ) <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I guess she should of thought of that before she became pregnant............... Using abortion as birth control is the most horible reason of all..........<br><b> S2:2-  </b>what exactly is the difference between birth control ( condoms, the pill, etc ) and abortion? in both cases the life of a human is terminated before it can even start <br><b>S1:3-  </b>A condom might prevent a life from beginning and abortion murders a life after it has been conceived...........<br><b> S2:3-  </b>and...? neither gets out of the womb alive. condoms kill more babies than abortion clinics if you ask me. is preventing a life from being born a bad thing? think of the great men and women those sperms killed in the tip of the condom could have grown up to become...<br><b>S1:1-  </b>For the same reason you can'tlegally or morally undo ( kill ) another person regardless of age.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Where on earth did you get this idea? You have drawn a distinction between that which is moral and that which is legal and in doing so acknowledged the possibility of there existing an unjust law. Just because abortion may be legal does not mean it is moral. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Did I need to stipulate without just cause or license? My bad. Do you deny the possibility an unjust law?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I mean where did you get the idea that murder is immoral. We all know it is illegal. No, do you? The only way there can be an unjust law is if there is an absolute morality. The only way there can be an absolute morality is if there is a God. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I heard it somewhere and since I don't like the idea of being murdered myself I decided to play along. Duh! I don't see it that way at all. Unjust is not an absolute, it's a judgement. I believe in neither.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>This is personal preference, not morality. No, the term unjust assumes the term just. Just assumes an absolute right and wrong or else the word has absolutely no meaning. Then you cant say there is such a thing as an unjust law. And you cant say with any authority that murder is always wrong. You can only make observations and meaningless judgments. No wonder you are confused about abortion.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You do the same, if you don't donate every spare minute and dollar above what you need to keep yourself alive to extending the lives of others. Your participation on this forum indicates that you place your own preferences above the lives of others. Why aren't you out patrolling a beach, earning money to send to Africa, or caring for the homeless? You pretty much put your own happiness over someone elses life, you despicable monster.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>If you are resorting to an absolute arguement like this then you have already lost. You suggest an all or nothing idea of thinking. Not only that, we have been through this a number of times on this forum and have shown how the arguement you use is invalid. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Ah, of course, the fallacy of the absolute argument, how could I have forgotten. This is reality - you, on a regular basis, put your personal happiness over other peoples ' lives. And yet if someone else says they do the same, you presume you have some sort of moral superiority to them. Please, enlighten me. Your argument is essentially " putting your personal happiness over other peoples ' lives is wrong ", and yet you do it yourself constantly. I see no more reason to enslave others to protect " lives " than I do to enslave you to others ' lives.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Who said anything about fallacies? Actually, you assume this. Moreover, is your own pesonal happieness worth killing someone for... which was the question. No, my arguement is " putting personal happiness about a right to life is wrong " and I don't do constantly.... however, abortion does. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>African children have a right to life and you are violating it by not providing them with clean food, water, and medicine to the full extent of your abilities. You are here posting on this forum, that is proof.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Good grief... we have been through this so many times. This doesn't hold up. With your logic we could conclude that you are violating every right I have at this very moment... this is obviously not true. Who's to say I am not trying to save lives by posting on the forums? I see you did a nice job of selective quoting too... Lets actually look at my whole post...<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It goes without saying that abortion is more than just the simple withholding of one's support from the developing fetus ; it is the active removal of the fetus from it's natural environment using a procedure intended to bring about it's death. Why can we perform a certain action ( i.e. termination of life ) on a fetus, but not on a birthed child? If she has the right to remove her support from the child at any stage, then she has the right to withold nutrition and hydration from her 1 week old baby. If you are in support of the mother having the right to remove her support from the child at any stage, then you wouldn't mind if she starved her child to death, correct?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>True, no point in forcing the child to endure a long lingering death once it is removed from the mother's body. Personally I think it would be wonderful if we were able to simply remove the fetus from the mother's body and put it in an artificial womb until it could survive on its own. But if the fetus cannot survive being removed from its mother's body, quick disposal seems to be the next best option. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You know, newborn babies can't survive without the aid of another agent. If such an agent can't be found who will volunteer to care for the child, there is no point in forcing the child to endure a long lingering death. If the child can't survive without the aid of another agent, quick disposal seems to be the next best option, right?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Without the possibility of the child receiving aid from anyone, then it seems preferable to euthanize the child rather than let it starve to death, yes. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It seems more preferable to me to force someone to care for the child than to euthanize it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Oh, why? Moreover, what kind of force is permissable? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Because it is reasonable to ask / force somone to care for a child when you would rather see it euthanized. Moreover, the kind of force that is permissable is the same kind that removes my tax dollars from me in order to fund a welfare system ; or that removes my tax dollars from me in order to support pro-abortion organizations.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I don't quite follow you here. Could you rephrase or explain this? So the threat of imprisonment? Considering the number of people who don't report all of their owed taxes, that seems like a pretty weak threat to me. Besides, I don't pay taxes because someone forces me to but because I want to contribute to the Canadian gov't. :) <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Because [ I think ] it is reasonable to ask / force someone to care for a child [ in cases where Nurglitch ] would rather see it euthanized. I don't understand your point here. And even if you didn't want to contribute to the Canadian government, you could still be forced to do so :p.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Ah, okay. My question still stands then. Why do you think it is reasonable to force someone to care for a child when no one is willing to? My point is that the mere threat of imprisonment seems pretty weak in a situation where you have to force someone to look after a child. Despite laws against child neglect, children are still neglected. Also, it seems to me that the situation has to be pretty harsh before you run out of people willing and able to look after an additional child. I take it you've never studied Canadian tax law then. If you're unwillingly paying taxes to the Canadian gov't, then you either need a new accountant or need to study up on the law. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I think it is reasonable to ask someone to give up one cup of coffee, gourmet dinner, ice cream cone etc. a month ( in order to pay a tax, for example ) in order to preserve the life of the child. I attribute inherent dignity to the human person, and thus when one person's right to life conflicts with another persons quality of life, I think that quality of life must win. Despite laws against murder, people still murder. This stops no one from making laws against murder. Please explain...<br><b>S1:1-  </b>its a baby, a human, a life. it doesnt matter what its called, the sentiment remains the same. most women have abortions because they dont want to have a baby. they have sex and dont want to get pregnant, but end up getting pregnant anyway. so they abort the baby. the result is the same as if they had sex and didnt get pregnant. abortion is like an " undo " button. people make mistakes, people do dumb stuff. i dont think there is a single woman in the world that enjoys having abortions. like i said before, abortions are not fun events. they are not pleasureable and they are not something to look forward to. but if youre having sex for pleasure, and you dont want to get prengant, you use contraceptives. if you dont use contraceptives and get pregnant, you have an abortion at the end of the day the result is identical : a night of pleasureable sex, no pregnancy. what is the difference?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>One you murder one you dont.... this is pretty obvious. How would you feel if we thought you were a mistake and wished to hit the " undo " button. You are ok with us just takin you out? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>if it was me i would have no opinion or feeling about it. how would you feel if you were never were even concieved because the condom cut you off before you even had a chance to be a mistake?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If you killed someone sleeping they would never know either, unkerpaulie, however I wouldn't call this ok. I would feel betrayed. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>therefore, there is essentially no effective difference between abortion and contraception when it comes to preventing people from being born. 2 differnt methods of achieving the same results<br><b> S2:3-  </b>except one is killing someone... like i said. Unless you are ok with killing people then you really make no sense <br><b>S1:4-  </b>i guess you are ok with preventing people from ever having life at all<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Like VOR said.... conception would be when they are a person whether you look at DNA or just common sense. Even if you wanna do the " lookign test " at a few weeks it looks like a very small human... very small. So what is your point exactly? ( and I don't mean to be sounding like a jerk I just wanna know what your point is ) <br><b>S1:5-  </b>i think the point is that the line between getting accidentally pregnant and not getting accidentally pregnant is very thin. the root of the problem is not freedom and rights as much as it is having sex with little discretion. if a person has sex and doesnt get pregnant, they are doing the exact same thing as the pers on that has sex and does become pregnant. when you have sex and you dont want to become pregnant, you wear contraceptive, or what ever type of birth control you can. sometimes the birth control method fails, and you accidentally become pregnant anyway. the original intention was to have sex and not get pregnant. in such a case, abortion fixes the situation where the birth control method failed. is the problem really abortion? would you rather every unintentional pregnancy to produce another unwanted baby? ( 40,000,000 since 1972? ) would you prefer a more effective form of birth control that could allow sex without accidental pregnancies more often? the only way to reduce the number of abortions is to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies. either more birth control, or less sex, neither of which are viable solutions. so what do you suggest?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I suggest banning abortion as that would cut down the number. If someone has sex with protection they still are accepting all risks involved in this like like you accept all consequences of any action you do. For example, when you cross the street you accept the consequence that you might get hit by a car. This doesn't mean it is ok to get hit by a car or you wanted to get hit by a car, but that you knew the possibility was out there. If you cross the street you have accepted this. Now when you have sex it is the same thing. You realize that you might get pregnant. You accept this. Once you get pregnant you have created a life and have no right to end it even if you didn't want it because you accepted that risk. I don't suppose you are for murdering people are you? Your suggestions are that you fix a problem by murder. Well, does this mean I can kill everyone in my way to " fix " my problems? You then ask would I rather have 40 mill more people here. yes I would. If you value human life then you wouldn't want to kill people like that. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>interesting, because in america if you choke on a chicken bone at kfc and suffer injuries, you can sue kfc, even though you knew there is a risk of choking on a chicken bone whenever you eat chicken. should we also ban law suits so that those risk-taking chicken-eaters should also face the consequences of their actions?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>First off, you can sue for anything. If you choke on a chicken bone you won't win unless KFC told you it was boneless. You CAN'T sue a condom company ( as in being able to win ) if you get pregnant because the label clearly says it is not 100% effective. You are back in Tort law again. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>yes but there are no disclaimers on drumsticks that eating this run you the risk of choking. yes disclaimers protect the companies certain liabilities, but even when consumers are informed of a risk, they still can get recourse if they suffer because of it anyway, yes sex can get you pregnant. thats a risk everybody that has sex takes. still, pregnancy is not what the couple wanted when they had sex. so they have the option of undoing the pregnancy via abortion its like a manufacturing company that makes teddy bears, and unexpectedly produces a stuffed rat instead. that company has the option of getting rid of the unwanted rat, rather than being forced to package and sell it as a teddy bear. yes, the risk of accidentally manufacturing something thats not a teddy bear exists, but why should the company continue to produce these unwanted rats?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>To accept this as a reason that most abortion are not for convenience but instead because most use birth control and it fails most of the time is not worth the time to hunt statistics on. Have it if you want but I doubt you will find statistics to show that birth control fails most of the time or that it is even used by most women seeking abortions. No, you're trying to say I implied it is only her responsibility, and I did not. I simply pointed out that non-rape victims willingly engaged in activity that could result in preganancy when birth control is an available choice. IMO, the woman she either use birth control or make sure the man is using it, the same is true for him. When the two of them decide to romp in the hay for the fun of it with no concern from either for birth control then abortion is simply a convenience for their irresponsible behaviour. At the time of choosing an abortion the choice is entirely hers and if she's getting one because she didn't want to get pregnant then she should have considered that before participating in the first place. Abortion should not be just another convenient form of birth control.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Because you've decided it's morally wrong? What you've chosen to call convenience is much more than that. Decisions affecting the rest of her life as well as those of any children she might ultimately have. To trivialize these indicates you have already placed the fetus equal to her. This is a moral judgement. She would have to share your morality to agree with you. She has no such obligation. Btw " before she spreads her legs " speaks volumes about your respect for women. How about " before he whips it out " instead. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not equal to but certainly more deserving of a chance at life than a common strep infection.....<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Again a moral judgement not shared by all. Deserving indicates consideration due based on rights. One must invest the fetus with rights before that consideration is due. Again just your personal preference. Show me why investing these rights is the only logical viewpoint. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Just because I happen to feel that Samuel was alive when this picture was taken, I realize people like yourself may not believe that though....<br><b> S2:3-  </b>My work computer won't allow me to view pro-life sites. I can guess what your propoganda shows. But alive isn't the question. I accept that the fetus is " alive ". Is it sentient? This is the question to my mind. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You really have to see the picture. A 21 week old fetus is getting an in utero operation for spina bifida. In the picture it has stuck it's hand out of the womb and clasped the surgeons finger.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Yes, but in the end it is only the woman's reproductive organs you wish to legislate.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You made the statement I just proved that your statement was inaccurate. I can list several laws that legislate against male sex organs, including flashing, public urination, etc. Want more examples or do you concede that your statement was inaccurate? You love to change the subject in an attempt to divert attention from your inaccuracies, don't you? I stand by my statements, do you? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Actually all of those laws apply to women as well. I was stating that when it comes the abortion issue it is only women's organs that you wish to legislate and that is true. Unless of course you agree with chemical castration for men who do not wish to be propogate themselves.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Chemical castration Hell! If I see a pedophile in action, I'll give him the real thing....... with a dull spoon. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Now who is off subject??? Why do I do the abortion thread? GAH. We will never change each other's minds.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Good question, why do you? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Glutton for punishment? Stress releif?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Glad to hear that you use the forum to relieve stress and not induce it in yourself. Life's too short to get bent out of shape over the internet.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Hmm... funny, I don't remember ever hearing a pro-lifer say that pregnancy was a wonderful snuggly thing or the best thing in the world. What I do see is pro-lifers like myself wondering why pregnancy is protrayed ( in the form of a generalization ) as so horrible by people such as yourself who just described it as " unbelievably " hard to go through, or a " life threatening condition " like malignant cancer. You didn't qualify it by saying " some " pregnancies are life threatening or unbearable. Maybe yours was, but how can you say that for every woman in the world? I know for a fact that my wife's pregnancy was not " unbelievably hard to go through " -- she's told me otherwise and I believe her. Sorry, but I believe my wife over you. :) What you did was use unfounded generalizations, which is exactly the sort of thing this thread is about.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I'm sorry, this is pretty damn funny, coming from a pro-life person :p You said the opportunity was wonderful. How can you say that for every woman in the world? If they do not want that opportunity, it is not wonderful for her. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>A healthy baby being born is always a wonderful thing, as long as mother is safe too. :)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Jyoshu, The ' opportunity ' to bring a child into the world is not always wonderful for every women. You cannot speak for every woman and you should not be able to decide for every woman. JPSartre 12, Pregnancy is always a physical detriment to the woman's body. That it is survivable ( most of the time in this day and age ) does not change that fact. Sometimes it is a larger risk, sometimes a smaller, but it is always a physical detriment. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Sure, in the same sense of walking along the sidewalk with the risk of a car jumping the curb, in this day and time anyway... It's NOT the 19th century, in fact.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>And if you don't want the risk, should you be relegated to never walking on the sidewalk, ever? And if you get hit by that car, should you not be allowed medical care if you do not want to live with the consequence? You seem to have no trouble forcing that risk upon women when they do not wish to take that risk. Unless you can take the fetus out of her, pregnancy is a physical detriment to her body. Actually, we can speak for every pregnancy in terms of how it affects the body. Neither you nor I can speak for how the pregnancy is percieved by the woman. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>But at least I'm not willing to have the car occupant killed to avoid that risk.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Would you object to my right to kill the driver if he was driving right toward me and there was no other way to avoid my fate? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I've already answered the question by saying that I think abortions when the mother's life is at risk should be allowable.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Oh? But you said this : I guess this means that you would be willing to kill the car occupant to avoid the risk :) However, lets say that we don't know how badly the car will hurt you, much like in pregnancy we have no way of knowing how much it will harm the woman.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>we are discussing the reasons given for having abortions. these are the reasons women give why they choose to have abortions. a medical examiner cannot tell a woman why she is having an abortion<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I agree. Your point? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>you are arguing that the reasons women give for having abortions are invalid because it is self-reporting. the only way a woman can give a reason why she is having an abortion is by self reporting. therefore the fact still remains that the physical and anatomical damage caused by pregnancy was never reported by women as a reason for abortion, so it is clearly not why women have abortions. people that use these reasons to justify why abortion choice should be upheld are not in touch with the real reasons women have abortions. and while the physical damage reasons are valid, they are apparently not what women consider when making their choice<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, I am arguing that statistics are not accurate because it is self-reporting. And if self-reporting is as inaccurate as several reports bemoan, how is it " clearly not why "? Nope, not true. Whatever her reasons are abortion is justified. Again, even the studies you cited had many states where the majority of the reasons are not known. The studies you cited stated that self-reporting is inaccurate. The studies you cited stated that there are multiple reasons for a woman's decisions, never just one. The studies you cited had voluntary involvement. This is hardly a firm backing. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>the statistics accurately report the reasons women give as to why they chose to have abortions. the only way women can give their reasons for having an abortion is through self reporting. the choice to have an abortion is a personal issue for the woman in question. the reasons given stem from that personal aspect. how is it innacurate? it serves the intended purpose<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Ok, you got me ;) it is accurate reporting of inaccurate information. Yes, the only way to get the reasons is through self-reporting, and it has been shown to be inaccurate. This has been shown in studies regarding breast cancer, where abortions can be verified via records but self-reporting skewed the results.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What you did was use unfoundedgeneralizations, which is exactly the sort of thing this thread is about.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And the assertion that pregnancy is a " wonderful miracle " would be what? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I said " bringing a life into the world " was a wonderful miracle. It is -- a baby is always wonderful, even if a woman doesn't want it.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Part of the process of " bringing a life into the world " is known as pregnancy. So you mean the " baby " is wonderful but not necessarily the " bringing ". Was I supposed to be able to infer that? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You can't draw a distinction between the two. ( Well, you can, but it would be a disingenous distinction. ) The pregnancy leads to the baby -- end the pregnancy and you have no baby, period.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>A " wonderful miracle " as you maintain is a generalization as it pertains to being pregnant since according to you it cannot be separated from the " baby ".<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What have you done about this apparent genocide on your doorstep steeeve? - Wez<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Are you really curious or are you trying to set up an extreme argument where if I am not spending 100% of my time getting rid of abortion then I must not really be against it? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Well, I'm curious if so many people are pro-life and truly believe tens of millions of people are murdered, why so much effort is put into combating terrorism, drugs etc. instead of making abortion illegal. - Wez<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You mean in a federal dollar sense? Well, the Supreme Court kind of put a set back on the whole anti-abortion thing.... that is what the pro-lifers are working on now... which is oddly enough a joint battle to get the Supreme Court back to where it should be. Does this question your question or was it something different? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It does, but it seems like a fairly weak effort if people really think hundreds of Americans are murdered every day. If 100 s of Americans were picked at random and shot I reckon there'd be a greater outcry. What I'm getting is that I'm doubtful whether most pro-lifers really consider the life of a foetus as important as that of a grown up, or whether they are against abortion for other reasons. - Wez<br><b> S2:3-  </b>There wouldn't be an outcry if half the country was ok with it. Believe me when I say that pro-lifers ( most ) believe strongly that the unbron is just as important as anyone else. I also believe many people aren't informed about abortion. If you showed one of those people a picture of a 6 week old unborn and said " would you support aborting this? " I wonder what they might say. I think there might be more of a rationlization to say the unborn is not as important as grown up then to say it is as important.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Can't a doctor be sued for this? Leave it to the Rethuglicans : " cutting the lawsuits " " keeping the government out of our medical records " What a bunch of sorry jack***** that waste the taxpayers ' time and money. We need to post the medical information for Oklahoma's legislators on line. Starting with their viagra medications, vasectomies, history of sexually transmitted diseases, prostate issues, number of women they've impregnated, number of times they've impregnated a woman.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You're fine with forcing others to pay for your healthcare but you don't want anybody to be able to gather anonymous info in order to better address the number of abortions performed. I guess as long as somebody else is paying, it's all good to you. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>My healthcare? Show me where I've said anything about my healthcare. The information isn't anonymous because women can be identified, especially in a small town. Besides, the women have a right to privacy and the doctors are obliged under law to respect doctor / patient confidentiality. So you can't even clear hurdle one, by a LONG shot. As usual, you waste our time and money, and burden society with your spiteful ways. So your view is ridiculous by logic and law. Here, too, and absurd -- since you're the one who wants the taxpayers to foot the bill for this bull. While you also clog up our court system with unnecessary cases. We could easily do without any of you in America. Why don't you move to a country like Afghanistan? Where the laws are more sympatico with that imaginary place you go to, when you roll your eyes up into your head...<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You're in favor of government-run heaithcare, right? And who funds the government? Right, OP ( other people ). :p Show me where a woman's anonymity is compromised, specifically. And if we're talking a small town, won't people see her going into the clinic? Did your mother have any kids that lived? Actually, if I'm the one paying for it, then I should be allowed to find a way to make it cost me less. There's no such thing as a free abortion. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So you mean you cannot show me where I've said anything about my healthcare. So we've finished with that one. So I guess I have a right to see YOUR medical records then? Because people can see you walking into your doctor's office. Those studies have already been done. There's been no mystery for some time as to what reduces the number of abortions. ( Besides the fact that you're not paying for anyone's abortion since they're not federally funded at present. ) Nor do you need to post data on the internet in order to conduct a study. You're just spiteful.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>That's it! I'm spiteful. Of course, your saying that abortions aren't federally funded now is a lie, but that's OK, since you've already been exposed.... so to speak.... I'll continue to humor you, dude. ;)<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Jyoshu and Steeeeeeve, you really haven't answered my question : How would you like to die in the same way as Prudence died? Would you enjoy dying in that manner? Would you consider your death to be just a necessary step in making sure that all abortions are stopped? Would you relish your martyrdom?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I wouldn't want to die in ANY manner. But what does this have to do with abortion? The reason I didn't reply ( and probably the same with Steeeeve ) is that the article is not even about abortion. There's no evidence in the article that Prudence even wanted an abortion, or that if she had, that she wouldn't have been allowed to get one. It mentions the family not having the money to pay for the removal of a dead fetus, but that's not the abortion issue. It seems to me that the problem here is mainly the fact that overall medical care in 3rd world countries is generally pretty bad compared to the U.S. and other more developed nations. So on that, of course I agree with you that it would be better if they had better overall medical care and didn't use midwives. Why on earth would I not agree with you here??? This has nothing to do with a woman choosing to kill her living unborn baby. We have no idea if this woman wanted an abortion. Furthermore, it seems the topic of the article is more about the inequality between men and women in the African country where it took place, rather than about abortion specifically. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Prudence's death is directly related to the abortion issue because Bush has drastically cut U.S. funding for international maternal healthcare, using the excuse that he might be paying for abortions. The Roman Catholic Church, for example, seems to have a hissyfity every time the term " reproductive healthcare " is mentioned. Prudence died because women are still considered dirt throughout the world, most especially by religions and rightwing Republican terrorists.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That's quite a stretch! Your problem should be with Bush, not with pro-lifers ; I'd have no problem with Bush earmarking more money for women's health. If that's the only link you can find between the story you posted and the abortion issue, then I'd have to assume that if Bush earmaked the money again but somehow made sure it was for women's healthcare for everything except abortion, that would be ok with you, since the article didn't involve abortion in any way. If woman are considered " dirt ", that's still a separate issue from whether or not abortion is the right thing to do. It's fallacious to try and associate the pro-life stance with things like this -- no pro-lifer I've ever known of would want this to happen to anyone. The fact remains you used a story that has nothing to do with abortion in a debate about abortion. There is no reason to assume what happened to Prudence would not have still taken place regardless of whether or not abortion was legal. If your point was simply that women should receive better healthcare, of course I'd agree. But then so would every pro-lifer I've ever known. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So-called " pro-life " when one woman a minute dies throughout the world because of pregnancy? When most of the anti-choice, anti-women, anti-life people are opposed to contraception and the idea of reproductive healthcare?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Wow, this is just simply not true. Simone, I'm not going to discuss this any further with you because you're just being reactionary and offering mostly rhetoric here. You're also using instances where women did not choose to abort but lost their baby anyway to argue for right to abortion, and it's just not any valid argument whatsoever.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Im gonna have to go with Love Never Dies here. Ive read that story, and many, many people have been killed and suffered with Bush's policy in africa. Just because you never heard of it, doesnt mean it hasnt happened.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Ok... many many people have been killed in Africa because of the policies of the countries in the EU, South America, Asia, and so on.... this hypocrisy annoys me. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Fixed it for you. Any Anti-Choice advocate obviously cares more about a cell than a woman. I believe the word for it is " Sexism ". I myself think women are worth more than cells.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The Pro-Death people believe some humans are worth more than others... I believe the word for it is " Discrimination ". I assume you think an unborn is " a cell " but they are just not. The unborn has a sex at any point during a pregnancy... so sexism doesn't really play a role. These " anti-choice " just don't think you should have a choice about what humans you find worthy of life... seems reasonable to me. Perhaps this article reflects more the " pro death " position than the " anti-choice " one. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Well, i believe women are worth more than cells. You just stated, in fancy wording, that you didnt, and that you thought it was reasonable. Fixed it for you again<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I agree with you 100%... my point was that " anti-choice " isn't as bad as they are trying to make it. It is almost funny when someone uses it. It is also true that someone that uses it ( unless in a joking manner ) probably doesn't understand the opposite position at all. Woman are cells... So what you are telling me is that women are worth more than women... that makes no sense. What you are trying to do is state that an unborn human is worth less than a women. I find it sad that you wish to rank humans but I suppose you have no problem ( in reasoning atleast ) with someone ranking blacks less than whites or jews less than others... etc. You misquote me again and you get reported. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Women are REAL humans who feel REAL pain. I find it sad that YOU try to rank humans. But, even more sad, you think that the cell is worth MORE than a woman. Another completely moot comparison. " The color of skin makes no difference. What is good and just for one is good and just for the other, and the Great Spirit made all men brothers. " - White Sheild In other words, Blacks, Jews, and Whites are pretty much the same. Sadly i am forced to rank lives, becaues PLs are demolishing common sense as we know it. Im sure as hell not going to let them run around and deny our women reproductive rights. You have forced me to rank life because you are valuing cells more than women. And yes, i am trying to state than an unborn stomach cell is worth less than a women, because you XXXXXX are trying to kill women in order to save stomach cells. I claim my first victory.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I agree... and there is lots of life sitting in state homes waiting for that hope! Let's take care of them first then we can take care of the unborn.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Its better then being dead............. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Tell that to Josh who I reffered to earlier.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I am telling to any pro abortion type who believes its better to be dead......... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Look to say a pro-choice person thinks death is better than life is to show you don't know the individual. Like I said did you read the entire post? How many of your friends that are pro choice are working with, or giving homes to the unwanted kids that exsist now?? This is, and remains my argument with keeping choice legal, I have flatly stated I don't think it " s a good idea!! But lets start with the ones that exsist NOW not the ones that may exsist.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Its tragic that there are children already born without a family but it is a completely different subject becasue that is not the problem with new borns which is what we are debating here.......... <br><b>S1:4-  </b>It is the subject of this debate... Please READ the entire post. My point remains Shouldn't pro lifers focus on taking care of the unwanted kids that exsist first and then move on to those not yet here?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Here is the question..... <br><b>S1:5-  </b>And I stated it in the 2nd thread. Please read it!!!!<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Second thread? Johnson al the posts make up this one thread....... What second thread are you talking about? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Moccing my lack of forum savy won't help your position.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Johnson can you tell me the post number in question........ I am not mocking you my friend............ I was just confused by what you are asking.. I apologize......... <br><b>S1:7-  </b>Post #2.. I thought it was a reasonable answer to a difficult question.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>Do you have any idea how long the waiting list is for new born babiues to be adopted? I have friends that waited 5 years........ I know people who have waited 3 years and ended up adopting in Korea and Indonesia.......... The point I am trying to make to you is there are no unwanted newborns in the USA....... <br><b>S1:8-  </b>I would not dispute that there are lot's of people waiting in line for newborns,,. But my point remains, and is made clear by your statement. Do they have to be newborns befor we fight for their rights?<br><b> S2:8-  </b>Of course not but they are alive.... They have hope.......... There are a lot of children who were raised in orphanages that turned out to ne responsible successful citizens........ All I ask is if possible give that baby in the room the same chance.......... <br><b>S1:9-  </b>And all I ask is that we quit heckeling weomen at abortian clinicks untill we have taken care of all those alive today.<br><b> S2:9-  </b>No, that is not wht you asked........... You asked about children aready born.... As far as anyone be they extreme left or right if they break the law they should be prosecuted to the full extent of it........ All sensible pro life believe that........ <br><b>S1:10-  </b>Uh? Ok Yes I asked about taking care of the unwanted children alive now first... that would of course include " children aready born "!! Where did this law breaking stuff come from / What are you talking about?<br><b> S2:10-  </b>If people at abortion murder clinics break the law in their protesting they should be arrested and prosecuted........... The right to assemble peacefully is guareented in our constitution....... When people on the left protest the war and burn american flags they practice that right..... It works both ways........... <br><b>S1:11-  </b>Well well we have found somthing we can agree on! People breaking the law at abortion clinics or anywhere else should be arrested. You may be suprised to learn I myself think flag burning is a simple waste of time. That said I still am not ready to arrest sombody for it. I don't think its a good way to exercise ones first amendment rights. It does not bother me that it works both ways!<br><b> S2:11-  </b>Well Johnson since I have seen men fight and die for that flag I have to part company with you on this one............. I would see the a constitutional amendement banning the buring of the American Flag and to see left wing whackos burning it at demonstrations against the war in Iraq and our brave troops fighting there really saddens me.......... <br><b>S1:12-  </b>I think we parted way befor this. And you should not assume I dislike flag burning any more or less than you. I too have lost friends and famly members to not this war but others. By the way I'm not a left wing whacko... I'm also not a right wing whacko...<br><b> S2:12-  </b>I am sorry you feel that way........ It doesn ; t matter though...... I don't assume anything...... Don't be so defensive and sensitive..... I did not call you anything........ I called the nuts that burn the American Flag at protests against the war and our troops left wing whackos....... Lighten up, you know what you are............. :) <br><b>S1:13-  </b>I my self try to always keep it light. I don't think there was anything in my post that said anything about name calling,... thats just something I ignore. Perhaps you just thought I was " defensive and sensitive "? ><br><b> S2:13-  </b>and I called you neither...........<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I think that has been covered extensively but I will try for you one more time...... It is very sad that there are unwanted children in orphanages. I thin kwe can all agree on that.......... At least the children have a chance at life.... There are a lot of children who grew up in orphanges have gone out to be great Americans.......... Why should a baby in the womb not have at least that same opportunity?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It certainly would be nice if that baby got the same opportunity as babies whose mother chose to carry them to term. However the choice to carry that baby to term is the mother's choice, and not ours. It is regrettable if a woman chooses not to carry her baby to term, and even more regrettable if she does so without being informed of the associated risks and costs of whatever abortion procedure is being used. However, it is much more regrettable for us to deny that woman her personal autonomy in the matter. We cannot force her to submit her body to the interests of other people, including her unborn child. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You must know that about half the people in the U.S. disagree with you as does God.....<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well then, I'm sure that half the people in the US are also glad that the West won both WWII or the Cold War, and that they don't have to live in a country where personal autonomy and freedom is being eroded in the name of a state ideology. Also, God mentioned to me that you're misquoting him and in fact he agrees that freedom of will is paramount in this matter. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>God according to the bible believes in the sanctity of life and that all life is precious......... That is what is taught through the RCC of which I am a member........<br><b> S2:3-  </b>God, according to my religion, holds that the value of life is determined by what is done to produce produce and sustain that life. We may not live at the unwilling expense of others. So God teaches us by the Book. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well that is your religion and it must not follow the bible and the teachings of Jesus Christ............<br><b> S2:4-  </b>True. It would be against the Word of God to be a Christian or to follow the Bible. As Gamaliel points out in the Bible, that which is of God will flourish despite all opposition, and that which is against God will perish in due time. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>hmmmmmm OK :)<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I really don't know the situation in the u. s but over here there are actualy more foster parent's and adoptive parent's waiting to be aproved than we have that are aproved if we cut all the red tape we would process prospective parents a lot quicker and the childrens homes and such will begin to empty. Of course you will always have the crisis children that is something only humanity can help. Have you ever thought of adopting or fostering a crisis child? Not being bitchy just a little plug for my little mates who need parent's. :)<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The situation in America is appaling ( I don't have the exact figures but I'm shure some kind soul on this forum will provide them. ) Yes I have worked with some of these children, and my sister is a foster care provider. I can't even begin to describe some of the emotional and physical scars some of these kids carry... It breaks my heart to see and the thought of more entering this system brings me to tears. Again... Let's fix the mess we have now then worry about what might be. P.S. I've acutally had one of these childern tell me they whish nthey had never been born.... I told him I was glad he was here. He was moved a few weeks later and I haven't seen him since. I hope he finds someone else who is glad he's here.. and says so! <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I hope he finds some real parents soon it sucks when they keep moving these kids around they have enough turmoil to deal with as it is.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>My point exactly!! So lets quit this crazy argument over abortion and get thes kids some homes!! This is here and now let's take care of it first then move to those who are not yet here. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>What is wrong with speaking out for the innocents i devote equal amounts of time to both my causes?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So you provide care for or have adopted a homeless child I take it If so bless you the world needs more people like you. But I still don't think all those out there at abortion clinics have given as much.. and in My opinion they should start at the living not the unborn. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I foster crisis children I would love to be able to take all the children who need a home but unfortunatly that isn't realistic. I did start at the living and now i am on to the unborn but that does not stop me taking in the poor little mites that are brought to my door by social services at 2 or 3 oclock in the morning as i said what is wrong with speaking out for the innocents?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I never said it was illegal... there is no law outlawing it. I said there is no law saying abortion is ok. So why is no one enforcing it? Probably because we believe that the Supreme Court can set policy. huh? You put words in my mouth and I never said that. It is the wrongful killing of a life. What is wrong then? Well, I don't set what is wrong and I don't believe a government does either but rather should draw from it. The belief would be a standard of what is right and wrong. However, if you have no government does that mean it is ok for someone to steal from you? You would be ok with this as you would find nothing wrong with it because no law says it is wrong. well, try looking at it from the babies shoes. I think he / she might say something different. Still wondering where that " right to personal autonomy " comes from as no one has really given me a real answer. The unborn is forced to be killed. I am not talking about the women being compared to the Jews... I am comparing the unborn.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It was an observation, not a quotation ;) Well, that is the issue here - you say that abortion is wrong and murder ( I guess you mean an abortion by choice as opposed to medical need, but maybe you think any abortion is murder ) but where does that view come from? I mean, it is far less qualified than the complex balance of opinion that decides national law on abortion that draws on expertise from all parties in the debate. But despite this arbitary position ( you choose to ignore the reasons of the for allowing abortion, unlike the law which has considered them ) you expect to be taken seriously - that will never happen as long as you continue to do the intellectual equivalent of giving so many important issues the finger. How can any such approach become a " standard of right and wrong " when you are deaf to the reality of the issue as a whole? I think theft is wrong, government or no government. I also think a woman should have some control over the fact that nature has given her all the responsibility in growing a baby, government or no government. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>you think theft is wrong without government.. you said the following... Would you like to clarify your position?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The law is how we articulate notions such as theft being wrong into meaning in society - theft is not right, but it is the law that gives that definition and meaning through the punishment the state bestows on those found guilty of that crime. The same is true without law - people are still going to be ticked off if someone steals from them, but what you do about that has no boundaries except that which the individual chooses to observe. Anyway Steeeeve, you failed to respond to my previous statement : Or has the cat got your tongue? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No the cat is sitting on her window seat. And I did not fail to reply to your statement, I just didn't realise a response was wanted. So what is your question?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Perhaps you missed the question marks, so I've put them in bold for you this time : There you go.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Jew is spelled with a capitol J.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>lol... completely odd and ironic. I am sure he meant Jew and you meant capital.. so lets leave it there :) <br><b>S1:2-  </b>So STEEEEVE ; How many lives have you saved, thru MTM, CPR, etc., huh? And at least I can spell a major faith properly ; even a three lettered one.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>glad to know you bring spelling into this. Shows where you are in the argument. And where did the life saving question come from? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Since you happen to be pro-life, this retired P.A. would like to know how many lives have you gone out of your way to save by learning the life-saving practices of MTM, CPR, or the Heimlich Manuever ; or is your love for the fetus only, not all of mankind.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>My love is for all people. However, I know you will be respectful and not inquire about my personal past in farther. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I'm not asking you about the direct past, since you have no medical training, but when will you learn CPR, MTM, The Heimlich Manuever, so you can save lives in the future? Life seems important to you, and this is in no way disrespectful.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I never said half those things that you claim. That is all I wish to say on this matter. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Those who actually care about saving a life, go out of their way to learn those simple procedures. They don't just go on and on about a procedure, if Roe is reversed, will place more women's lives in peril.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Simone, wrong as usual........... Opposed to contraception....... What are you talking about? Snd I am for comprehensive education, but not by abortion butcher doctors who profit frome the butcher acts.......<br><b> S2:1-  </b>There is no such thing as " abortion butcher doctors. " They are OB / GYN's who provide valuable pre-natal and post-natal health care to those women who visit the PPhood's. Should a possible birth endanger the woman's life, do you want to take the tools those M.D. ' s are entrusted with, and have those women, without means, lose their life? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Anyone that performs and unnecessary abortion for profit is a butcher doctor......... because you liberals have made murder in the womb legal does not make it right............<br><b> S2:2-  </b>How will you know it is un-necessary? Again ; do you want to take the tools M.D. ' s are trained to use away from those who may need to save a life? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Again for the one thousand time I would like a board of independent doctors to make the decision on whether and abortion should take place.......... I don't want the abortion doctor who profits by performing the abortion to make the decision........ I think if that was done you could probably knock out about 80 or 90 percent of all abortions........ Now make a note of that so I don't have to say it again...... thanks............<br><b> S2:3-  </b>O.B. / G.Y. N. ' s are trained to know the business of protecting a woman's life. While you wait to be satisfied with a board of " independent doctors ", women may face risks to their lives you are unqualified to know anything about. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>A lot of abortion butchers are not OB / GYNs and you know that............. The difference between you and me is you think that all 40,000,000 abortions since 1972 were necessary and you could care less about the innocent baby in the womb............... I care for both the mother and the baby in the womb and I think that about 90 percent of them could have been avoided.......... Again, there are exceptions to every rule.........<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I guess that is your way of apologizing for the heroics I went into with that baby. I can't expect anything more from you, because you think I donot value life. You obtain the education I needed to save lives, and maybe you will have respect for the medical profession ; hell, even your local paramedics. You haven't a clue as to who I am, but I will I tell you that I know that if you make abortion illegal, the stripped of their licenses M.D. ' s will set up shop, and the abortions will continue, only they will be less safe. It will be like prohibition all over, again. Then abortion won't matter to you, even though it is being done by those who haven't practiced medicine, or those who lost their licenses. Sadly then, women will definitely die. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Yeah that is one baby, I just widh you felt the same way about all babies that were being aborted............<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I guess you are the only person who feels like you can control the many women in the world. Okay sport, go try ; at least I had the education to work to save lives as I did. But you tell yourself you are the one and only good Catholic in the world, and do nothing to save anyone's life. Ever learn CPR? Don't bother, I know the answer.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>that still doesn't answer my question. Who created that right that exists because the body politic admits that right? As for the 4th amendment, I didn't see anything that says personal autonomy there. In fact, I don't recall the framers ever thinking it would mean that. It clearly talks about unreasonable search and seisure and that is all. It doesn't say " you can do whatever you want with your own body "... it says " someone can't go through all your stuff, search you, without a warrant or probable cause ".. maybe it is in the fine print. You might end up saying something like " well the fetus is seizing something from the person "... to which I reply " that is not unreasonable and it says search and seisure... not or " as he / she was forced to be created there by a willing act of someone and now it is the only place he / she can survive. gotta go to work.. will reply to the rest later<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Who created it is beside the point. You might find this link helps to explain things : http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-rights/ <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It does if you wish to prove the right exists beyond government. Otherwise if the government got rid of the " rigth " then you could have no objection what so ever to it because they aren't denying you a right because it doesn't exist. In fact, we would never " create " new rights ( think back to the days of slavery ) because one could not claim a right that doesn't exist. So if you say the right still exists beyond government then you would need to show where it came from.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I thought that it was obvious that rights are prior to government and are assumed by a body politic, the society and culture that creates the space in which a government apparatus may be erected. And I keep pointing out that this right is a necessary component of any rights-based system such that anyone who agrees that there are rights must agree that there is a right to personal autonomy. Yeah, I answered that one in my discussion with Chloe ( post #128 ), pointing out that life is incidental to personal autonomy. I think I also talked about that in this thread as well. I really suggest you read the link on legal rights so that I don't have to waste my time giving a lecture on how rights work. Thanks. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Why? The US has no right to personal autonomy. I see no law that says this. Search and Seizure doesn't work as that is not personal autonomy. That is having the right for someone ELSE to not search you. Nothing about you being able to do what you want to do to yourself. Yeah read it. IT makes no sense as a right to life is essential for any other right. Then don't respond... and I did read it by the way.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>As I read the passage : So you wouldn't call being required to host an unwanted fetus as an unreasonable seizure of their person? Security of persons against unreasonable search and seizure seems to me to constitute the very essence of a right to personal autonomy - the gov't doesn't get to dispose of your body or possessions without your permission. It can't sell you into slavery, for example. You may want to re-read it because I explain how a right to life is incidental or derivative of more essential rights, and how it is necessarily trumped by these rights, including the right to personal autonomy. Here's the gist, so you know what to read for : A right to personal autonomy is necessary as a structural component of a system of rights, because it defines how ownership is resolved in a system of rights. The possession and exercise of these rights are incidental to the possession of life. Any right to life is therefore either derivative of these foundational rights, or participates in an incoherent system of rights. Either way, a right to life is trumped by a right to personal autonomy. I'm sorry, it's just that you don't seem to be responding as though you read and understood the material. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Wow, I called that one... remember when I said this... And yes the gov't does dispose of your body without your permission... see abortion. We might even be able to extend this farther... the 14th amendment ( which would superceed any previous one ) says you have the right to life that can't be taken away without due process of the law. So in a sense, we can't even kill the baby without due process right?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>sinjin and gansao, Are you against FORCING people to have a background check prior to owning a handgun or FORCING people who own a business to pay for insurance offering contraception or FORCING people to purchase health insurance in general? I just want to understand what the criteria is for forcing something upon others in your mind.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>A background check is meant to exclude one from the list of those prohibited from legally purchasing firearms. The transvaginal ultrasound in question serves no public interest other than to attempt to discourage women from obtaining a legal medical procedure because it is morally repugnant to some. As far as the contraception question goes, I think it is like other lifestyle choices that are personal and should not be open to picking and choosing by the employer. Comprehensive medical coverage is just that. Otherwise employers could decide not to cover any sort of lifestyle choices made by employess they didn't like. Overeating, smoking, too much procreating, alcohol related treatment. I asked before and I'll ask again. If the church is against out of wedlock births should they be able to deny maternity benefits to an unmarried employee? How is that different? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>So forcing something is not really the problem so much as whether or not " forcing " is in the public interest. To you it is not but to others it might be, yes?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The procedure is neither in the public interest nor that of the patient's. It's legal coercion inspired by religion. When my son was born I was " required " to listen to a 15 minute lecture on why circumcision was now a bad thing before I could have my son cut. I found it offensive since the lecture had nothing to do with medicine. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>That's for the public to decide now isn't it. Nevertheless, my point was that " forcing " was never really the issue... just whether or not you agree with THAT to be forced since you don't believe their is an interest. I'm fine if you think it is a bad law because it doesn't serve a valid purpose but don't say " forcing " is the reasoning behind it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I don't think so. Public will is subordinate to the Constitutional rights of the individual. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Right but you said " public interest " and that would clearly be defined by the public. Nothing discussed on this thread has any constitutional questions.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Why shouldn't a women be forced to see the image before getting a legal elective procedure? How would like to be required to submit to a prostate exam and provide a semen sample before you could buy condoms?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Contraception and terminations are two completely different procedures with two completely different outcomes. Are the use of prophylactics the same procedure or even directly related to medical procedures to treat sexually transmitted diseases? You need to try harder than than Even if it was a requirement to provide a sperm sample and submit to a prostate examination before I could but condoms I would still have a choice ( unlike your child ) I would not be forced to do anything and it cetainly would not be tantamount to rape If after buying condoms a finger was forcibly thrust into my rectum and after that I was locked in a room with a dirty mag and told not to come out without a sperm sample then I could say that I was forced to do these things. That is why I object to the word force as well as the word rape.. both are incorrect and dishonest. They suggest coercion and helplessness when none exist ( except in your case ). I am not forced to provide money in order to purchase goods it is a requirement. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Contraception is morally repugnant to some religious folks just as abortion.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So is eating pork apparently... beef to some. So what? What does religion have to do with the conversation between you and I? I never raised it and you dont believe in it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Religion as everything to do with the law we are discussing.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It has nothing to do with the false accusations of rape and forced being injected into the proceedings. You may have religion on your mind regarding abortion and contraception but there are ethical and moral perspectives outside of religion that would require a woman to look at the potential child that she is about to destroy. Abortion is not just about relieving oneself of a parasite. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>" Potential child " is a meaningless term. What something may become is not what it is. Where outside of religion is a person composed of 2,4,8 cells? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_fallacy<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No its not a fetus is a potential child. It is a term that is just as meaningful as ' person ' I never said that an 8 celled fetus is a person... in fact I never said a fetus at any stage is a ' person '. Incidentally what ultrasound scanner can produce an image for a 2,4,8 celled fetus? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>No, it is not or else we wouldn't see a move in a number of states to make conception the point when one has rights.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>They may see it as a religious issue.. so what? We are not considering the religious issue of termination. That wasnt the OP. If the fetus was considered a person with rights the woman would not be allowed an abortion... period <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Who do you suppose is sponsoring the legislation? Since it isn't a person, why should a woman be " required " to see images of it before aborting? Why are her rights subordinated to this non-person?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>I dont care What rights? Her right to not see it? If we are to enter a brave new world of disposable fetuses then at least the woman should look at the thing before she destroys it. If only to remind her to take the pill or demand her boyfriend uses a rubber next time especially if the state is paying for it. Jeez that poor darling who would have to bear the agony of looking at an image of the ' parasite ' inside her would probably not baulk at looking inside her hanky before binning it ( and if it is a ' non person with no rights and a parasite to boot then whats the problem? ). If people are to indulge in the grown up world of sexual intercourse then they should face up to the consequences of feckless behaviour during it. People like you who demonise or present fetuses as parasites not worthy of a second look before crushing and binning are doing nothing for humanist morality. See no god <br><b>S1:7-  </b>No, her right not to be compelled to undergo an invasive and unnecessary medical procedure to satisfy someone else's agenda. Who are you to decide that? Because you know she's been careless. The State forcing her for no medical reason. Feckless? Is it the sex or your lack of getting your share that's bothering you? I've done no such thing. I simply wish to let the woman decide while it's early without coercion either way.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>Some say that abortion is an invasive and unnecessary medical procedure People should have the courage to look at the thing they want to destroy. Most incidence of sexual congress are mutually agreed and contraception is very reliable so the odds are that she was. Careless or not she should be a witness to what she wishes to destroy. There may be no ' medical ' reason to terminate the fetus I take it you have no argument so you chose to insult me instead While its early? So how would looking at an image of an ' early ' fetus coercion. You want the fetus to be seen as a liability, something of no importance because it suits your agenda of abortion on demand. It has nothing to do with womens rights, instead it has everything to do with the notion that the fetus should be given no rights. Thats why you insist that a deluded religious person can believe a fetus has any right to a second thought from either the mother or the State.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Because you cannot reverse an incorrect United States Supreme Court decision with a ballot. Simple as that. Additionally, prior to 1973, abortion was already settled democratically in most states. And, regardless of whether 99.9% of the people in the US approve of the court's decision in Roe, that decision would still be judicial activism, and as such, would still merit reversal by the Supreme Court.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>No more so than the Scalia / Uncle Clarence Thomas cabal opining that the words NO LAW mean something other than what they do when they rule in a First Amendment case. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I doubt you can cite Scalia as an activist in First Amendment cases when he has voted to overturn bans on flag burning. You really should try to think before you speak ; or perhaps you actually did, in which case we should simply conclude that you have no idea what you are talking about. Regardless, any decision that holds that something is in the Constitution, when in fact it really is not, is wrong and merits reversal no matter which judges perpetrate the wrong decision.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So then, are we to presume that you would favor the sale and distribution of, to take the worst possible example, kiddie porn with no restrictions? After all, the First Amendment says " Congress shall make NO LAW abridging freedom of the press. BTW, re. Texas v. Johnson : Is a flag burning speech, and where in the Constitution does it say so? I agree with the decision, which simply goes to prove that even a blind Antonin can find a peanut now and then. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No, we should not presume that. In fact, I support legislation banning the same because the Constitution has never, ever protected obscenity. In fact, its original import was far less protective of certain categories of speech than it even is today. Is sign language speech? You agree with the decision, but evidently for the wrong reasons.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You can favor banning it all you want ; just remember that this is exactly the same type of " legislating from the bench " you have decried. Can you spin the words NO LAW in any other manner than NO LAW? And Scalia and Uncle Clarence Thomas call themselves " Textualists ". Old Nino himself said so on 60 Minutes when Leslie Stahl skewered him but good. HUMBUG!! They write their personal predilections into their opinions just as much as any other Justice. It's just that you like their biases. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>No, it isn't. The question is not whether congress can make a law, the question is : what is " the freedom of exercise, speech, press, assembly. " These terms have objective, historic meaning, and from that it is clear that the First Amendment does not prohibit Congress ( or state legislatures ) from prohibiting the possession or distribution of obscenity. The First Amendment also happens not to cover many other forms of " speech / press. " For example, under the objective and historic meaning of the First Amendment, Congress certainly may ban a news agency from publishing nuclear secrets, etc. Actually, Scalia and Thomas are originalists. Originalism uses textualism as a starting point in Constitutional construction. No, they really don't. And no, I don't like or dislike their alleged biases.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>So its their fault if the condom breaks? Dont speak of people this way until you are in their shoes. Im sure that there are some lazy people out there, but ill be the majority was just accidents, and therefore cannot be blamed on the woman.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Perhaps you wish for the Trojan company to pay for the abortion? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Its better than banning abortion.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Isn't it their fault now? Why don't you want them to pay for the abortion..o r part of it. It is the fault of the maker is it not? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Its nobody's fault. Why do you always have to blame someone. You think we can fix this by total criminalization?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>no ones fault so you kill the kid.... great. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Were not killing any kids dude.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Your kidding right? I am talking about the pro-life nut cases that bomb abortion clinics.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>glad to know you think all pro-lifers support bombing abortion clinics. Should just stop listening to you now? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Would you please show me where I said all please. Now who is generalising. I said the, not all, pro-life nut cases. Unless some one would next consider all pro-lifers to be nut cases also.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You said : Linus responded with this but not that you refer only to " pro-lifers " in the above statement. You responded... clarifying what you meant by your comments. This shows that you use " pro-lifers " and " pro-life nut cases " as the same thing.... maybe you wish to clarfiy this though. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So some how a clarification is me stating all?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I'm just wondering why you said " pro-lifers " and then couldn't believe that Linus didn't know you were talking about " pro-life nut jobs " as if they were one in the same... so do you believe pro-lifers are all nut jobs? Do you believe pro-lifers believe in blowing up abortion clinics? If not... thats all you gotta say. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Not all just some to both questions.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Very well then ; I would like to add that " nut jobs " are not limited to pro-life... sadly it is not limited to anything. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>ROFLMAO :) Y'all are funny today thanks :) True oh so true at times, I will admit, I tend to fall into that nut job catagory<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Yes : Adolph Hitler was lying when he said " we was a socialist ".<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Are the above to quotes contradictory? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No they're not contradictory : Hitler was not a socialist. In his early years he convinced the public that that was the direction he was going because ; as I said, it was popular to do so. In his early years he was a populist and said things that people wanted to hear. If you'd really like an education on his popularism, watch the movie Triumph of the Will ( 1935 ) - IMDb It was done in 1935 when Hiter's popularity had peaked, and by 1935 Auswitch had been opened for two years as prison for political prisoners. Also during 1935 he began his designs on the east. He hid from the public and most of his military contacts all of his designs : that's what it made it work so well ; nobody knew what he was doing at any given time. It was all ' need to know '. The Wehrmach hated him and so did the government. He supplanted the government with his sympathizers and the SS took care of the pressure on the military brass. And the rest is history...<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So let me get this straight, Hitler said he is a socialist ; you admit he said he was a socialist. You also claim he was not a socialist and did not lie about being a socialist. That only leaves that he did think he was a socialist, but you know better. Is that what you are claiming? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I never said that Hitler was a socialist. You're not paying any attention to anyting I've said.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You said several times that he was not, but you did admit he claimed he was a socialist. MMmm.. perhaps they didn't cover this in your English course. When one says ' we ' he refers to others and himself. I agree he's a fascist demagogue, but a fascist is a collectivist ; a cousin of socialist. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I think what you really need is more study time on the subject. You've been beat again, and now you're just resorting to your old nit pick and troll routine. I was very clear, defined my terms and covered a very broad subject very consisely. You simply don't know what you're talking about ; so I'm done arguing with you on this subject any further. When you have read and understood the subejct ( s ) so much so that I can tell you have some modicom of knowledge on it we can continue.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>What's clear is that I caught you in a contradiction.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>My problem is with the pro choicers who see abortion as a solution rather than a failure. Killing a fetus quickly before it gets a brain isnt much better than killing it after it becomes sentient. Every termination should be seen as a result of a failure somewhere along the line<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Now I thought they saw it as a choice. Are all choices solutions? I disagree. Even when the pregnancy is the result of rape? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No So denying a potential child a chance to realise its potential is a OK? You think that a rape which results in a pregnancy that itself results in a potential child being destroyed does not indicate that somewhere along the line there was a failure? You think that aborting the fetus and throwing it away makes it ok? I doubt that the pregnant woman does and it certainly doesnt make it ok for the unborn child ( with or without an ' operational brain ' ).<br><b> S2:2-  </b>One cannot unfairly deny anything to a non-entity. " Its " implies possession. There is no one to possess. No one to deny that to which " they " have a right. I don't pretend to understand each individual situation. I can think of scenarios where an abortion would not be a " failure ". I'm not sure what you mean by " ok "? Part of the problem is that men like you have no problem speaking for women. And again, the " unborn " has no standing even though you'd like to give it a voice. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Part of the problem is that men like you see an unborn child as a problem when it suits you. A fetus it is always a victim when its aborted. People like you label the fetus as a nonentity and even a parasite to justify the act of destroying it You need to dehumanise the fetus and use emotional and extremely rare cases of pregnancy through rape to justify the act of abortion itself. The ' unborn ' does have a standing and there are people that believe quite rightly that it should have a voice and do even though you'd like them not to. People like you think that destroying an early fetus.. getting in quick before the fetus inevitably becomes sentient makes it ' ok ' ( oh I forgot you dont know what this means ) Whereas I cant see the act of destroying an unborn child ever being ok and can only been seen as a failure even if it is deemed the best decision out of number of bad ones.. Maybe you would think this as a success I never speak for women whereas you do. Your dishonesty is noted<br><b> S2:3-  </b>How any man sees it is of no consequence. Assumes facts not in evidence. Wrong. I cannot claim the fetus is something other than it is as a means to limit a woman's right to self-determination. Do not those sorts of cases need to be considered when making law? The point being that the individual circumstances that might lead to a woman's decision to abort are none of my, or your, business. What I like has nothing to do with it and " quite rightly " is merely your opinion. One not shared by a majority of women. Ok by whose standard and for whom was what I was getting at. The " best decision out of number of bad ones " is not my definition of a " failure ". How I think of it is of no consequence. You said, " You think that aborting the fetus and throwing it away makes it ok? I doubt that the pregnant woman does... " <br><b>S1:4-  </b>What? The fetus is the only one that is destroyed in an abortion. How the hell can that be an assumption? There is more than just the woman involved. You claim the fetus has no rights or status until YOU feel it should. You contradict yourself in the same post. First you want the extremes to be the default way to consider policy then you insist its only the womans decision and no ones elses anyway. Make your mind up. What ' you like ' has everything to do with your mere opinion too. The ' majority ' of women can share their opinion.. the destroyed fetus does not have that privilege. I dont agree that the majority of women would believe that a fetus has no standing and an abortion should be considered anything other than a failure... have you access to a poll that says otherwise? You want a standard to help you understand ' ok '? Jeez You dont see a bad decision as a failure? Jeez again So you dont think of it as a failure then say how you think of it is of no consequence? You are probably right then You think that saying ' I doubt that the pregnant woman does ' means that I am ' speaking for women '? Read it again and check your dictionary.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>MSNBC / Liberal hate speech exposed by FOX News Janeane Garofalo Spewing Marxist Propaganda & Hate Speech Towards Conservatives - YouTube<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Marxist hate speech? So, you're still looking for commies under your bed then. She soundds to me like someone who is pissed off at the radical right for all of the lies an unAmercain activity they create and sponsor. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You don't have to hunt for commies. The brain dead imbeciles are coming out of the wood work.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You never have the slightest idea what the hell you're talking about and only say stupid things. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>< Flush > I fought against the Communists in Vietnam, and I know how evil they were, so save your horse manure for someone else.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I doubt that you were in the bush. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I doubt you know enough to make that determination. You numbah ten-thou dinky dow.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I was right : you're lying about your service. figures <br><b>S1:5-  </b>You're full of cr*p too. Not only that but you didn't even notice the clue I left you, which anyone who served in Vietnam should have recognized : You numbah ten-thou dinky dow. You and bird brain and the other deniers probably didn't even have the cojones to join the Boy Scouts. And everybody should know by now all the atrocities the communists committed in South Vietnam and elsewhere. So dummy up.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>You're lying about your service and bringing shame upon yourself and insulting those men who had their ass in the grass ; one of which is my best friend. So you can stop any time now : you're making a profound fool of yourself. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>You're full of horse dung. But then you're a communist sympathizer anyway, so we know you're a loser and a buffoon. And when did you serve your country? Or are you one of those parasites who live off other people's service?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>I came of age in 1975 ; right at the very end of Vietnam. But I ma not a liar about my military service to my country. YOU are a liar about your military service to your country and therefore you briong shame on yourself : hell, you're muuuch worse than a draft dodger. At they were honest about not wanting to serve! You're a sick person. Shame on you<br><b>S1:1-  </b>My problem is with the pro choicers who see abortion as a solution rather than a failure. Killing a fetus quickly before it gets a brain isnt much better than killing it after it becomes sentient. Every termination should be seen as a result of a failure somewhere along the line<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Ya'know ; in some principle you are right. That is not the question however, nor is it the reason for Roe v Wade. The answer, whether we like it or not, is that abortion has existed for generations ; as far back as you'd like to go probably. So, what do we : US do about that? We make it safe, that's what. And we save as many lives as we can : not every woman who wants an abortion takes that route, and we have Planned Parenthood and the clergy to thank for that, <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You may know that I have never stated that abortion should be illegal per se. I have stated that the fetus should have at least some consideration. I, like Sinjin, believe that an early termination should be granted to a pregnant woman on demand. What I do not believe is that it should be seen as anything other than a failure, a failure of society to prevent this situation. I do not subscribe to the view that a fetus should be either dehumanised, considered a parasite or a manifestation of the rapists seed ( as the mad Simone seems to insist it is if it was a product of sexual assault ).<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I agree. char / 10 <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I cant decide whether Ive had an attack of the sensibles or Ive brought you two down to my level :p<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No, I've said I'm a centrist. I can agree with much of the conservative ideal, and when a conservative posses well reasoned arguments and scenarios ; as in this case of abortion, it's hard to disagree. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Im a Brit. I have contributed to and benefitted from a national health service. I dont own a gun and dont want to. I have belonged to a trade union since I was a boy. I subscribe to European centre right politics. To most Americans I am a milksop lefty. I view the screaming reactionary left just as I view the screaming reactionary right... they both use accusation of stereotypes to conceal their lies.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Again, with respect to the looney left, I can't agree with you more. The one I learned in my thrity years in the Teamsters union, is that mixing politics and labor is a bad cocktail. The Teamsters never liked the idea, but as with most of the country's labor, sort of got forced into it, becasue while under fire from the Republicans, it was a way of getting our message heard. The Teamsters however, have never been a partisan group either. The socialist / anrchist / peace and social justice left have done just as much damage to this country in my view as the radical right. Every time I think of extremes in this country, I of images of the KKK, witch burnings, and women burning their bras : it's all silly and dangerous. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Our unions financed the Labour party and forced left wing policy on to them until the Conservative Thatcher government all but destroyed both the unions and Labour during the 1980 s. The influence that the trade union movement had on British politics ( both Labour and Conservative governments ) gave the Trotskyite and Workers revolutionary factions power far beyond what their low numbers should have done. The extreme political leanings of union officials ultimately made Britain a manufacturing basket case. While the Japanese exported good quality cars to us our cars manufacturers were striking over tea breaks and producing ' Friday afternoon ' lemons.. to name just one unionised industry. So I agree with you that politics and labour do not mix. Ive seen the best of union activity and maybe not the worst but some aspects of my own union that I am not proud of.. to say the least. America has more extremes and more extremists than the UK. IMO much of the dynamism of American thought and action comes from the lack of social care in US society.. plus ( believe it or not ) gun ownership. A society where there is no safety net must be more dynamic than a society built around one. However I have no valid opinion on how Americans should live their lives so I try to argue points that are relatively parallel with the UK.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Let's accept your belief. That still doesn't mean abortion came before murder. Again, the earliest records of abortion are in 2600 BC - and Sumerian culture lived way before then, not to mention that there were many other cultures that found murder sinful.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Murder has only been around since the concept of law has been around to define it as such. And even then it was a very narrow definition as well considering that it only applied to members of each tribe or city and not to those outside. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>So if one man from a tribe murdered a child from the same tribe, he wouldn't be punished? Of course he would! Either way, this is irrelivent to the abortion issue. The fetus is a human being and therefore it is wrong to kill it.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Where did Isay any such thing. You're not reading what I say apparently. Wrong a fetus is only a potential human being. Not all situations is killing considered to be murder. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I don    t believe in bringing religion into abortion debates, but I will go on. God only creates goodness. He cannot do evil. However, evil happens on this earth anyway. One can say God created murder ; God created Nazism ; God created hell ; et cetera. However, I don    t understand what you    re talking about God killing two Eves. Charchuk, we    ve already discussed this. I    ve gave you my facts. If you    re just going to be closed minded, I    m not debating with you.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Eve wasn't Adam's first wife. Lilith was his first wife. You persented no facts at all, just tautologic arguements.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>That fallacy again? The world was formed from the Solar Nebula around 4.5 billion years ago. The universe is around 8 to 9 billion years older than our solar system. Before that it is an unknown. As you would know if you'd bother to read what has been posted is that we've never said that it wasn't human. When I say potential I mean a potential human being, a person. That is the point. You believe that DNA is what makes us a human being. Transgenic animals prove you wrong.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>At risk of offending you, where did the nebula come from? ( and yes, I know you know what I am getting at. ) <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The remains of a previous star system. It is the ultimate recycling program. :) A star dies, the expelled material gradually condenses to a critical point and nuclear fusion occurs again. The planets are just left over debris which was far enough away not to get dragged back into the sun but was still able to form on its own. Did you know that Jupiter is a failed star? The Alpha Centari star system had been part of the same nebula as well as Tau Ceti and some other local star systems which gradually had drifted out of the stellar nursery, which had been the nebula to where they are now. One could say that this is how stars reproduce.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Interesting. But where did all this material come from Originally? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>As I had said, unknown. It could have always existed in a never ending cycle of expansion and contraction the same of with the stars, or not. Who created god? If god could have existed forever, then why not the universe? Or the Cosmos? One interesting idea is that since all of the stars systemd within a certain distance of us are all made from the same stellar material that if we ever do make it there and find life bearing worlds it stands a good chance that we'd also be genetically compatible as well.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Those are good questions. I am still pondering that one myself. However, I think it has something to do with the fact that God is sentient and the universe is not. There is a difference between a creator and what is created. My argument is not well thought out as of yet, so I will stop here. I will try to give better soon. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Some on here believe that the universe itself is god and that it is sentient as well and that we are just a tiny part of it. Some people don't like the idea of only being a part instead of being the whole.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I have been pondering this abit. Here is my thinking. The universe exists within a framework. Most folks would call that framework space-time. To be self existent, it would necessarily have to come from outside of the framework. There would have to be something that is outside of time for time to exist. We could call that eternity. No one might say that eternity is a framework and would require something outside of it to exist. That would not follow logically. Eternity by definition is frameless. Boundless. That concept leads to a definition of God. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>There is also the thought that our universe is part of a much bigger framework called the COSMOS where universes are born and die all of the time. Why would god even need to create anything when there is no perception of time for god? And why would god need us to believe in god as well? What would be the point? Do you expect the atoms in your body to worship you? Are you even aware of them on in individual basis as god is suppose to be?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>A ) A pillow at the bottom of a cliff won't save anyone's life. B) They're both born humans. Not embryos. A toddler. Not a blastocyst. I've already made that clear. One is undeveloped - it is more similar to a simpler organism such as a mollusk or fish than a born human. About ALL - These people are lying to you. You are really doing wrong by trying to " counsel " women going into abortion clinics. From Planned Parenthood's website :<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The toddler is undeveloped - it still has another 16 years or so to grow up. What about deformed children? Some of them don    t look human. Can we kill them? Remember the elephant man? People treated him as an animal, and he was sold like an animal, and forced to do tricks. At one point, a crowd of people chased after him, and he ran. He finally was trapped in an alley, and yelled out    I AM A HUMAN BEING   . Just because somebody doesn    t look like what you perceive as a human being, doesn    t mean isn    t one. Umm, yeah that    s what ALL is    so what? They offer post-abortion treatment centers too. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I'm not talking about what they look like. I'm talking about their cellular structure. That said, I've never heard of a disabled person born with a tail, or that in any way resembled a blastocyst ( not even the " Elephant man " did ). So you have no problem spreading lies to " innocent " people walking into abortion clinics? I know. Do you even read other people's posts?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Everyone has tails! So the only way the zygote is going to be human is if somebody BORN looks like it? So the only way a toddler is going to be human is if an ADULT looks like it. Right? Poor logic. If they were lies, I would have problems. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Again I have to ask - do you actually read what people post in response to you? Let's try this - I'm not talking about what they look like. I'm talking about their cellular structure. I'm not talking about what they look like. I'm talking about their cellular structure. I'm not talking about what they look like. I'm talking about their cellular structure. I'm not talking about what they look like. I'm talking about their cellular structure. Capiche? Which they are. So you do. So then you actually believe their claims such as that emergency contraception, the Pill, Depo-Provera , and Norplant   are unsafe abortifacients and abortion causes breast cancer and severe psychological trauma? Have you actually researched the validity ( lack thereof in this case ) of these claims?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>That doesn't matter. The infant doesn't have sperm, does that mean it doesn't have a right to live? The infant only weights about 7 lbs, verses an adult who weighs around 130. Does that mean it doesn't have rights either? Genetically, Down's syndrome patients are corrupt - they have too many or too little chromosones. Do they not have rights to life either? I mean, our cellular structure is ALWAYS different in the cycle of life, and further some defected humans have different cellular structures as well, does that mean that we can kill people of ONE kind of these structures? Well, I don't know too much about it, but I've heard that it does, though I also heard on the news last year that these were proven false, but only one aspect. From my understanding, the reason why abortion is dangerous is that you're prematurly opening the uterus to get the fetus ou and kill it, and the body is already on a 9 - month cycle to take care of the fetus, and when you suddenly stop it like that it causes problems - just like premature births. I don't know too much about it though. Why are you asking me this?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I can't find law that states this to be true. Since it is a legal right can you post a law or something that shows this... even a court case would be ok. I have been looking for an hour now and I am getting kinda frustrated.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Are you serious? Perhaps you can tell me where my examples are incorrect? Perhaps you can provide statutes, precedents, court cases, rationale or sense that would show otherwise? I will look around and find relevant laws when I have the time. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No, I want a law that says someone has the right to abortion. I don't have to prove one doesn't exist as the burden of proof is on you. Now I asked a simple question so can you find me one or not?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Except in cases of common knowledge, then you must provide differently. It is common knowledge that we have the right to our organs because consent is required before they are harvested. I have answered your question before, yet you keep asking it. Did you simply not understand? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If you have answered it then please refer to it. Common knowledge is not law by the way. You clearly said a LEGAL right. In fact, I am not even saying a law or court case is not out there... I just wanna see one ( however, there is an odd case about not having an absolute right to your own resources ). So I ask for the third time... where is this legal right? I would even be happy with link to another post. No international law please and no ' implied ' rights as this would be begging the question ( since we all love the fallacies ).<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I did not say common knowledge was law, I said if something is common knowledge there is no burden of proof. The burden of proof is then on the one denying it. The legal right is in the fact that it cannot be restricted. If there is no law preventing you from doing something, you cannot be legally stopped. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I can't show you every law to show you it is not in there... I was asking for a law that shows that. If this right was " legal " then it would be a written law for one. Also, one would be able to use drugs on their own body because one would have the right to their own body. So I am not sure this law legally does exist. I just wanna know where it is if there is a law.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Nor can I show you every law to show you that you have the right to your own body. You can, however, show a law or case or precedent showing where the right to one's organs and life-processes is limited. Not so. As in the Constitution, any powers not specifically limited to the Federal Gov't belong to us. They don't need to be specified. Again, you misrepresent what the pro-choice argument is. It is a desire to prevent something from happening to ones body, not to use it in anything a woman desires. A similar argument would be to refuse drugs that would save ones own life.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>So am I then to assume you cannot answer my questions, or that you cannot express those answers in english?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I have answered your questions over and over again when it comes to abortion....... To bad it is has blinded you to the fate of the innocent........ I have a feeeling you are one of these liberals who have no compassion for a baby in the womb but when it comes to a murderer or rapist scheduled to be executed you are filled with compassion for them............... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I'm sorry, but I cannot find the answers to the following questions from my previous posts : 1. Why do you, Voice of Reason, characterize women's decisions to have abortions as ' arbitrary '? 2. In the absence of anyone being able to make an inference to the effect that more child abandonment happens because we hear about it more often, how else might you, Voice of Reason, justify the claim that infant abandonment is happening more often? Could you please help me find them, or perhaps even repeat your answer so it is clear?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>1. I think a lot of women take take the easy way out when it comes to and abortion for the reasons I have stated over and over again.......... 2. What I said was it seems you can't pick up the newspaper these days and not see a case of where some woman has abandoned a new born baby in a trash can or dumpster....... It never use to be that way.......... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So you argue that for some women, abortion is the " easy way out ", and that those women choose to abort, take the easy way out as you say, for arbitrary reasons? Could you please reiterate these reasons here ( preferably in an enumerated list ) and explain why they should be considered arbitrary? Indeed. But we've established that supposing a higher profile in the media in no way entails an actual increase in incidents. So I'll repeat the question, hearsay aside, upon what evidence do you base the assertion that more women are abandoning infants?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>All I have to go by is what I hear in the news media and if you think that 40,000,000 babies murdered in the womb in this country since 1972 is nothing then I feel sorry for you........ Oh and I am not going to say again what the frivelous reasons a lot of women have abortions here in the U.S. Instead of just attacking me take the time to go back and read the thread............... You might lear something......... Probably not though.......... <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Surely there are public records and official statistics kept so that you can verify the numbers you hear in the media? Given the media's liberal bias, how do you know that number is accurate? I don't know whether there were less or more abortion procedures than the 40,000,000 that you quote. That's what I think we need to corroborate. Also, when you say " this country " I'm going to assume you mean the USA. I'm from Canada and our abortion rate is somewhat different from yours. According to your government, specifically their CDC agency, the rate of abortions is dropping. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5404a6.htm http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5309a1.htm Given the size of your country and your rates of abortion, despite the recent decline, 40,000,000 strikes me as a low number I'm not trying to attack you. I did take the time to go through the thread. Unfortunately I can't find the reasons that you cite, which is why I asked you to repost them so we could discuss them. Again, could you please repost the list of reasons that you claim are frivolous or direct me to the posts in which you posted those reasons?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Sigma is a person without compassion for the innocent defenseless infant in the womb.............. It is so sad that are such heartless people in this country........ He will answer for his belief on judgement day..........<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You can, but there is little point. Should I feel compassion for a man forced to watch horrible images if he is blind? I can, but there is little point. He? Who says I am male? What is in the womb is not an ' infant ' ( your overly emotional non-argument nonwithstanding ). I do have compassion... for the woman. " outraged that the human race allows it to continue "? No, not really. I understand what motivates people. There are certain things that I feel are disgusting and would stop if I were able to. I don't think there is one thing I am passionate about over all else, but this issue does rank above many others. I feel disgusted that there are those who would make women second class citizens. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I know of no one that wants to make women a second class cititzen....... I know I sure don't............ I just want and infant in the womb to have the same chance at life that you and I had......... It is my hope that before I die that I see the barbaric act of legaling killing babies in the womb, Rowe V Wade overturned and give the decision on abortion back to individual state so that all these beautiful babies. gifts from God hve a chance at life...........<br><b> S2:2-  </b>These " infants " do. My mother could have aborted me and she chose to have me. And if the state decides to keep abortion legal? Then you don't care if these " gifts from God " have a chance or not? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I know one thing for sure if you kill them in the womb they have no chance....... I would think they would want the same chance you and I had......... I don't know about you but after being married for almost 40 years with 6 kids and 10 grandchildren I turned out all right........<br><b> S2:3-  </b>haha! I think you need to re-examine the bolded parts ;) I don't believe I've ever characterized what is inside the woman as " a glob of cells ". You go ahead and assume about me, it makes it all the easier to dismiss you as irrelevent :) <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You don't have to come out and say it........ All one needs to do is read you comments that show your disdain for the innocent, defenseless unborn inthe womb...... Only in your mixed up mind my friend..........<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Truly? What comments have I said that " show my disdain ( sic ) "? Could you post a few? I'm not your friend :P<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The last sentence was pompous, ridiculous and without any foundation. As you friend Simone might and probably would say.. prove it.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>OK. How many infants or children have you adopted or taken in ON YOUR OWN DIME? A number will suffice. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Iam in the fortunate position not to have had to do it. If my brother, sister or thier children needed a home I would accept them in a heartbeat. Also I would do it without feeling the need to exhibit any moral superiority as you seem to be doing, albeit by proxy.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Nope, simply speaking as one who has been there and done that. :) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Haven't we all. The difference is some of us know that most people have or will and that it does not make us a fount of knowledge. As you show us so well.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Really. You said jus a few posts ago that you had not adopted any children. Were you " misspeaking " then, or are you " misspeaking " now? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>BTW, my wife's brother is dying of cancer. He has a 17 - year old son whose mother died when this boy was a toddler. One of my wife's sisters and her husband have told her brother, " We will take the boy in and love him as our own. " This was part of your post. It would seem that you are basking in someones elses glory! Or will you now invent an adoption of your own to make up for it. Been there and done that? It doesn't show<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Nice try, but the question was about YOU. BTW, my adopted son is now 37 - years old, so the question remains. If you care to check, that's the year RvW came down. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>No the question was about you! By the way have I told you about my Granma who joined the foreign<br><b> S2:5-  </b>That must make her tougher than shoe leather. You go, girl. Now, the question still remains for you and the other restrictionists here. Have you adopted any of the " babies " you fought so hard to save when they were fetuses, or does your concern for them end at their birth or with you throwing a few coins their way? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>No the question remains that when challenged for questioning someones intergrity, you cited someone elses selfless deed to qualify yourself to ask the question. When this was pointed out you asked me whether I had done the same thing as this other person. When it was pointed out that YOU were basking in anothers glory it transpires that you had done the very same thing. You may be showing signs of being a keyboard hero. Unlike my Grandmother of course.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>My adopted 37 - year old son might just have a difference of opinion with you, silly woman. Now, how many of the " babies " that YOU fought to save when they were nothing but fetuses have you adopted once they were born, or does your concern for the little dears end with their birth. Or are you, like AO, content to throw a few coins their way and consider your moral obligation complete? Next time, get your facts straight. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>What facts? Your adopted 37 year old son is as real as my foreign legionnaire grandmother! Your argument that I should adopt the fetus that I save is as valid as an argument that I should fund the dialysis of a person with a damaged kidney! BTW you are a silly woman too!<br><b> S2:7-  </b>I hope the old gal is doing well. I hear that the training puts our Seals to shame. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>I never really liked seals, They cant juggle footballs and play horns like sea lions. Actually she smells a little bit like a sea lion.....<br><b>S1:1-  </b>If I also misinterpreted the gist of Phyllis's sarcasm, then I apologize to her. And I agree with you assessment of the situation as stated in the article.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I perceive that you are a new poster here, which is bound to happen. This necessarily means that it is unlikely that you know my views, which is understandable. I am pro-life. You need not take my word for that ; you need only read some of my past postings, or ask anyone who has frequented the forums before. Though I am happy you realized my sarcastic tone, I can't pretend I'm not disappointed given all my past discussions on this topic in which you have participated. I should have thought my pro life views were well established. Consider, for example, the following exchanges when I critiqued your view because it was not pro-life enough : 1, 2, 3. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Hi Phyllis, excuse my confusion, The last thing I want to do is marginalize or antagonize an ally. One piece of advice though, in case you're not aware of it ; at the top right corner of each post you want to quote is a permalink. If you copy that and past it to the post, the intended post will appear when clicked on. What you have done is posted complete threads which must be waded through to find the intended post. And depending on the thread and poster, determining that might be difficult or impossible. Just so you know for future reference.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Each of the links I posted point right to the intended post within the context of the entire thread. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Forgive my confusion, but I can't find your criticisms of me in these links. Maybe you can at least tell me the post number in each link that I should go to because I'm interested in reading them. All three links open to post 41, on my computer.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Here are the individual posts I linked : 1, 2, 3. If that doesn't work, nothing will.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>There's a reason why they're called morning after pills. They must be taken as soon as possible. Denying any woman -- especially a rural woman -- that cushion of time is unthinkable IMO. I mean, she's already had to see a doctor, who has made an educated decision about what's best for the woman. And, oddly enough, the morning after pill in no way causes an abortion. It prevents a pregnancy, not unlike birth control pills, which they are. I think there's a huge difference between a pharmacy offering products for sale and the pharmacists refusing to sell them, and a store deciding not to stock certain items.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I suggest you re-read things on the morning after pill.... It will do three things ; prevent the sperm from reaching the egg, stop the release of the egg, of if the egg is fertiziled it will keep it from attaching. The third is an abortion. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Well, if that is your definition of abortion we don't have much to discuss. Oddly, delaying a woman her right to morning after pills makes option three more likely, doesn't it? Shouldn't we be doing all we can to make sure she receives her legal prescription without delay? What good does it do a pharmacist to glare at her when time is of the essence? Shouldn't we be truly happy that abortions are down over 10 percent in the last decade in part because morning after pills have become available?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>yeeeeeah, once again, it is an abortion... and a forced one at that. abortion really just means the ending of a pregnancy, however, for what we use it for it really kinda means the unnatural ending of a pregnancy. So for those that believe life begins at conception then the morning after pill would be the killing of a human life and thus that person would believe it to be wrong. Whether it is killed 1 day after or 5 months after is irrelevant as it is the same result. So for the pharmacist that believes abortion to be murder, he would not prescribe it. so abortions aren't down 10 percent... just abortions at clinics are... not only that, I don't believe abortions have gone down that much <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Like I said, we don't have much to discuss, especially since you didn't answer my questions.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>oh they were answered... but if you wish me to rephrase... No, as they are not options.. it does them all. Either way, since the pharamcist doesn't know, it still might be an abortion. No, once again, if it kills a person then that kinda defeats the purpose of a pharmacists ( assuming the pharamacist is pro-life ) What's done is done... only thing the pharmacist can do is have a chance at killing a human. You seem to be missing the point with all of these. The pharamicists that don't believe in the morning after pill think it might give the women an abortion and thus don't want to take the chance of being morally responsible for the death of another. Same reason Wal-Mart doesn't sell certain CDs and Magazines.. they don't want to be a part of that. Already answered. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>It's you who's missing the point -- two of them. By witholding a legal prescription from a woman, a pharmacist is greatly increasing the chance that the woman does indeed become pregnant, with the remedy becoming a clinical abortion. All his high and mighty " principles " are accomplishing is to increase the number of abortions needed. Second, Wal-Mart can decline to sell anything, at anytime and anywhere it so wishes. I don't know how to make that any clearer, but if I need to continue to stress that red herring, I will. If you are an employee your moral responsibility is to not work for the company if you disagree with their policies or with what they sell, not to discriminate against its customers. What kind of a lily-livered movement is this? Pharmacists pretending to stand firm in their personal convictions, with the only result being an increase in the behavior they claim to be against, but unwilling to do the right, principled thing : quit. It's called grandstanding, and it comes at the expense of a frightened woman in need.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>So a pharamicist that is running is own shop would be ok to do it then. Haven't I said this the whole time? If Walgreens says " you have to sell what the customer wants " then if the pharamcists doesn't do it then they should be able to fire them for not doing their job. If the Walgreens says " it is up to the best judgement of the pharamicist " then I see no problem with him / her refusing to serve. When I was working at a gas station some years ago I could refuse to sell cigarettes to people over 18 if I wanted. It would be the women getting the abortion though and not the pharmacist wouldn't have " blood " on his hands. Remember, the morning after pill still can abort and really that is the main point.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>no, there are more... it kind of goes in a pattern. It will soon turn to how the womens rights are all above the unborns. From there we will go to " well, no one has a right to life... personal autonomy is real right ". And then there will be some random arguement that differences everytimes... and then back to " the unborn is not a person / human ". And then we loop around again. Meanwhile the pro-life position remains the same throughout this process. The unborn has a right to live period end of story. So the pro-choice will try to rationalize all day long but in the end the truth shows that abortion is murder. So do you wish to be pro-choice and try to make the truth be your slave or would you rather be a slave to the truth?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>A great many fertilized human eggs fail to make it to term because they fail to implant themselves in the walls of the womb to plug into the nourishment provided by a woman's body, the nourishment and connection necessary for a pregnancy to proceed. These many deaths of these little fertilized human eggs, DNA for a totally new human, in other words, a human being according to your definition, Steeeeve, are they murders? The little fertilized egg that is flushed out with menstrual blood onto a tampon or sanitary napkin with a woman's monthly menstrual period, should there be a funeral conducted for these little beings? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>you assume that the lady knows she is pregnant...<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But, Steeeeve, considering the preciousness of the little being, even if a woman has no idea if she's pregnant, isn't it vitally important to hold a little funeral for all the soiled tampons and menstrual napkins just in case there is a sacred, precious little being therein? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I feel a strawman arguement coming up... A funeral is not a determining factor on whether or not something is human, a person, or anything. People have funerals for loving an arm you know. So yeah, if you wanna be on the safe side then have a funeral I don't care<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But, if the pweshious widdo being is a human, shouldn't that pweshious widdo being have a funeral? Even if one cannot even see the pweshious widdo being to be sure that a pweshious widdo being is there? If not, how can the life of pweshious widdo beings have any meaning? I mean, if the Roman Catholic Church has declared in all its Holiness that the meeting of a human sperm and human egg creates a pweshious new widdo human being right there on the spot. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So your stance would be that what the mother wants is all that matters? You being a smart a $$ is not needed on these forums. If you wish to act like a child go to Disney World.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Altruism = unselfish concern for others. Strictly speaking, I think that anything a human chooses to do is done in that human's self-interest. If I have concern for others, it is because I have been in that place and I hope that if I were in that place again others would have concern for me. If, on occasion, I can leap the bounds of my experience and have concern for others who are in situations that I have never suffered it is because I would never like to be in the same situation and, again, I would hope that others would, likewise, be concerned about my situation should it be my fate to suffer such a state. I see absolutely nothing at all wrong with self-interest if it does not oppress the self-interests of others unless those others are oppressing the self-interests of others. And, furthermore, I think I might start a School of New Philosophy based on the righteousness of self-interest.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So you only concern yourself with persons in a condition where you may one day find yourself in, because if you help them then somebody might help you also one day. Well, it doesn    t follow that because you help somebody that person will return you the favor. Also you wouldn    t help animals with which you can not identify and of course can never help you in return. If you ever found a school of ethics based on these principles you can for sure count me out. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You raise an interesting point, Winston Smith. However, I do help animals and I do get a payback. I FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHAT I DID. Ergo, I did it in my self-interest. In regard to helping someone who will never pay me back, likely, I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT TOO. Ergo, again I act in my self-interest. I also do an act for a human with the hope that, even if that particular human does not pay me back, another human might see my situation, take pity upon me and render unto me what I rendered to the original person in this scenario -- BECAUSE A PRECEDENT OF DECENT BEHAVIOR HAS BEEN SET. Ergo, my payback. Understand?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>How can this good Samaritan that comes to your help possibly know that once Simone helped somebody in the same predicament and therefore set a precedent and a compulsory precedent by the way, therefore the good Samaritan has to help you. What nonsense is this? What if the good Samaritan says    I already got enough    feel good paybacks    for today, and I am feeling pretty good already, so sorry Simone and good bye    Understand?? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Does a quick statistical calculation, using various factors culled from around the universe. Hmm, sorry, W Smith, that is not likely to happen and I'll take my chances on the small odds. The odds are very much greater that it will. This is the way, in the Universe of Good Will, that precedents of goodness proceed. It takes a great deal of negative will and evil to upset such precedents. All though, to be sure, circumstances occur in which such things happen -- witness Hitler in Nazi Germany, desperate times in which people quashed the good feelings that occur after doing a good deed. Heed the teachings of the Dalai Lama and let bliss descend upon you! The bliss of being good!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Now I see that your position has evolved from : altruism doesn    t exist because people    profit    from altruistic acts, therefore altruists acts are really selfish acts, and I don    t want to go back to that debate, to the new position that there seems to be some sort of universal goodness reservoir that impels people to do good acts, so altruism does exist after all? So far as I know the Indians believe that the amount of Good is always equal to the amount of Evil in the world therefore any    evil    action creates and equal and opposite    good    action to keep the balance. So going back to your example of Hitler, whatever evil he did, and he did plenty, was compensated by other people doing good. In other words Hitler indirectly did a lot of good. Great isn    t? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Actually, I made reference to Buddhist beliefs rather than Hindu beliefs about the balance of Karma. I find no sensible reason for believing in a balance between GOOD and EVIL. There is GOOD. There is EVIL. We humans are free to choose between the two. I choose, when I am aware of the result of my act being good or evil, to do that which causes good simply because, to quote Martha Stewart, " It's a good thing " to do and it makes me feel good. My payback. Hopefully there is more good than evil in the world. That would make me feel very good!<br><b>S1:1-  </b>[ QUOTE = Sigma ] heh I see you edited your post ;) So it's never justified to kill another human? [ / QUOTE It's only justified if your defending yourselve and death is the only choice to save your own life. For example, say a women has cancer and when it would be treated it would kill the baby. Usually the mother waits until the baby is born to treat it, but by then their cancer may beyond being treated. Or someone is reaching for knife to kill you and you have a gun so you shoot him. That is justifiable. Killing it because you don't want to go through with the pregnancy is stupid. The baby is innocent, it is not threatening your life at all. Killing the baby would be evil anyway.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Evil even if it is to save her own life? What if she is taking medication for her severe depression ( suicidal tendencies ), but that medication would cause the fetus to be fatally deformed and almost guaranteed to cause a miscarriage? On one hand, is it right to legally force her to continue a pregnancy that she knows won't be complete, or force her to go off the medication that makes her able to function in life? Evil? Forcing either of these by law is evil and oppressive. Perhaps your option is to take her off the medication and lock her up until the thing you're really concerned about is born. I like how at first murder is never justified, then it's killing is never justified, now it's only some killing is justified. I happen to think an abortion is justified killing. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Didn't you read what I just said. It is not bad or evil to kill the baby if the baby is threatening your own life.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Why though? It is a human, it can think, it is not its fault that it is there! Why should we be allowed to kill an innocent human who is not at fault for this? Why should the woman be allowed to play god and kill a creature that has done her no harm? It is not its fault that the pregnancy might kill her. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>What I meant was, if the mother was to go through with the pregnancy, knowing that it would kill her and the baby, then, and pretty much only then, could the mother use abortion.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Why should she even do it then? Why should she be allowed to kill a person that is not threatening her life on purpose? Is it its fault that the pregnancy is killing her? Shouldn't she be a good mother and sacrifice herself if it gives the fetus even a chance at life? I mean, after all, it isn't her body, so why should she be able to control what happens to the fetus like that? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Um... if the fetus was going to die and kill the mother if she continued the pregnancy, then both of them would die. Then you would only be able to safe the mother. If the doctors knew the fetus was going to die and bring the mother with him / her then you would safe the mother using abortion. The baby should also be druged so ti could not feel the pain. Perhaps I was not clear enough or you misread the post.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>So we are under no moral obligation to allow the fetus to live as long as it would naturally live? Are we under a moral obligation to allow it to live if birthing would kill the mother, but it could survive for a few days outside the womb? A few weeks? A month? At what point do we allow it to live, but kill the mother? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>If the baby was doomed to die anyway, then killing it to save the mother would be okay. But the clinic should give it plenty of pain killer. hmm... mabye they should just overdose it with painkiller.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>We're all doomed to die :P The question is how long we live. How long must the baby be able to live outside the womb before we don't allow abortion ( whether or not it kills the mother )? If it can only survive a day, is abortion still allowed? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Let it live as long as it can. And when doctors are sure that it is going to die say in a few days or weeks, give it an overdose of painkiller.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>One possible choice was left out of the original decision. If I recall the lifeboat question, it was possible to chose one's self for water treading duty. Therefore, the correct moral response to the original question would be : Kill the zygote. Suicide is a sin.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Suicide may be but sacrific isn't. Choosing your own life to save another is sacrific :) <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Choosing to sacrifice myself instead of one of two children, teens, or younger adults would be doable. Posed the original question, the zygote dies. Would you sacrifice your own life for a zygote? Suppose, for a second, that the decision is either one of two zygotes, or youself? Should I ever decide to sacrifice my own life, so that a couple of zygotes may live, please don't tell my friends.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>would you choose to kill three strangers to save your mother ( assume they are unrelated parties ) The idea that you would pick one over another doesn't prove abortion is ok nor does it prove abortion isn't ok. I for one will not choose which life lives or dies... lets hope I am never in that situation though :) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You didn't answer my question. Would you sacrifice yourself to save a zygote? I'll answer your's. Yes.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I see what you are saying now. I don't place one worth over another.. however, in these kinds of situations I doubt I would have the capacity to think as I am right now... in fact, I doubt many would. So I must say I don't know because I have never been in that position. I'm sure even you would like to say that you believe your mom and the person next to her have equal rights are should be the same... but those situations produce rather odd results. I don't know if I would or not. I think that might get into a religious aspect with me ;). As for the post above this one.... you could go on with this example and say " what if you knew the zygote would cure cancer " and random stuff like that. In the end, this doesn't relate too much with abortion ;)<br><b>S1:1-  </b>LOL, something must've got cut off. I think it was maybe that they don't want to ask about the details, with ignorance being bliss and all-makes an abortion much easier if you don't have to hear all the gory details<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You really gotta work on those quote tags, Syklopps. Dude, I have no clue what you're talking about. It's true, disturbing is in the eye of the beholder. You're causing them emotional distress deliberately for the sadistic glee of it I guess, since you know it will be disturbing to them. If it's legal to do, then it's your right, even if I think you're wrong. Necessity varies from person to person. Who are you to judge what is necessary for each and every woman? Forgive me, I thought you believed PP was promoting abortions so they could price gouge. I guess you don't believe that :P For the cause? I suppose you could say that... they provide a medical procedure desired by many women around the country and around the world. The provide counceling referrals, if needed, and encourage women to talk to people they trust first. It is not needed in many cases. I cloud the issue?! You brought it up! At least lose gracefully. If I attributed comments to you, I apologize. Don't want you getting credit for JP ;) <br><b>S1:2-  </b>. LMAO, at this point, neither do I, but there HAD to be a brilliant point in there somewhere LOL You said this : [ QUOTE ] Quote : And I responded with this : It looks like I was referring to the fact that many women don't WANT to face the facts and simply find comfort and reassurance with those who pat her on her back for a job well done Not for the sadistic glee in the least, merely to have the light of truth shine upon them Well, it IS done everyday for people, even MEN. In MOST cases of abortion, the doctor doesn't sit down with a woman and tell her that she MUST have the abortion or else, therefore the judgment of whether it is or isn't a necessity isn't MINE, but a doctor's, and most abortions just aren't LOL, NOW NOW, if you have a point I eagerly point it out, so I would consider that losing with an excess of grace actually :-P<br><b> S2:2-  </b>hehe, always ;) Or perhaps it's akin to a woman giving birth to a stillborn baby and not wanting too look at it, or a woman who know's she is giving the baby up for adoption not wanting to look at it. It is something that is very emotional, and something that would make that harder to bear is not something she want's to go through. I don't believe it's " not facing facts ". They can know the truth without you trying to scare and emotionally tramautize them. You're almost there! :D Just change a little "... whether it is or isn't a necessity isn't MINE, but between a doctor and the woman... " Ok :) Just sorta hit me the wrong way <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Well, looking at it from a taking a life perspective ( and you have agreed that the fetus IS a life ) - it's much easier for me to kill a person if I don't have to look them in the eye, so yes, the emotion that occurs that could stop you from taking a life is probably a good thing LMAO don't hold your breath :p The fact still remains that in MOST cases it's NOT necessary for the mother to abort ( necessary in terms of life threatening ) [ / QUOTE ] No sweat, but I can assure you that IF you ever " get " me, I'll give you all the credit you deserve :-D<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are free to believe that. I'm not sure if you are agreeing that you should not be allowed to cause emotional distress or if you're being sarcastic, so I guess I won't take this further :P Nuts ;) Guess it was too much to hope for that you'd see it my way. Well, at least you agreed that laws shouldn't decide it, but on an individual basis. Now all we have to do is agree on what " life threatening " ( ie, necessary ) is. Is it only her death that makes it legal, or is significant health risk enough? Is above 50% chance of death enough to make it legal, or is it only certain death? Is mental health an issue? There is medication that woman take for different mental health conditions that can almost guarantee a serious deformity in a fetus. Can a woman get an abortion for chemotherapy ( since the fetus cannot survive the procedure ), even if the cancer won't kill for many years? All I can ask for :) Maximus, I've sorta lost the thread of what we were discussing. I'm sorry if there was anything I had not addressed that you want me to address. If you include them when you post, I'll give you my thoughts :)<br><b>S1:1-  </b>And with the president's new law there is no debate. It is illegal to have an abortion at that late stage unless the mother is at risk.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That works for me. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Agreed. However it already pretty much worked that way for most doctors anyway. Law felt more like a door opener anyway - a foot in for stricter legislation. And it does bug me to no end that he signed that thing without a woman in sight. Speaks volumes as to his attitude about what voice women should have in their pregnancies. Schmuck.... ( I really don't like our president much...... )<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I'm a firm believer that you can tell a lot about how a man views women by how he treats his wife. That said, contrast GW with Slick Willy and you'll see that GW is very respectful of Laura Bush while Clinton behaved the exact opposite with Hillary. He cheated on her under her nose and forced her to defend his indiscretions in public. In Kerry's case, it appears that his wife wears the pants in the family in addition to carrying the family's wallet. ;) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Granted I would not want to meet Clinton in a sleazy bar..... However, when faced with this same issue he actually talked to women and doctors rather than religious leaders. Plus Bush is unforgiven by me because of the Patriot Act. However - kudos to BOTH of them for their efforts towards the AIDS crisis in Africa. ROCK!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Are you sure he was " consulting " with the women and not just hitting on them? :) I shudder to think what it would have looked like if the Dems were in charge. Remember the Japanese Interment Camps in California from the FDR Years? Very sad state of affairs indeed. I wouldn't be as moved if their plight wasn't largely due to contaminated blood supply but rather unsafe sex.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>How in the world do doctors benefit from an abortion?......<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You gest, right? How much does an abortionist make for NOT performing an abortion? ZERO! I don't know how much he makes for performing one, but it's probably enough to keep him in nice cars and fine wine. :) ROFLMAO! Abortionists are such " caring people "..... LOL...... Have you ever read the bio on Planned Parenthood's founder, Margaret Sanger? Here's the geneology of your fine, upstanding Planned Parenthood : http://blackgenocide.org/sanger.html http://www.spectacle.org/997/richmond.html http://www.pro-life.net/sanger/ Here's a sample of one of the goals of her ABCL, PP's precursor : " EDUCATIONAL : The program of education includes : The enlightenment of the public at large, mainly through the education of leaders of thought and opinion -- teachers, ministers, editors and writers -- to the moral and scientific soundness of the principles of Birth Control and the imperative necessity of its adoption as the basis of national and racial progress. " Couched racism is still racism.... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Neg, I do not jest in this. " abortionist "? Is that a word? I prefer to call them " doctors " Yes, believe it or not, even those who perform abortions can be caring people, as much so as you pro-life people. Believe it or not, I am a caring person and I love my parents and my SO. Because I am pro-choice does not make me a demon worshipper or a serial rapist or anything like that. Says the man who advocates blowing up hospitals and shooting doctors who perform abortions. Since, after all, any who are part of your cause automatically makes up all of you<br><b> S2:2-  </b>There's a big difference. Sanger FOUNDED PP. If anyone typified the membership, it'd be the founder, wouldn't you think? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I would if you could show that those beliefs affected the day-to-day operation of PP, or if PP espoused those beliefs. Otherwise they're just beliefs of a single person. Do you truly believe that people with questional beliefs didn't participate in good things?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>This one cracks me up. http://www.plannedparenthood.org/lib...IABCENTERS.HTM This one is disturbing : http://www.childpredators.com/ Silly me, how could I ever question the pure motives of a group that wants nothing more than to rip fetuses from their mothers ' wombs. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Does me too, but probably for another reason ;) Disturbing, how so? Ah, linguistic revisionist :) If you have to resort to emotional blackmail to make your point, then it shows your arguments cannot stand on their own. They allow women to stop a pregnancy they do not want. I consider that a good cause. Better than a group that wants to force motherhood on unwilling victims, not caring if they are unable to physically, financially, emotionally or mentally. Very uncaring, if you ask me. ;)<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Are you serious? The fact that PP covers up crimes against minors doesn't bother you? http://www.clinicworker.com/LegalTrouble.html#naf http://www.childpredators.com/CoverUp.cfm http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/ar...TICLE_ID=28154 http://www.christiangallery.com/11thcircuitPP.htm Linguistic revisionist?! I could have said " ripped a baby from its mother's womb " but I chose " fetus " instead. It was an accurate description of the practice of abortion. I'm sorry if you find it offensive ; I find abortion offensive and trying to sugar-coat the process with acronyms misleading. It's not a pregnancy termination, Dusting and Cleaning ( D & C ), D & E or MVA. It's the forcable removal of a living fetus from its mother's womb. Period. At least have the intellectual honesty to call a " spade " a " spade ". In China, they kill unwanted daughters because they are only allowed to have one child. Do you condone this practice? After all, they are only doing so because they can't afford to support more than one child. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I never said that. I was waiting for you to include your conclusions. You posted the links then kinda left it :P " Ripped a fetus from it's mother's womb " is inaccurate when describing abortions. There are many different procedures, some even non-surgical, that wouldn't even come close to anything like that. To use that phrase to describe all abortion is purely emotional blackmail and completely inaccurate. That's what I find offensive. And do you think this practise is better than getting an abortion? Is abortion illegal there? Perhaps the woman should abort as soon as she knows she is pregnant.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I didn't realize that I needed to spoonfeed the conclusion. Wasn't it obvious? Did I say that it represented " ALL abortions "? Don't try to put words in my mouth ; I'm quite capable of doing that myself, thank you. :) What's this sound like to you? Would you have preferred if I had said " the fetus is sucked from the mother's womb " instead? Here's an interesting fact that I found on PP's website : After 20 weeks gestation there is no statistically significant difference in maternal mortality rates between terminating a pregnancy by abortion and carrying it to term ( Paul et al., 1999 ). To me, that seems to bring into question the theory that late-term abortions are performed to save the mother's life. The fact is that the mortality rate is the same as going full-term. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>If you want to discuss just the websites, start a new thread. If it is relavent to what we are discussing, draw a conclusion that relates to what we are saying from the sites. That's what you do during a debate :) By stating " how could I ever question the pure motives of a group that wants nothing more than to rip fetuses from their mothers ' wombs " you imply that's what an abortion is, and just now you admitted that's not what happens during an abortion. You also said : Which is certainly stating what you think abortion ( all abortion ) is. It would be helpful if you are clear with what you say in the first place so I do not have to " put words in your mouth ". When refering to those methods, the above would be much more accurate, but still incomplete. To me, it seems that you do admit that there is a mortality rate for carrying the fetus to term :) Therefore there are times that abortion can save the mother ;) As with any surgical procedure, there is risk :( As long as the mother is willing to undertake that risk and we do all we can to make that procedure safe, that's all we can do.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I always thought the " inability to survive on its own " idea was a lame argument used by pro-abortionists, but its not that way for all of them. The others will say this when they are confronted by someone who believes a baby ( however young ) has the right to live from birth as a means to draw away from the facts and confuse the pro-lifer. They lead you into arguements about how old a baby has to be to be worthy of rights, what it requires, does it require consciousness and a means to feel pain in order to make what they're doing wrong and so on and so on. It leads you round and round until suddenly you're being attacked in the debate instead of you the pro-abortionist by your idea of life beginning at conception. This has happened to me several times, and I've lost my mind with it. So not only do I believe this arguement to be lame, it is also a trap to confuse the pro-lifer with issues that are meaningless if they truly believe life begins at conception.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Rather than complaining about what " they " do, why don't you make a point? I am not sure what yours is here. I thought you went home. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>My point was to show what I thought of pro-abortionist's reasons for bringing up the arguement of independant survival for reasons other than being lame at debating. Look at my post for Sinjin.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well could you please explain it again, because I don't understand what you were saying? I don't even understand the current comment. Thanks. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Fine. There have been two reasons ( I've seen so far ) that pro-abortionists have for using the " independant survival " arguement. 1. Because they can't think of anything else to say and end up sounding ridiculous. 2. Because they are confronted by a pro-lifer who believes a baby is a baby with rights from the moment of conception. They can't get through that wall, so they bring up technicalities like not having a conscience or a brain or senses. They do this to confuse the person and then challenge them on their scientific knowledge of the human anatomy and its growth. By then, the pro-lifer who is attacking the pro-abortionist is suddenly on the defense because their field in science may be limited compared to the pro-abortionist. Whether or not the pro-abortionist is really as smart as he / she claims. And with the pro-lifer looking stupid, objective viewers will begin to think the pro-abortionist is right. It's a clever weapon, but all the pro-lifer has to do is laugh and ignore it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>OK. Let's see if I have this correct. In your view, persons who have a different opinion than you on this abortion debate in a forum on abortion, simply have no valid argument and are simply " wrong ". ( This is called keeping an open mind, I suppose. ) If they discuss the scientific or medical aspects of this medical condition callled pregnancy, they do so only to confuse people like you who don't know enough to discuss the scientific / medical aspects. I say with all the respect your post deserves, that is a rather childish approach to debate and to life. You might consider that not knowing something ( this is called ignorance, a word that you use, in my opinion, frequently incorrectly ) is a potential learning opportunity. What is the point of being in this forum, if you have this opinion? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Uh-uh, we are talking about one specific argument here. Not all of them. That applies to everything I said here. And to make the pro-lifer look dumb in the process, making the objective viewer to take what seems to be the smartest side. That's the only motive I see behind the " independant survival " arugement. Other times I can't tell if that is really what they believe or not. Oh, I came here to learn. And I've learned a lot concerning both sides of the abortion controversy.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>How do you make someone " look dumb " if they are not? An " objective " observer would not " take the side " of what seems to be. That would not be objective. If one happens to have factual information about a topic, that doesn't make them " smart ", that makes them informed. Are you saying a lack of knowledge about a topic is in some way desirable or admirable? And how can one intelligently debate without all the facts? I guess you would have to debate solely on uninformed opinions or what someone else told you. Your comments above belie that position. It seems you come here to parrot what your momma told you. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Even if they are just informed, an objective viewer, or I should say : an objective viewer with the same amount of knowledge on the un-informed pro-lifer will think that the pro-abortionist is smarter and knows more and may even begin to believe the pro-abortionist is right. The same thing happened between someone who debated Thomas Huxley on the issue of evolution. I can't remember the anti-evolution guy's name, but he didn't know as much about science as Thomas Huxley and the majority of the people believe Thomas. Not necessarily because Thomas was right, but because he sounded smarter. That is how things work. You would. And it is more convincing.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Oh my. How can I put this? That is a staggeringly inane comment. I don't know where to begin. I actually gasped when I read it. You are very confused, it seems. You appear to eshcew - or worse fear - learning new things. Just because someone has statements of apparent fact you have never heard before, it doesn't make that person smarter, it doesn't make the facts accurate and it doesn't make a valid argument. You have to think in life. You are saying that the other guy is simply " wrong " no matter what. He has no possible argument so makes up (?? ) stuff to confuse the uninformed. Although you are not aware of the facts of his argument, you are certain they are false, but you feel no compunction to verify the facts, you simply dismiss them, for if they were true they might weaken your argument. This is no way to go through life, boy. Uniformed is not a good way to be.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>And I would say that they must not be very Christian to do so. Now, your credibility is really taking a hit. We don't live in the age of the Scarlet Letter. No women are ostricized or banished because they have morally slipped. Where do you get these absurd ideas? How about some examples that demonstrate the differences? I don't know anything about tribal Scandanavian rules of conduct and would like to hear about them.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And I would say that you must not be very Christian to want to enslave women. So we have opinions about how " Christian " others are, based on their politics. Isn't that special! <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Abortion isn't just a political issue. It's a moral issue, so why are you surprised that a Christian would take the moral, pro-life position?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Actually, the prolife amoral position of enslaving women is not particularly Christian. The Christian prochoice position of seeing the woman as a person in her own rights, that is certainly moraly defensible. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>That's the first time that I've heard protecting an innocent unborn human being deemed " amoral ". I guess if you have no moral compass anything can be considered true north.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well, I guess you never before pondered how amoral you are in seeking to enslave the woman. I am not surprised, as the PL rarrely see the woman as anything but a walking womb. Misogyny like that is rampant in the PL community. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Your rhetoric doesn't match reality. Pregnancy doesn't equal slavery. Nice try, though. Do play again.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>But forced pregnancy cerainly does. When you deny the woman her rightful control of her own body, you are taking control, enslaving her.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>jitobear, I am deeply sorry about the experiences you have had with men. Your experience is only too, too true. Men in our culture are worshipped as being next to God in the Christian religion and are not encouraged to grow up into responsible, real human beings with respect for women. I was fortunate to grow up in a relatively non-Christian culture where more was expected from men -- and I never ran into any major problems of abuse and disrespect until I lived for a spell in very Roman Catholic Alburquerque, New Mexico.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The more that I read your posts, the more convinced that you have lived a rather sheltered life. First, there's no such thing as a monolithic Christian culture. There are shades of gray everywhere. In the North, two-income families with shared responsibilities, are the norm. I'm not seeing a lot of foot-kissing going on here. In the South, there are areas where more strict Christian beliefs are practiced, but I'd hardly say that the men aren't responsible. Quite the contrary, in many strict households, the husband is the sole breadwinner and may work multiple jobs to make ends meet. I'd hardly call that being worshipped and irresponsible. Where did you live that was relatively " non-Christian " in the US? I can't think of too many places other than nearby Dearborn, MI which has a very high Middle East population where women are certainly not treated as equals with men. Please " enlighten me " <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I quite agree, Sartre, not all Christians are alike. As a matter of fact, a number of Christian groups created an underground to ensure that women could have access to safe abortion prior to the Roe v. Wade decision. You cite a great many instances of truth. Unfortunately, if a female is considered as having morally " slipped " under these strict rules she has lowered her status to that of a prostitute and is no longer respected and protected -- in fact, her life may be subject to abuse and possible death -- something like the Middle Eastern culture you cite in your next paragraph. I grew up in the very Christian American Midwest but I lived in a tribal Scandinavian family where we had our own rules of conduct, which rules were generally morally superior to the Christian culture surrounding us.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>And I would say that they must not be very Christian to do so. Now, your credibility is really taking a hit. We don't live in the age of the Scarlet Letter. No women are ostricized or banished because they have morally slipped. Where do you get these absurd ideas? How about some examples that demonstrate the differences? I don't know anything about tribal Scandanavian rules of conduct and would like to hear about them. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Oh, that's right, the South has changed -- somewhat. Guess you can hear the N-word uttered in a number of places still -- by white folks. This refers to my own tribal family only. We just liked making our own rules and we were not hypocritical about them. In general, marriages were love matches and life-long without infidelities. Some individuals did not adhere to these rules and they were not well thought of. But we didn't go around being hypocritical about the " sanctity of the marriage, " and yammering on and on about it, we just honored the vows. We flat out speak the truth and are not liked for being so ruthlessly honest. We have little tolerance for BS meant to deceive and mislead honest folk. If we say we're going to do something, we can be expected to do it most of the time. We don't try to be liked, we try to be the sort that we in our family respect and do not feel pressured by society to conform to stupid fads and rules that don't make sense.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>What's that have to do with your statement below? Nice attempt to steer the topic away from your silly assertion. So far, it sounds like MY religion. Oh, so you're not hypocritical about the sanctity of marriage, you just think poorly about people who don't adhere to your rules, which include the sanctity of marriage? Somehow that sounds hypocritical to me. You're cracking me up with statements like the one highlighted above. It's like saying " we're honest.... well most of the time. " LOL <br><b>S1:4-  </b>OK, so you absolutely, positively, keep your word 100% of the time, no matter what the circumstances, like even if you had to chop an arm off to keep your word. I'm not claiming to be a perfect human being who is godlike and always able to keep my word. I'm afraid that I would be a liar if I made such a claim. I've never had any complaints about my conduct.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I'm sorry, I just found the statement funny. Of course, it's impossible to keep your word 100% of the time. And the fact that you acknowledged that in your statement probably reinforced your statement about your honesty.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I don't think that abortion is a moral issue. And, I shan't have the moral views of the Roman Catholic Church imposed upon me. I insist upon my right to my own moral and religious freedom, I will not be subject to a foreign entity that does not view women with respect.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Can you tell me how, in your view, the Catholic Church does not view women with respect? Is it simply its teaching on abortion? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The refusal of the church to allow women to serve in the priesthood. The denial of leadership roles within the church to women. The view of women as less than human, as merely wombs that become the property of fertilized eggs, zygotes, embryos, fetuses, etc., should a woman become pregnant.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>How does this show disrespect of women in your opinion. Perhaps we should start a new thread on this in the religion forum or go back to your old thread there that has the same theme?? THat women are less than human is not a teaching of the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church is very inclusive in its definition of who is human. It is more inclusive of larger society and the world as a whole. When the world is saying that the unborn are not human and that people who are elderly, frail, and medically compromised have no value or purpose, or that it is okay to end someone's life by withholding food and water without the presence of a living will then the Catholic Church stands up and says that all of these are humans and worthy of life, love, and protection. The Catholic Church actually teaches that we are all more than human to be exactly correct. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>In response to my statements, The refusal of the church to allow women to serve in the priesthood, and, The denial of leadership roles within the church to women, you say : Obviously, women are considered by the Roman Catholic Church to be unfit to be priests and to hold leadership roles within the church. Why else would women be so excluded from those roles?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Simone, Women are not considered to be unfit to be priests. A woman cannot be a priest just like a man cannot be a nun. It's not about being unfit. It's about trying to fulfill a role that is contrary to one's nature. As Father Fessio explained Sunday on Meet the Press, the Church is spoken of in scripture as the bride of Christ and Christ is the bridgegroom. Priests succeed Christ and a woman cannot be a bridegroom and have a nuptial arrangement with a bride. It doesn't work. And women do hold many leadership positions in the Church.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>yeah, i didn't wanna mess up what word you were using... thats all that was meant by that. As for views of women, I just want everyone to have an equal shot at life.... I don't think needless blame should be put on the baby.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>There is no baby, and you seek to " help " the fetus through subjugating the woman in the best theocratic misogynistic style. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>What is with you and the word " misogynistic " today? I believe that a human life begins at conception... I don't see what how this is lying or anything<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Perhaps from being tired of witnessing the misogyny? Prolifers are the kind of guys that give real men a bad name. When " human life " begins has nothing to do with that the developmental stage known as " baby " doesn't begin until birth. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>But rights start when a person has life not when a person becomes a " baby ". Even the roe vs wade case admits this.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But then, it is not a person until birth. Even Roe vs Wade admits this. And no, my argument about " baby " is an argument against false terminology. To me, that discussion has absolutely nothing to do with abortion or personhood and everything to do with accurate descriptions of developmental stages. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Where does roe vs wade admit that a person is not until birth? We talked about this before... it says that no where in the constitution does it define person.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Homosexuals are attracted to adults of the same sex. Pedophiles are attracted exclusively to children. There are people, such as the case with these priests, who molest children, who are not pedophiles. Molestation, like rape, isn't about sexual attraction. It is VIOLENCE. People don't molest or rape because they are so turned on they can't help themselves, they do it to HURT somebody. Get some information before shooting off at the mouth VOR. Most of those priests were probably niether gay nor pedophiles. I HATE IT - when people spread this ****. It is FALSE information that does nothing but HARM. It puts blame on the innocent while the guilty get ignored and children get hurt. Do not use this lie to justify your bigotry - for you do so at the cost of innocent people - adults and children.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>When you have no constructive comment just attacks the messenger with your insultsand name calling..... typical............... so very sad.......... Its radicals like you that hurt the cause of gay rights......... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Nice job not addressing anything I said. I am not a radical, just informed. I used to work for a sexual violence center and counseled rape victims in college. I am also a victim. Keeping myself up to date on sex crimes is important to me, partly because I want all that can be done to prevent it done. Pointing a finger at gays like this does not do that. This pyschologist sums it up nicely : http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbo...lestation.html<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You are a legend in your own mind my friend....... As little man will tell you I rarely respond to posts that insult and call people names....... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>In the post you are responding to I did neither. I simply provided information that refutes the assertation that gays are more apt to prey on children and provided a little history on my information and level of training around sexual violence. You, on the other hand, called me radical and made claims and did not back them up. Furthermore, you are perpetually insulting others. I, as a rule, think people should speak plainly, but you aren't going to get any sympathy out of me about being insulted when you perpetually call liberals names, call Duo " little man ", and are willing to insult all homosexuals with the accusation that they are child-predators.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Boy it is amazing how you turn things around......... I said that gays are attracted to members of their own sex be it boys or adults........ The priest at my parish St Gabriels in Port Orchard Wa. ( sorry little man not Florida, wrong as usual :) ) is a lawyer and was involved in the prosecution of pedophile priests in the Diocese of Seattle............. He has said that 95 percent of the priests proscuted admiited to being gay....... Don't you find it odd that the vast majority of priests convicted were molesting little boys.......... Probably just a coincidence to you.......<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Agreed. Unfortunately, the Catholic Church is doing neither of those things. When the church does little to stop it, that is when you condemn the whole church.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Thanks Maximus ;) Little? Little? Are you kidding me? The Catholic Church has done MORE than enough to stop these actions. The Church has given literally HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of dollars to the families of abused victims. You're also ignorant in thinking this is something easy to control -- it's not. We may always have pedophile priests, and we'll never know who they are. The best thing we can do now is prevent children from being hurt from such priests. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No. Settlement money is not    trying to stop these actions   . That is covering it up. It is keeping it quiet. Punishing those who do these things would help prevent these actions. In many cases, I    ve read, they simply transfer the offender to a different area where he is not known. This is partly why I condemn the church. I never suggested it is easy to control. In fact, I believe it is something intrinsic in the church that causes it to happen, so no I do not believe this will be expunged easily. This means nothing, I still condemn the church for doing little to stop it. Given how little the church does to identify and remove them, I think a good tactic is to avoid the church altogether.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Settlement money is far from quiet, in fact it is well known. What a foolish thing to imply the church is trying to hush victims. That's just completely ridiculous. You have absolutely no evidence to support such a claim. Moving priests around parish to parish for pedophilia was NOT common among most dioceses, only with the Boston dioecese. All priests are moved from parish to parish regardless of whether or not they're pedophiles ( actually, part of the reason they do this is so that such events DON'T occur, as once priests are settled in a parish they often commit acts contrary to the church, such as adultery, homosexuality, and of course, pedophilia. The church has met dozens of times concerning this issue, and is now more strict than ever with priest ordinations. How would you solve the problem in the church, may I ask? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Simply settling is almost always preferable to a drawn out trial if you want to avoid focus on it. Which is part of why I think sexual problems are inherent in the church. And yet, just recently a gay bishop was ordained? However often they meet, it is unforgivable that it has gone on so long and is so sytematic. Me? I would dissolve the church :) Though, I'm not a big fan so take that with a grain of salt.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>What would going to trial solve? Absolutely nothing! Please explain how it is the reason for seuxal problems in the church. That Gay Bishop wasn't a Catholic one, he was Anglican. Catholics and Anglican are very much different. Catholics are Catholics, Anglicans are protestants. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>And would generate bad press, etc. They wanted it to go away, so they settled. I'll answer with a question. Why would you think staying in one place would make a priest more likely to behave in an immoral way, sexually? Truly told, I could care less. I have little use for religion in general.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>So, you want it to generate bad press? The Catholic Church certianly isn't hiding anything ( the media has already publicized everything ), but why go to court and give the family absolutely NO benefit, and just embarass and put guilt on the Church more. What on earth is with everyone on this forum trying to answer questions with a question? On my debate team, I would be pointed off for doing such things. I refuse to answer the question until YOU answer mine. For the record, priests are moved every six to nine years, unless the priest is given permission to leave early or stay for longer, and unless the priest is retired at a parish. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Why does it matter what I want? The church would like nothing better than for no one to know their shame. They wanted to shut the families up, so they settled. I wasn't aware this was an epidemic Refuse all you want. I have no vested interest in this discussion. The reason that priests tend to behave immorally sexually after a certain amount of time is likely the same reason I believe sexual immorality is inherent, or at least inevitable, in or because of the church teachings, doctrine and dogma.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>My God, do you honestly have any other evidence for your arguments other than your fantasy about the church having an evil anti-family conspiracy? What such teachings / dogma ( Doctrine is dogma ) are these? The reason why pedophilia is occuring in the church is because of homosexual catholics who join the priesthood to avoid sin. However, instead of avoiding sin, they walk right into it. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I don't think it has an anti-family bent, in this at least. I think that it, like any business, didn't want bad press so did what they could to limit it. Also, like an individual, they wanted their shame to be quietly put to rest. I do think you are in denial. Not everything the church does is good and pure ;) They didn't want the accusations to come out, and they didn't want the accusations be be drug out. So they settled. Celibacy and sexual repression, in a nutshell. Would take too much time and research to give a more complete answer. I truly think that is denial of the problem. It is ignoring the problem to simply dismiss them as homosexuals ( whom you condemn anyway ) instead of thinking perhaps the Catholic view of sex might be a factor.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Some folks will go to any length to keep from discussing the real topic. Who gets to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy - the nanny state or the woman herself? Chuz, you are quite verbose on other topics. Why do you not hazard an answer to a rather simple question?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>When you agrre and accept the fact that a human individual's life biologicaklly begins at and by their conception, Chester? Then I will move on to some of the other aspects of the debate. It makes no logical sense to debate the " what if's " and the " what whens " if we can't agree on the " what is. " <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Why not just shuffle off to Buffalo? Face facts. You don't want to deal with the question, because you haven't thought through the ramifications of your absurd POV.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You are so confident in your views, Chester... Why don't you challenge me to a moderated one on one debate?? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Why don't you put your views out here for all to see? Mine are clear. No one, NO ONE - not you, not I, not the government - NO ONE but the pregnant woman has the right to an opinion on the question of whether or not she chooses to carry her pregnancy to term. She and she alone has the right to make the choice. Can that be any clearer? Now what is YOUR POV.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>My point of view is quite simple ; " I believe a person's rights begin when their life does and not just when society can't justify their denial any longer. " " My point of view is that all else ( where abortion is concerned ) is secondary to that fact. " Now, Chester,... so far no-one wants to be honest and admit that all your side has is " denial " going for them. So here I will remain fixated until we can all agree that ( at least ) biologically a human individual's life begins at and by their conception. And so far, it has been working out great for me by the way. I'm discovering all sorts of new links and references and ways of supporting my views while being here. And all that will be reflected in my website some day ( soon I hope. ) So, ( so far as I am concerned ) the sooner you and some others want to acknowledge that a human being's life biologically begins at conception, the sooner we can move on to other aspects of the issue. You can start whatever threads you want to without me. But I won't be there until this one is resolved, here. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>See, I don't have to prove a single thing. Your handle here says it all when you entitle yourself what you do. That's a ringing endorsement of the pro-choice position. If a pregnant woman chooses to carry her pregnancy to term, your handle supports that ; if she makes a different choice, your handle supports that as well. That's the essence of our POV. I would say, " Welcome to the pro-choice side of the issue. ", but I don't need to. Your handle here indicates that you are already among us.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I have always been " pro-choice, " Chester. ( You never bothered to ask the questions that would have revealed that ) I'm " pro-choice " for all people... Even criminals! We all make " choices " in life and I wouldn't want anyone messing with my right to choose anything. Nor do I seek to control anyone elses right to " choose. " Choice is an inherent part of our human nature. However, ( unlike you, where elective abortion is concerned )... I believe that there are justifications for having consequences for some of the " choices " people make. Your right to swing your fists ( for example ) ends at the tip of someone else's nose. You may have the " right to choose " to rape or molest someone,... But you don't have the right to violate another's rights without fear of consequences. ( or without the expectation that there could be consequences, either. ) Your rights end where another's rights begin. ( keyword : begin ) You say that you believe a person's right to their life should begin when their life does,... yet you run from the debate of when that moment occurs. It's very telling. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Sorry to disappoint you, but I have been consistent throughout the time that I have been posting here. A person's life begins with their first breath, not before. Now, who do you think is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy - the nanny state or the woman herself? :)<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Jito, of course all of the reasons you mention are the staple excuses that are normally given. But since when are they the real reason that motivates the woman. Last night I got a call from a Political Surveyor who asked me multiple questions regarding this election cycle. One set of questions were about what issues were most important to me regarding the Presidential election. I said that all of them were valid and important issues that I cared about, about 8 in total. She responded that I was allowed to pick as many as 3 issues that I cared about but the program didn't allow for me to pick all of them. So it is with the questionnaires every woman who gets an abortion must fill out. They have questions about why they are seeking it but not one option is to prevent wide hips, sagging boobs, a ponch stomach or not ready to stop partying, drinking or drugging. Those options aren't even made available to choose as the real reasons why women abort their babies so in your World, they don't even exist. Talk about being told what you must think and buying it hook line and sinker. Get out of that box jito, it has to be awfully tight in there.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What evidence do you have that they aren't? The most thorough stats I provided were from a PRO-LIFE website. I have provided stats and evidence - you have provided NOTHING. You have zero credibility here. None. Nada. Zip. I doubt highly that they have to fill it out at all. You are either a complete misogynist or not man enough to manage relationships with real women and thereofore the ones you people your life with are useless twits. Just promise me you will never have a daughter. You frankly don't deserve to be within ten feet of any woman. There is an " other " option. No - how about we talk about how I am a woman and a mother and how you don't know $ hit. Like so many Christians I encounter - the main motivator of your faith is complete self-indulgence. You just loooove believing you are morally superior. You don't give a damn about pregnant women and their babies. You just write them off as vain party animals rather than address the real issues or take on trying to actually doing anything to help - but then why would you? Helping them would do nothing to feed your supposed morally superior ego. Pathetic. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I assure you jito my wife is a real woman. And my 2 daughters are fine independent women who love me very much. They have good healthy self images with good healthy relationships with me so they never had to go out and prove they can be loved by having physical relationships with men and having random sex in order to feel like complete women who can be loved by a man. If you had an ounce of understanding why so many American women are promiscuous, with no self respect at all, you wouldn't be defending and justifying abortion, but would be talking about how to rebuild within women a morality based value system in order to stop the all out human carnage taking place in our abortion clinics due to the out of control and irresponsible sex that is taking place in this Country, and around the World. Just because I'm only speaking about the USA, it doesn't mean Europe and Asia is innocent in any way.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Frankly, based on this thread, I pity the women in your life. Now, enough detraction. You claimed that woman have abortions out of vanity and a need to party. THAT is what I am arguing here - nothing else. Back it up or concede. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>As I pity any man dumb enough to attempt to bond with you. Now, as to my beliefs. I have every right to them and to voice them here without proving that anyone else agrees with me at all in order to voice them. So there is nothing to concede as my beliefs are self evident. It would be nice though if you could prove that the results of surveys the abortion industry does to support their own predetermined outcomes weren't fixed and loaded to confirm precisely the results they want to come up with. Of course you will ignore that aspect of this as ignorance is bliss to your side of the issue.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Any man who believes that the most worrisome thing on a woman's mind when facing pregnancy is her breasts is not a man with whom I would wish to bond. The men I associate with regard women far higher. Yes - your beliefs are self-evident. You believe abortion is wrong and you believe women are empty-headed twits who spend their time worrying about their rack ( who knows - maybe that is true for the women in your life. ) But I am not talking about beliefs. I are talking about why women choose abortion. You made an accusation you have yet to back up with anything at all. One that I have completely discredited. It is that particular argument that you need to concede since you have proven NOTHING. And I would like to point out to you AGAIN - that they most thorough stats I provided came from a PRO-LIFE website. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I am saying, and very clearly that for a large percentage of women who have no health issues with abortion, their primary reason for killing their own offspring is because their life priorities are so warped they are more concerned about their physical self image and their lifestyle than the welfare of their own child. Talk about the epitome of selfishness. Not all women, only those women who will kill their own offspring so as not to inconvenience themselves after it is they who acted irresponsibly, not the babies they so easily murder in the name of controlling their own bodies. I have common sense and I supported it with real examples of how surveys and questionnaires are distorted and manipulated in order to get the intended results. Yes jito, but you failed to acknowledge that the pro-life / anti-abortion website that put those stats together got the info from abortion clinics within the Industry which only ask certain questions and are sure not to ask the questions I am asking.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>And it's interesting to me that your movement isn't nearly as passionate about making sure mothers know therisks about abortion as they are empowering them to do it.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Just out of curiosity, what risks do you believe the " pro-choice " movement is keeping women in the dark about, besides the emotional issues afterward ( which vary from woman to woman )? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>See the following.... http://www.afterabortion.org/physica.html And before you automatically assume these are pro-life rantings, note that everything in this list is cited from well-known journals.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>omg... that site is so rediculous! Let me read it all before I respond, but I have to say that it is inaccurate to the point of absurdity! If you want to be taken seriously, actually go to studies and see what they say instead of summaries on a pro-life site. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Then you are saying a lot of major health journals are ridiculous, because the points are cited.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No, I'm saying that their interpretations were taken out of context, slighted and exaggerated to the point of absurdity. They do their own interpretations.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Are you serious that you wanted to pitch me that softball? Abortion is the ultimate in selfish because the " mother " decides to kill a fetus instead of letting it live. The desire of the fetus to live is disregarded by the " mother ". Now, if you killed your pet dog because you didn't want to take care of it, you'd consider that a selfish act, wouldn't you?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The fetus is non-sentient, so it has no " desire ". The fetus is totally dependent on a woman's body, and has no existence without the woman's body. This is not the case with a dog. This is not the case with the woman. She is a sentient person, and not a container. She undergoes physical changes and physical risks by being pregnant. She risks, and she sacrifices, using her own body. It is selfish of a man to think he can control her body and her life. It will never have the same kind of impact on his health and on his life, that it will have on hers. Not even close. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>My dog isn't a sentient being so it has no desire and the second part of your argument has nothing to do with the first. Are you arguing that it's OK to kill a non-sentient being or any dependent being regardless of whether or not it's sentient? For instance, an invalid can also be totally dependent on someone else for their existence. Should we " ice " all invalids, too? So let me get your position straight. A woman should have the right to kill her fetus because in rare instances, it can threaten her health? That's a pretty weak argument. Would you like some stats on the number of births VS death of the mother? I'm guessing that death by car accidents are of a far greater concern to the average pregnant woman and there aren't many arguing that the highest risk pregnancies shouldn't have the option of aborting the fetus.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It has more sentience than the fetus in the early stages of pregnancy. No one can force you to use your body for anything against your will. For example, one cannot be forced to give up a kidney. I meant it has an effect on her health. Morning sickness and other problems, the load on her heart increases by 40%, etc. Yes, it could negatively affect her health in more serious ways. It is not a weak argument at all to suggest that those who will have to go through this, should make the choice. I don't understand what you mean here. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>There's no such thing as a little sentience, just like there's no such thing as being a little pregnant. You either are or you aren't. You can be forced to sit in an electric chair and fry under 20 K Volts, can't you? So the sex that created the fetus in the first place probably taxed her heart more than 40%. Maybe if she was so concerned about taxing herself, she would have abstained. It's still a lame argument. The chances of dire consequences from pregnancy are rare, usually predictable and treatable. What I meant was that a pregnant woman has more risk driving in a car than from being pregnant and that I don't know many people who would deny an abortion to a woman who has a significant probability of dying as a result of pregnancy.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I already mentioned I was wrong to put it like that. In certain jurisdictions, if you are a criminal, and it's the punishment directly related to your crime. There are things they can and can't do to the criminal. I am talking about a woman who has comitted no crime, who should have the full and equal rights of every other citizen. Not for very long, and that was her choice, other than in the case of rape. Not lame at all. It directly affects her physically. There is a reason she is continuously monitored during pregnancy. The fetus is totally dependent on her physically.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I wish it were that simply. Killing's fine under the right circumstances most of us would agree I think. Killing isn't the question but " killing what? ' " and " killing when? " I will never accept that a week after conception or 8 or 10 for that matter, we are talking about a person yet. I'm a " conditional " pro-choicer.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Actually, I agree with you somewhat. I would not be nearly as worried about very early abortion as I would mid to late term. And I can accept abortion if the life of the mother is at definite risk. I guess that makes me a " conditional " pro-lifer. I think most likely many, many people on both sides take their stance to varying degrees. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Would that not mean then that to have an abortion or not, regardless of motivation, is an issue best left between a woman and her doctor? Most doctors are not prepared to do late term abortions for the woman's convenience. Most doctors have morality. Most doctors are religious to some degree. Most doctors try to adhere to their oath to do no harm. Most doctors have children.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It's not that simple. Abortion is a pretty complicated issue and to assume the mother and doctor should be able to kill an unborn child at will is is grisly prospect. At the least there should be some control on something that powerful. The partial birth ban is a start. And who said doctors were always above reproach anyway? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Why trivialize the decision of the woman and the doctor by terming it as " at will ". Can you not grant that the reasons could be sound even if they are no business of yours? I see no reason to assume a doctor's morality is more suspect than anyone else. Indeed no one is above reproach. Not even evangelicals. Would you agree that the term " unborn child " is an exaggeration prior to some point in a pregnancy?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I have already said that I can accept abortion if the life of the mother is in danger. That should answer your question. No more than saying it is an exagerration when an expecting mother herself calls what she has inside of her " my baby. " I don't have any problem with that at all, but it seems that you would if you are determined to exclude any terms for it other than " fetus. " <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I am not determined to do anything, least of all what you suggest. Is it not possible that an expectant mother might " exaggerate " a bit in anticipation of what is coming. How many cells equal a " baby ", 2, 4, 8, 16, 32? Is that the whole strategy? Harder to kill a " baby " than a " fetus "? Rather simplistic don't you think?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Since Roe vs. Wade in 1973, and for the last four decades, the lives of some 50 million unborn American citizens, teachers, scientists, health care professionals, and taxpayers    enough souls to actually fund, in full, the Pelosi, Reid, and Obama Health Care bill, have been snuffed out on the altar of personal convenience and political correctness. And while many Republicans and Independents have likewise abrogated their moral responsibilities to the unborn, their moral turpitude pales in comparison to the dedicated left wing pro-infanticide crowd, and Barack Obama in particular. Those were future prophets to the nations and the Savior of mankind in the womb. But the pro-abortion crowd wants to pretend that instead of babies with divine plans, they were nothing more than unviable tissue masses. Well, God is not fooled, and neither are those who read and respect God    s word. (righterreport.com )<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Evidence suggests that a lot of those who got aborted would have been degenerate criminals. And if lot's of " Lord's prophets " got aborted, all the better. Come to think of it, that's some pretty pathetic god you have got, if he couldn't even protect his own prophets or those he'd invested his " divine plans " in. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Tsk tsk.... You err because you have little logic and no spiritual insight. Tell me how God creates mankind with free will but at the same time doesn't allow man to sin? You're on.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Yo err because you have abandoned logic and embraced irrationality, Your argument lies on the faulty premise of existence of specifically your god and truth of bible. However, a discussion on that would change the subject of the thread. BUT, even if your god did exist, it would be a pretty impotent entity its plans for mankind got derailed as a result of Roe vs. Wade. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You didn't mind commenting about God ( ' the Lord's prophets ' ) just before I wrote my question above to you, so why are you running scared or bugging out now? Looks to me like you couldn't answer the question. So where's the beef? Answer the question? Tell me how God creates mankind with free will but at the same time doesn't allow man to sin?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You know my answer : There is no god and no one " created " mankind. But the discussion over the existence of god belongs rightly under " Religious " or " Philosophy " section, not abortion. Is this one of the tactics you fundies frequently practice? Change the subject when you are about to lose?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No sentience, no person.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>She has the right to decide what to do with herself, no right to decide to kill her baby. If it weren't for adoption you would also have a moral obligation to raise your children no matter how bad you would want otherwise. A rapist destroys his / her rights by their act, no one else's. If someone cuts off your arm, and you can undo the damage by grafting a third parties arm on to yourself ; that doesn't give you the right to do it without their permission just because you were wronged. Raping her is cruel, keeping her from killing someone is not. What she would rather do is irrelevant. And the rapist had a choice to rape or not rape, but at least he had the choice. That's a red herring. What does feeling matter? Everything feels. She shouldn't have to go through birth if she didn't want to? Why must she go through parenthood if she didn't want to? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Sentience as in the faculty by which we experience the external world. Before the fetus has developed sufficiently for consciousness to exist, calling it a person and giving it the same rights is as a born person is logically insupportable IMO.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Is a sleeping person sentient? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Can external stimuli disturb the sleeper? There's your answer.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>That is an automatic involuntary biological response. Updating the question, is someone under industrial sedatives sentient? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>One's capacity for consciousness is not altered by a temporary suspension of that consciousness. There are no non-sentient " beings ". Only " brain death " would qualify as a loss of sentience. In which case your next of kin can to decide to unplug you and it is not homicide. You've lost your right to self-determination and your right to life with which we as a society affirm all " people " are born. You are a human being no longer just as an early term fetus is not a human being yet. YMMV.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>During that suspension there is no capacity, why would we treat this hulk of flesh like a person when it feels nothing of the external world?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>If a fetus is taken out of the womb and manages to live for an hour before dying. What is the definition of the creature from the time it leaves the womb until it finally expires, fetus or infant?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What is YOUR definition? What do you mean by " taken out "? Please clarify. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>To be honest I would prefer an answer from someone who doesnt answer a simple question by asking two stupid ones.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>To be honest, I would prefer that one who asks a question be clewar about what is being asked. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Then dont respond. I never asked you the question.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Since the question as not directed at anyone in particular, all are free to either answer it or ask for clarification. Are you referring, for example, to a very premature C-section birth or something else? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Not anyone in particular but not to imbeciles who answer a simple question with two stupid ones. Sorry I didnt make that clear.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Is it really necessary to resort to ad hominem comments? After all, they reflect more on the writer than the intended target. Now, do you care to answer the question or not? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>You obviously do not know the difference between ad hominem and insults. No I do not care to answer the question for reasons that I have explained in a previous Calling an imbecile an imbecile is a description not an insult.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Pappalion, your post is mostly second rate jokes and missing the point ( I have to assumed intentionally ). I believe the following statements of yours continue the core threads though : Define functional. Ah, so you're deciding when it's appropriate to kill? The person who is right. Their position is moral but not correct so I would not accept it. All that is required for a position to be moral is non-immorality. If they satisfy the conditions of morality they have moral beliefs. This is analogous to saying someone is ' X ' when they say ' adding ' two numbers always results in 2 when the criteria for ' X ' is arriving at 2. Now they can say god handed them down two, or anything else but 1 + 1 and they will still be ' X '. Doesn't mean their logic is sound, or any other conclusions are correct though.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Your kidding. Same way one would normally define it in this context and the same way I defined it last time we did this circle. No, but I am also not the one who is justified in telling someone else if they can have an abortion And that would be which one? Morally right is wrong? Yes being moral and immoral at the same time is impossible Are they a moral person who has a moral belief but acts immorally? If they believe it is immoral to kill but do so are they a moral person, not their acts, but the person? No Speaking of unsound logic..... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Then copy paste the normal answer from the last time. ( with post number please ) Then how can you say that killing jews is wrong? The one with a sound argument. ( or a more cogent argument ) Lol, you seriously think I am going to fall for this sad pathetic attempt at equivocation? An incorrect derivation does not necessitate an incorrect answer, one incorrect answer does not invalidate all answers from the same source. People aren't truly moral or immoral, only actions. When we say someone is moral we mean they behave morally for the most part ( or perhaps perfectly ), when we say an idea is moral we mean it pertains to moral / immoral actions ; but the derivation applies only to actions and not even really to beliefs at all.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>We both speak english it isn't difficult. They have rights Which is which one? No mind trick or slight of hand. There is no need for you to fall for anything just provide an answer. It is real simple. It is either right or wrong it isn't right but not wrong or wrong but not right. Wonderful, what idealogical position is not based on a belief? When you say pertains to moral / immoral action it is the belief that the action is one or the other. An action is neither until someone comes along and says this is that and you should or shuld not do it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Then you must be very busy. So you're deciding who has rights? Soundness - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Fine then no. This is the fallacy of equivocation look it up. All positions are beliefs.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>We all must be something OK. No one has rights, making your argument meaningless. The question is not does a person have rights, but at what point do they have them. Yes, philosophy of logic. I remember wondering why the study of logic could not agree on what symbols would be used to express statements using a keyboard. And if niether side is able to provide a sound argument or maybe both can You mean by equating abortion with murder? Because trying to apply it your position of some killing is aceptable and some is not with no objective standard by which to decide except an emotional response you try and pass off as logical. Even the objective ones? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I couldn't claim killing babies was immoral but you couldn't claim shooting abortion doctors was either :p When they exist. Suppose jews never got their rights, who's to say... If two positions are truly contradictory it is not possible for both sides to provide a sound argument. That's why you needed to look it up. It's using the same word in two senses in the same logical stream. Margarine is better than nothing. Nothing is better than butter. Therefore, margarine is better than butter. In this case using right to both mean derived correctly and moral. You ignored the objective standard and presumed emotional authority. Yes, and I've had this particular skirmish before ; I must be living with a different English than posters on this forum because I've never used belief to imply any kind of epistemological origin at all nor has anyone I know. If you've got a less controversial word to mean : : a degree of conviction of the truth of something esp. based on a consideration or examination of the evidence please bring it to me.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Your attempts to baffle the readers with Bull excrement asside,... the answer to the question " is a human fetus a part of his / her mother's body? " is a resounding NO! Next!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Your website ( which, incidentally, was created by a pro-life freshman ) is based entirely on the fact that the mother's immune system can treat the ZEF as an invader - the quoted references simply state this fact, it is the website which makes further implications. This immune response is identical to how the immune system sometimes reacts to an organ transplant when rejection occurs - following your logic ( as before ), a transplanted organ is not part of the recipient's body. Clearly this isn't the case. romebigred : I agree with much of what you are saying. I'll save a response until you complete your reply, though. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The fact is,.. a transplanted organ is NOT " part of " a recepient's body. At least it is not a " part of... " in the sense that you are suggesting it is. Can you provide any scientific references that claim that it is? I'll be waiting. It's not in this one<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Borderline. Ultimately, though, I would probably not, for a couple of reasons. Firstly, there is no real attachment between host and tapeworm - it's simply that the tapeworm has got it's teeth into the wall and isn't letting go. Secondly, the tapeworm is an organism in it's own right. Yes, I know you think a foetus is also - you have yet to show, however, that such a scientific consensus exists. As a matter of fact... Merriam-Webbster defines the placenta as the " organ in mammals except monotremes and marsupials that unites the fetus to the maternal uterus " ( bold mine ). Just in case you were wondering about that bolded word - the first definitions for unite are " 1 a : to put together to form a single unit " or " 1 a : to become one or as if one ", depending on context. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Short on time ; Can you tell me ( in mammals ) which organism creates and developes the placenta?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Wikipedia tells all - " The placenta develops from the same sperm and egg cells that form the fetus, and functions as a fetomaternal organ " In short - it originates from the zygote, but is considered part of both foetus and mother - hence the ' unite ' in Merriam-Webster, I would imagine. However, asking ' what organism does the placenta come from ' is a loaded and misleading question, as the zygote is not an organism. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>No, Ian... check the DNA. The placenta ( as you have already posted ) is an " organ " it's 100% created by the new " organism " which was created by the union of the sperm and egg. Maybe this will help ; " placenta - The organ formed on the wall of the uterus by the developing embryo that provides oxygen and other nourishment from the woman to her fetus and through which waste products are eliminated from the fetus. " - Planned Parenthood Your willfull ( deliberate ) ignorance on these details is the very reason I view further debate with you to be a waste of time that can be better spent elsewhere.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>There are no ways of leaving the womb alive other than birth ( unless you know of a secret passage )<br><b> S2:1-  </b>C-section, but I believe he is talking about the intentions of those overseeing the procedure. Such isn't a new moral situation, you have the exact same thing with organ transplants, it's a bit of a red herring though because just because you need to remove the fetus from the mother to save her does not mean you need to kill the fetus ; you can provide the fetus / infant with medical support after it has been removed. If the fetus / infant is at a stage where you can't keep it alive outside of the womb, that's just the state of our medical abilities and it will die like millions of people do because there's no cure. That puts us on the hook if and when we do develop artificial wombs though. It has been noted that not many abortions are late term, well not many are to save the mothers life either. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I would call a child being delivered by c section as being born albeit not a vaginal birth. To be honest I thought it so obvious as not to mention it ( birth being defined as leaving the womb alive ) The secret passage remark was a poor attempt at sarcasm I think number 3 covered the rest of your post<br><b> S2:2-  </b>About #3, would you consider it an abortion if there was never any intention of killing the fetus / infant? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If you are asking whether I think that a delivery that resulted in the death of the infant should be considered a abortion... no. I cant see how it could be. If you are asking about a situation where an invasive procedure such as an amniocentesis test resulted in the fetus being miscarried.. no again. On the other hand I suppose a miscarriage is an abortion of sorts... What did you have in mind Freedom?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You said : If it's not ' viable ' than it will die regardless of the efforts of anyone to save it ; obviously a doctor can't violate an infants rights by trying to save it and failing. The health of the mother will never require the termination of the fetus, at worst it's removal. If any operation in which the intention is not to kill the fetus is not an abortion, than no operation which intends to protect the mother from medical risk is necessarily an abortion. Thus the health of the mother is ultimately irrelevant ; i.e. whether or not you kill the infant is secondary to the procedure and one does not have to make an exception for ' abortions ' which protect the mother from medical risk for as you say they do not need to be abortions proper. AKA rights do not conflict and no ' weighing ' needs to be done on that front, weighing medical risks sure, but not rights. Further I would like to know why pain or stress should be factors, they certainly aren't for other murders except to increase the punishment. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>My definition of a viable fetus in this context was explained by the words in brackets.... that is a fetus that would have a reasonable chance of survival using the technology available. If the mothers health is compromised and the live fetus is removed dead then its a termination. If its removed live its a birth.. both are removal. An abortion should be a stressless and painless procedure for the fetus.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Detected how? Why do any of these matter? Are they supposedly necessary or sufficient conditions? Why? They aren't self-aware, they aren't conscious or rational. Then please justify the idea that child abandonment is immoral. In the frame of reference of the solar system I don't believe that it tuned out to be correct. This too is not proof. It's still your house, and you can't kill the other person. And if the guy with a gun leaves a baby in your house and you escape and come back you still can't kill the baby, and if you throw it out the window you will be abandoning it to die because it cannot live independently. You can't the attempt is sufficient provocation to use lethal force in defense not to execute in cold-blood. When I think it's appropriate is in the defense of your rights or others, and there are no other justifications so yes. I believe it's wrong to murder. It begins when the subject of obligation begins..... but the fetus will of course be alive unless you take actions to kill it, as they do.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Is it still okay for the guilty unborn? ;)<br><b> S2:1-  </b>There are none. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You mean ' there IS none '.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The " guilty unborn " is a category and is referred to in the plural regardless of the actual number of entities it contains. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You may be correct, but... NONE is a contraction of the words NOT ONE You would say ' there is one ' ( not ' there are one ' ). You would say ' there is not one ' ( not ' there are not one ' ). You should say ' there is none '. It's really that simple.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>None | Define None at Dictionary.com I'm a post 9th century man ( looks self-satisfied ).<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Some believe that the definition depends on the circumstances and the attitude of the mother. A fetus that is aborted but still has some life left in it is still a fetus but a premature baby that is struggling for life and being aided by technology to survive is an infant? I dont believe your assertion that the circumstances change the actual definition of the struggling fetus / infant. Is an aborted fetus that would have a chance to survive with proper after care still a fetus? Is an aborted fetus that has not yet died a fetus or an infant? If so why is a very premature born baby considered an infant? Would it not be more accurate to define it as a fetus? I know that it is very rare for a fetus to be aborted at a late stage in the pregnancy but that does not detract from the need determine where the definition of a fetus ends and an infant starts. I do not believe that it depends on the attitude of the mother or the circumstances of its extraction from the womb. That is so subjective a definition that it is worthless.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Who believes that, exactly? " Fetus " and " infant " are terms that have meanings. We can use them however we want, but that doesn't mean that we're using them correctly. Believe what you will. If birth happened, it's an infant. If not, it's a fetus. No, because birth happened, albeit prematurely. That said, a prematurely born infant is still going through stages of what is ordinarily fetal development. Birth. It's pretty straightforward. To repeat, believe what you will. " Fetus " and " infant " will mean what they mean, regardless of what you believe or don't. What's subjective about it? Birth is an observable process, and marks the divide between normal prenatal and normal postnatal development. If birth happens too early, then what is normally part of the prenatal stage will have to be developed postnatally. Where is there anything subjective about this? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>First you state that ' fetus ' and ' infant ' have no definite meanings then you dispute that their meanings are subjective. You contadict yourself in the same post. The terms fetus and infant seem to be interchangable. An aborted 27 week fetus remains a fetus and a 27 week premature born fetus is elevated to the status of infant<br><b> S2:2-  </b>How is pointing out that terms can be misapplied an indication of contradiction?!? We are always free to disregard the standard of application for a term. That doesn't mean that such usage is correct. And in fact, the idea of a correct usage presupposes that the standard is something non-subjective. Perhaps of the two of us, I'm not the one who misunderstood what I wrote? And yet, they're not. Infants have been born ; fetuses have not. BECAUSE BIRTH IS THE DIVIDING LINE. HOW OFTEN DOES IT NEED TO BE SAID? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>IF BIRTH IS THE DIVIDING LINE THEN AN INDUCED ( induced labour ) ABORTION MAKES THE FETUS AN INFANT THEN DOESNT IT. Arent capital letters fun? Perhaps of the two us you are the one who misunderstood what you wrote?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes, it does. Why do you think I would disagree with this? If you look at my immediately preceding post, you'll note that I agree, this is partly true. Any method of abortion that causes birth would make the fetus no longer a fetus. I agree with that assessment. Nothing I said earlier would give any indication otherwise, except that you evidently felt like jumping to conclusions about my position and adding things to it that weren't there. However, as I also said in my now immediately preceding post, you'll note that it is false that abortion always results in birth. Late term abortions and early term abortions are quite different. Yup. Logic is fun, too. Try it. Nope. Perhaps -- no strike that : without any doubt -- as noted above, you added in a bunch of stuff to my position that I didn't say, and then proceeded to criticize me for the stuff you added than for the stuff that I actually said. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>IF BIRTH IS THE DIVIDING LINE THEN AN INDUCED ( induced labour ) ABORTION MAKES THE FETUS AN INFANT THEN DOESNT IT. I have been asserting the above for several posts. I have expressed time and time again that if the fetus was not defined as a infant after birth then the definition would be subjective. You seemed to be more intent to copy and paste what was irrelevant than actually read my posts. I try to keep it simple. EDIT.. actually I never actually asserted that the above was correct but after questioning the validity of the opposing view ad nauseum I suppose I expected another poster to assume I believed the opposite of what I opposed<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I was responding to your point, not attempting to drive a new one. I think abortion should be illegal, not because any arbitrary majority says so but because it is immoral.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I dont. I dont see anything immoral about most abortions. In fact, I think that there are times where NOT having an abortion is the immoral choice. So, now that we are operating in the real world where there is no such thing as a moral absolute, which part of the constitution do you see as giving the federal government the power to regulate abortion?? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>In the real world it is morality that is absolute and arbitrary authorities like the constitution that are fluid.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Wrong answer, sport. If that was the case, you and I would not have different moral stances on abortion.... or anything else. Morals are not absolute. They never have been. The very idea lies somewhere between ridiculous and moronic. As has been amply demonstrated here for you before, morals have been fluid throughout history. So, now that we have put that silliness behind us, please answer the question. Where in the constitution do you see power for the federal government to regulate abortion? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Why? How do you know? Ad hominem I never said I did. If I was to make the case though it would come from wherever they have the power to regulate murder.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Because you would be able to logically illustrate the superior value of a particular moral stance. Because we can look at historical moral paradigms and recognize that they have shifted over time. No, its not. And where is that? I have read the constitution a few times and have never seen anything that would tend to suggest that the federal government has the power to regulate murder. That would fall under the individual states police power. There is a federal law against murder, but it only applies under a few specific circumstances such as murders that occur on federal property, or if the murdered individual is a federal agent, occurs in an area under federal jurisdiction but not inside a state ( such as DC ), etc... So, unless you bang a federal agent and then have the baby aborted on a military base somewhere, the federal government should have nothing to say about it. I am OK with that. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>And? Really, how do you record the change in a moral truth? Yes it was......<br><b>S1:1-  </b>... here's the legacy of your father Satan ( John 8:44 ), operating through your liberal, left-wing infanticide centers : 2 workers plead guilty to murder in abortion case Baby butchers. You radicals ought to be real proud of that. Avoid personal responsibility ( the hallmark trait of liberalism ) and kill the innocent babies.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Insofar as I believe that infanticide is morally wrong and rightly illegal, I find the crime ghastly and the murder charges quite justified. I continue to believe, however, that there is a major difference between abortion and infanticide -- and this is especially so for the 80 + % of abortions that are performed during the first trimester. Meanwhile, here's the legacy of your side : Scott Roeder gets Hard 50 in murder of abortion provider George Tiller | Wichita Eagle Your pride and joy, no doubt! > flush! < <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Nice try, preppie. The difference is that the right-to-life movement doesn't have extermination centers for the innocent unborn.

Theocrats. > flush! < <br><b>S1:3-  </b>< Flush > Media covers up gay on gay murder Media ' covering up sordid, gay-on-gay murder ' Besides the innocent unborn, you people even kill yourselves, and get the media to cover up for you.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>" We people? " Give me a break. Perhaps you have me confused with the poster whose moniker is " Matthew S. " I realize its confusing, what with there being a whole letter to pay attention to. But do try to keep up. But I will say that while I'm not gay myself, I'm definitely on Matthew S's side on this issue, because I support gay rights entirely. I realize that the very idea of defending the liberties of people who don't live as you do is completely alien to your theocratic freedom-hatred. But unlike you, I actually care about religious freedom. Meanwhile, Christian-on-Christian violence happens all the time, so I don't see what your non-objective news source's story proves at all, even if despite its flagrant bias, the story is true. Indeed, the American religious liberties that you so loathe, stem largely from a desire not to repeat the following : European wars of religion - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Christians killing Christians -- who'd'a thunk it?!?

I would kill anybody who got in my way, no question, no excuses, would not give a flying XXXX whether it was legal or not "? Lot's of hot air there, preppie, but no action. You're an empty suit and you know it. It's people LIKE YOU who vote for the Obamas and all the other left wing imbeciles who promote abortion and who are wrecking this country.

John 8:24<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Note the lack of any mention of what he has actually done. Lots of blather, another mention of the current US president ( thought you were supposed to support the president, whoever it happened to be - that was the rhetoric when the last president was in power ), lots of insults of ' people like you ' and another pointless reference to the bible.

But just out of interest, what have you actually done to prevent abortion? We're all still dying to know. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Submit it to prayer, preppie. Maybe God will help educate you on that.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Wow, still no answer. Ever thought of becoming a politician?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I dont believe that taking the morning after pill in so do speak an abortion, that is taking percaution after the fact and I do think a women should take those percautions befor the fact, of course rape cases are different. But I also see those who are out thier having unprotected sex, and everyone knows what happens. These women need to either protect themselves from preagnancy or dont have sex and for the love of god do not use abortion as a birthcontrol. I only became intrested in this subject because I am doing research for a class and I watched some vidioes and seen many pictures of babies from 7 weeks to 24 weeks and I am sorry but at 24 weeks it is a baby not a fetus, it is a child created in its parents image. It is sad, and I dont know how a mother can feel her child move inside her and then have an abortion, yes it is murder and yes she should sit in prison<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What about couples who are using contraception responsibly but end up pregnant due to whatever fluke happened to have occurred? If the woman gets an abortion, does she also deserve to be imprisoned as a felon? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Well I believe that every thing happens for a reason, for whatever reason she became preagnant it is a gift, at the time it may not seem like a gift. This is such a touchy subject I think that women who are useing abortion as a birth control are in the wrong, I would not want to have a child out of a rape situation, but I do believe in God and as I said befor it happend for a reason.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Ah, then our development of safe and reliable abortion procedures must have happened for a reason. Just because you think that any pregnancy is a gift doesn't mean that it is. Either way, though, you didn't answer the question. I specifically asked you if a woman who is using contraception responsibly but happens to become pregnant through no fault of her own should be convicted of murder for having an abortion. What is your answer? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yes, it is still inhuman<br><b> S2:3-  </b>And you still haven't answered my question. Why not? And here's another : If everything happens for a reason, then don't abortions happen for a reason? And if you saw one at 24 weeks, then you still have no idea how a typical abortion is done. Either you have been duped into believing that those abortions are representative of the whole, or you know that they aren't but pretend that they are. Either way, you have some work to do. And not all mothers ask to conceive. Which brings us back to the question that you won't answer. In order for this argument to work, you have to show that a fetus qualifies as " alive. " And the science says that you're wrong for the representative case.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Thanks. It goes farther than that. The plain ol ' birth control pill ( which is also part of the morning after stuff ) usually prevents pregnancy by preventing ovulation. It appears that it also work a minority of the time by preventing implantation of a conceptus. Bingo, that's abortion, too. Are any pro-lifers for banning the bcp as well?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It only works that way if you just started taking it after becoming pregnant... after conception has taken place that is. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No. That would be like the morning after pill.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>i'm not sure how that negates what I said about birth control pills. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You said it works that way only after starting the pill after becoming pregnant. This means after conception occurs. You said it ONLY works this way if you START the pill AFTER you became pregnant. That is not what I said. Occasionally, rarely actually, ovulation and then fertilization occurs while ALREADY ON THE PILL. In that case, implantation can be discouraged. Thus, rarely the BCP is an abortifacient even if you have been taking the pill all along. Good god, man.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>During the first month of taking the pill you have a chance to get pregnant and thus implantation may not happen after conception. I'm fully aware of this but I was under the impression that after the first month this does not happen. I could be wrong, It has been some time since I've read up on the birth control pill. I ask that you lose the smart tone though as I was asking the question is a true manner as I was unclear about what your post was stating.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I can't either but I believe if your going to error then do it on the side of life.....<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Hmm, thats strange you say that, because you are so quick to be for the death penalty. I dont beleive the death penalty is on " the side of life ". <br><b>S1:2-  </b>WF, that is a cop out and you know it........ The innocent, defenseless baby in the womb did not murder or rape anyone.. He / she committed no crime against another human being.........<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The innocent man on death row didnt do anything either. I thought you said to " err on the side of life ". btw - VOR, I responded to you Iraq troops / mission debate in the current threads a little bit ago. Im not sure if you skipped over it or not because a lot of post were going at the time. Just to give you a heads up if you didnt already know. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Did you ever hear a guy or death row say he was not innocent... All the murders and rapes are just and illusion, a mirage........... Thanks, I will check it out...........<br><b> S2:3-  </b>If the guy says he is innocnet, that doesnt make it true. Innocence is proved by " proof ". " Proof " isnt asking the the guy on death row if he is guilty or not. No need to kill an actuall " innocent " man, I just dont see how it " errrs on the side of life ". <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I think the number of people executed that are innocent is less then 1 percent regardless what the liberal media organizations with their agenda put out.......... It is sad that any innocent person is executed but to compare that with 40,000,000 innocent babies murdered in the womb since Rowe V Wade was enacted in 1972 is ridiculous...........<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I thought that you " err to the side of life though ". Who cares about those innocents on death row though. We " err on the side of life ", but are very quick to kill this guy.......... It is very sad that you refuse to accept a womens choice. You con-abortion people are all religious conservaties. Let me ask you this. Is it a " blessing from God " when the baby isnt even wanted by the mother / father? A " fetus " in my opinion isnt a baby, and therfore abortion isnt killing a " human being ". My personal beliefs.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The reduction of health concerns to " a summer without tennis " is intellectually dishonest and frankly idiotic. Pregnancy puts various amount stress on a woman's body, and that stress is dealt with in different ways. For some, that stress is easy to manage, for others it is a serious health concern. To dismiss all health concerns as you are doing physically makes me sick. A woman's health is more than " convenience " for the woman involved.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Can you cite some reasons other then the ones we mentioned why it is OK for a woman to murder her baby? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>As long as the fetus is inside of the woman and using her body and damaging her health, she should have the right to remove her body from the life-support function she is involved in.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Boy are you thick headed........ If the woman's life is endangered we all agree that an abortion is and option.......... We are talking about abortions for convenience or birth control....... Why can't you get that thru your head?????? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I didn't say her life was endangered. I said her health is damaged, and that occurs in every pregnancy. What you consider " convenience " can be a very desperate circumstance for the woman involved. Lets see if he admits that. So far anything besides rape or her dying is " convenience " for him.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Sigma what about the adverse effect that and abortion has had on millions of women including the complaintant in Rowe V Wade? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>1. What adverse effects? 2. Whatever effects abortion causes are chosen by the women involved. In forced pregnancy the adverse effects of pregnancy are not chosen. 3. It's " Roe " not " Rowe "<br><b> S2:4-  </b>They regret the decision to abort for the rest of their life....... <br><b>S1:5-  </b>The only women I have ever seen actually regret the decision felt they were coerced into it. And that is a fairly small percentage. What adverse effects?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>That is because you bury your head in the sand and refuse to see the real world when it comes to murder in the womb............ Make no mistake about it that is what it is....... Murder in the womb............ <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Oh, Voice of Reason, you're so funny. For a while there I thought you might answer my questions but then you slip back into this rhetoric. I don't suppose you have an argument as opposed to this emotional rhetoric?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Here we go again attack the messenger when you have no constructive response on the issue of the debate...........<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Bottom line is liberals can rationalize all day that its the woman's body and she has the right to termonate a pregnancy any time during the term she wants too...... If there were not a living human being growing inside her I might agree, but no one has the right to terminate that life unless the mother's life is endangered or in the case of rape and incest......... Only God should make that determination.......<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And we will have a lot of really hurting mothers and babies if you refuse to acknowledge other factors as well. Financial issues, health issues, access to medical care, having a safe living environment and a million other issues will continue to impact pregnancy and influence the decisions of women regardless of the legal standing of abortion. If you really want to reduce abortion and help babies - you have to do better than this - otherwise you will fail. That or you really don't care. Oh, and not to split hairs - but actually women at this point in time do have the right to terminate their pregnancies ( at least in the US ). <br><b>S1:2-  </b>And we have a lot of women that who have had abortions regretting it the rest of their life including the woman who wast the complaintant in Rowe V Wade....... Plus 40,000,000 babies aborted since 1972, most needlessly........ 40,000,000 think about it....... that figure is numbing..... That is more people then there are in New York and California combined..........<br><b> S2:2-  </b>One woman's regret does not give her the right the trump the next woman's decision. And thanks, by the way, for proving my point. You still insist on not acknowledging any woman's issue outside of violence done to her or impending death as anything that deserves to be recognized. You don't care about women. Really, you don't. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I love women :)............ What other reasons would there be to murder a baby in the womb?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Love like yours - who needs hate? The reasons for abortion are as numerous and varied as women are. But you don't see that. All you see is a baby making machine who has nothing to worry about in this world at all unless she is at death's door. Pregnant women need - food, shelter, safety, medical care, an income, and all the same things you do. They may also be supporting other children. Those issues impact pregnancy - but you absolutely refuse to acknowledge them. You seem to think that all pregnant women are spoiled little rich girls with endless means and you trivialize their issues down to " bad hair days " and " stretch marks ". You are blind and hateful and insulting to every woman alive - including your wife, sisters, and daughters. And who is the horse's behind who reduced helath concerns to a summer without tennis? What are you - some white bred yuppie who has never left the burbs? Lots of women are poor. Lots of women have families to support. My health concerns caused me to have to stop working half way through my pregnancy - something that was managable for me as a single woman, but would not be now - the single mother of a ten year old boy who gets ZERO child support. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>This whole post is such a crock of ****..... There are all kinds of social services and charities that will help a woman with all the things you mentioned.......... Catholic services just to mention 1........... What a frigging cop out............... You have to do better then that........ I could turn you every which way but loose... trust me....... :)<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Oh WOW - I guess Imissed the headlines that poverty has been licked. And the one that all people have medical insurance now. And nobody is homeless! I am so excited. These things all just went away in my sleep last night. woo hooo What a relief! Are you seriously this clueless? Do you really think there are respources enough. Come spend a week in my neighborhood and tell me that again - and I live in a HIGH tax state with more resources than most. God forbid I send you to New Mexico, where my sone was born, and me a social worker had to LIE to the state government to get me access to medical care. I love how your cozy male self continues to harbor the illusion that you know what it is like for these women. You get more insulting every time you post. I wouldn't let you near. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>As usual you jump all over the place............ I am talking about social services for Pregnant Women........... Any woman that can not afford to carry a baby to term can get the financial assistance they need from them...... As far as insulting goes you open mouth insert foot and i just calles em as I sees em............. I don't think I would ever want to get near a woman like you who is without compassion for the unborn...............<br><b> S2:5-  </b>You just keep proving how you don't care about women every time you post. All you care about is getting them through pregnancy. All they are to you is a pregnancy. The only thing you will address or acknowledge is that pregnancy. You completely dismiss everything else in their lives - their safety, jobs, education, and any family they may be supporting. Everything takes a back seat to that pregnancy. And you say I have a lack of compassion? You see very little. Funny thing to say to a woman who lied, worked three jobs, doubled her course load, to have her baby AND get her degree so she would be able to support it later. I love kids and would like to spoil every last one on this planet. The difference between my compassion and yours is that mine doesn't end at birth. You can't and won't help babies by continuing to trivialize serious issues and demonize desperate women. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Well thank God you did not have a bad hair day when you found out you were pregnant......<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Go to hell. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>Such language Jitobear for such a dedicated and caring person........ Save me a seat will you............ :)<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What I don't get is that the anti-abortion, particularly those who use the 40 million number is why they never talk about the consequence of feeding, clothing and educating these children, not to mention the opportunity cost of forcing women ( and their other caregivers ) to have these children. But that isn't all that suprising really as most people here don't have the simplest grasp of economics. Seems that they think that life in the womb is precious, but don't give a damn about the kid or the impact upon society once s / he is born.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Because putting a price on human life is ok!!!!....... If you say so. You do know everything, right? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Since when has human life never had a price on it? Human life has always had a price and a rather cheap one at that looking at history.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>And you think this is ok? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Does it matter? When will life itself cease to have a price? Even if I don't like it, it doesn't mean that it's going to stop. Growing up means making peace with establishment. Life has always had a price since the dawn of time and will always have a price until the universe contracts and all matter is sucked into oblivion waiting for the critical point where it all starts over again.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yeah it does matter if you put a price on a human life. I guess if you support slavery though and prefer devaluing human life... In fact you probably support devaluing women too ( which many are against on this forum ). You would be ok with girl being on the corner or maybe even having a 5 yr old in the sweat shop for 10 hrs. So YEAH IT MATTERS. So just because other people do it means it is ok? I guess Duo is in favor of pricing humans<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I have compassion for both them other and the baby........ I just think a woman needs a good reason to murder her baby unlike you.......<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Having a 13 year old go through pregnancy though is pretty tough. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Its just as tought for her to have an abortion, something she might regret the rest of her life........<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That depends, but I'd rather not force a 13 year old to have a baby. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Why would you force her to have and abortion then?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I wouldn't force that either. I'd keep it as an option. This girl is in a group home right? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Yes and the state made the decision for her...........<br><b> S2:4-  </b>As I read a previous article on this, she requested one and it was blocked sending this to the courts. Am I wrong? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>You might be right, I am not sure........... I just feel the damage caused by an abortion would be worse then the damage of giving birth....... Just my opinion........<br><b> S2:5-  </b>It hard to know what she will believe when she gets older. Having the baby then puting it up for adoption would be best, but I have no idea what a pregnancy for a 13 year old would belike, so I really can't put myself in her shoes. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I can't either but I believe if your going to error then do it on the side of life.....<br><b>S1:1-  </b>While in labor I said nothing at all.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I don't have any stats but I believe there are women out there that have had abortions because they did not want to go through labor........... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Well - JP has posted stats more than once and that was not amongst them. Labor is a scary and painful thing - especially at the beginning of a first pregnancy. However, by the end of 9 + months.... whatever it takes, just get it out!<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Nobody said it wasn't but that is no excuse for aborting the baby....... The simple answer is if you don't want to go through labor don't get pregnant..... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>There were two points to my post - neiother of which was justifying fear of labor as a reason to abort. Point One - That's not why they seek abortions and the stats I have seen and that JP has posted back that up. Point Two - Just trying to be light. Fear of labor grows dim by nine months of pregnancy.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>so are you saying that women don't get abortions for the reason of its inconvenient to have a baby? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>No - what I said is they don't get abortions due to not wanting to go through labor. Women get abortions for more reasons than we can possibly know. Pregnancy and babies are a lot more than an " inconvenience ". If that's all they are to you, why are you so hell-bent on this? I think most women have a valid reason for getting an abortion and lot more could be done to help both baby and mother if we addressed those reasons so she doesn't have to abort. But noooooo - it's all about stretch marks and labor pain to lifers. Nothing to address. Go ahead and ban abortions - then you can all get together and pat each other on the back completely blind blind to rights you have trampled and the damage you have done.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No, no, dear Cone, I am merely stating my moral position which I would never, never impose upon you by forcing you to have an abortion when you have moral objections to such a thing. I do believe in choice, you know, and if a person believes that abortion is morally wrong, that person should never have an abortion.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Suppose you have a moral objection to Frank killing you, but Frank has no such moral objection. What then? Do you believe in choice in this scenario? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Cone, I'm not following you on this. We were discussing abortion, not murder.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>We are talking about imposing a moral code on someone. You said : I am wondering if you are willing to follow this logic to its conclusion. If you do anything to force Frank not to kill you, you are imposing your own personal moral code on him. My point is that it is impossible to live by the standard " it is wrong to force one's personal moral code on another. " <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Cone, you are talking about murder and a vast majority of people find that murder is immoral. We are discussing abortion, here, not murder. Murder is immoral. It harms people. Therefore, one stops people from murdering others.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Let me try to tie this together. Your initial claim that I am challenging is this one : When speaking to the issue of abortion, you say that it is wrong to impose one's personal moral code onto someone else, i.e., it would be wrong to outlaw abortion. Then I asked : To which you responded : So in the case of murder, you say it is right to impose one's personal moral code onto someone else, i.e., it would be right to outlaw murder. Thus you have now claimed 1 ) that it is wrong to impose one's own personal moral code onto someone else and 2 ) it is right to impose one's own personal code onto someone else. 1 ) these claims are inconsistent with each other, and 2 ) the second claim directly contradicts your first claim that " it is dead wrong to force your morals upon someone else. "<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Planned Parenthood can't wait to get 13 year old girls on the table to abort their babies..........<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Ah! So wellspoken for an addle-pated twiddle poop! I congratulate you! And a total lie! Who the Hades wants 13 - year-old children to be sexually active? No responsible, thinking person could wish such a thing. You malign Planned Parenthood. You have ceased to be a credible commentator on this issue. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Let me make this perfectly clear......... Planned Parenthood is a farce, a joke, a front for abortion, and I personally know of a case where a 13 year old girl went to them for and abortion and the could not wait to get her on the butchers block.......... In your haste to murder the innocent you my friend are the one who has zero creditability.......<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Let's have the details of this case. Where did this occur? Was there any media coverage of this event? What are your real facts on this? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>1. It was a friend of mines daughter..... 2. No media coverage, planned parenthood would not allow it.. 3. See number 1<br><b> S2:3-  </b>OK, thank you for your candidness on this, but can you disclose some particulars on this situation. I presume that you do not identify your location in your profile so that no one involved will have their privacy violated. How was it that this child became pregnant? Who made the decision for her to have an abortion? I'm going to presume that probably owing to her very young age it would not have been a good thing health wise for her to continue the pregnancy. What were the circumstance of her going to Planned Parenthood? Did she do so without the knowledge and consent of her parents? Were her parents aware of all this while it occurred? Or, after the fact? Have you been privy to the child's own recollection of this experience? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>1. Her boyfriend 2. She did 3. you assume wrong.. 4. Her boyfriend told her about PP 5. yes 6. No 7. Yes<br><b> S2:4-  </b>How was it that this child became pregnant? How old was her boyfriend? Were her parents aware that she had a boyfriend? Why was it possible for this child to have sex with her boyfriend? Where were her parents? Who made the decision for her to have an abortion? Did she talk about her reasons for choosing to have an abortion? I'm going to presume that probably owing to her very young age it would not have been a good thing health wise for her to continue the pregnancy. Are you a qualified medical person who could assess the health and development of that child in order to make that judgment? What were the circumstance of her going to Planned Parenthood? How old WAS this boyfriend? Did he have a lot of experience referring his girlfriends to PP? Did she do so without the knowledge and consent of her parents? Again, where were her parents? Why weren't they keeping track of their 13 - year-old daughter? That seems a bit young to be so unsupervised. Were her parents aware of all this while it occurred? Where were they, then? Have you been privy to the child's own recollection of this experience? No comment at present. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Since I was not a member of the family, just a close friend I am not able to answer those questions....... Bottom line is a 13 year old that wants to have and abortion should have their parents consent.......... If you can't see that then I don't know what to say to you...........<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No, because unless you are absolutely sure that there is a supreme being deciding there are absolute morals - then they may not be and to all intents and purposes there isn't. For absolute morals, everyone must be able to see and understand them absolutely as they are fundamental things.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>But if you're not absolutely sure that he doesn't exist, then you have no basis to claim that he absolutely doesn't ( which is what Duo's claim does ). <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Philosophically you can't be absolutely sure of anything and everything is meaningless. However, we have to make certain assumptions to exist in the real world - some things that are infinitably improbably we can say don't exist. If not things just get silly<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Why try to establish a single absolute if this absolute has built in assumptions that are unknown, i.e. are uncertain? Duo's claim did not say " it is probable that there is only one absolute truth. " The possibility, however small, that a second aboslute could be established undermines the claim that " there is only one absolute " <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The claim that ' there is only one absolute ' is wrong. Definitions are absolute by definition, you could probably make a case for maths too. Moral absolutes and the normal kind are different, the latter has no bearing on this kind of thing as it has nothing to do with morals.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>This does not really address my claim. Is it possible that a divine being could establish a second moral absolute? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You are asking me if a being that could create a moral absolute could make a moral absolute. Yes, clearly if such a thing could do that then it could. Does such a thing exist? Who knows. Will we ever know for certain? Probably not, unless it wants to make things perfectly clear and make everyone instantly aware of this moral absolute. Until it does, it can make as many as it likes - unless it makes everyone aware of these absolutes there is no difference between moral absolutism and relativism for the ignorant mortals. Up til now it hasn't<br><b> S2:4-  </b>My point is, if we don't know whether he exists or not, we cannot reasonably make a claim that seeks to absolutely establish his non-existence. Therefore, we can't claim that there is only one absolute truth.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Duo, Please go back and read some of the posts... When you say that culture and society norms are the basis then we couldn't ever change anything. If we made our decisions about what is right and wrong on what society says we would never say slavery was wrong. We would look at our culture, see that slavery was ok, and then decide it was ok. This is obviously not true.. because somewhere along the line one person got the idea it was wrong and decided to tell others it was wrong and others believed it... Where did that guy get his idea that it was wrong from? Probably an absolute huh? A story is posted a few pages back that also answers the " culture basis " question. So what is the basis?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why do you say that? Culture and societal norms change. Your argument is based upon that Culture and societal norms don't change. They do, therefore the rest is irrevelant. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Maybe you shoulda read the rest of what I posted. They do change... but BASED ON WHAT? How can you change something if you don't know anything different? Where does the different idea come from? An idea come from some BASIS..... So what is the basis since it can't be society or culture. As no other ideas would come about if it is based on that.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You said they don't change. But then they do. You assume they don't. There are always a huge amount of ideas out there as well as new ones being formed. None of which have to do with absolutism. How about a need? Let's take a example, people needed a " thing " to sit on besides a rock. they invented a crude chair. Where did that idea come from? How so? He saw treatment that was brutal. You don't need a absolute moral view to understand sheer burtality. Cone : I adjusted my position due to the interference by a supernatural power. That changes alot of things don't you think? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I didn't say they don't change... I said they wouldn't change if you based your morals on societies morals. So now the basis is " needs "... you just said it was society. You need a basis for your beliefs. How would someone know that brutal treatment is bad if they had no basis for that.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But societal morals change. So? Society can change its morals on the basis of a " need. " Look at the civil rights. There was a " need " and society changed. How about WWII? morals about what kind of work women should do rapidly changed because of a need. I'm just saying that things change for a number of reasons. Their own basis. Let's take a factory owner. He sees every day workers being horribly mutilated by machines. He has to settle with them and his profit margin decrease. The basis for brutal treatment is his own expierence, often because of the wallet. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Based on what? Again, What basis? So the basis is a need and not society? The need is the base for which morals change according to you now... however, you just said that it was society... why the change? Ok, so the basis is NOT society????<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Alot of stuff. Need is merely one cause of why society changes its morals. It is not the only thing. I'm just saying that things change for a number of reasons. His personal beliefs are not always tied to society. If we want to do that, nothing can ever be proven. As tasty said, such a argument is silly. Let's take this to a new level. No one can prove anything. Absolutes therefore do not exist at all becuase nothing can be proven to be a absolute. This is why you don't argue with a true skeptic! <br><b>S1:5-  </b>This was in response to the " what basis " question. So what stuff? And how does one decide which stuff to use from this " basis " when making a moral decision? Yeah, but once again this means that society is not the basis.. it is simply what changes because of a decision made from a basis. So once again the basis is not society as you said earlier? Exactly!!! I am glad we got here. With the relative mind set nothing can be proven and thus this leads to anarchy. Since we don't have that maybe we should come to a different conclusion.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Duo, I will happily respond to your last post to me if you so desire. But I think Symbiote has done a pretty good job at explaining what I was trying to explain. I have obviously taken it a little farther in asserting that an absolute moral standard does exist. But I take issue with the relativist position for the reasons Symbiote has stated. As such, I think my attempt to respond to your last post to me would be rather redundant, but If you wish, I will certainly do so.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What? I asked how something can be a apriori truth, which is something discovered not through empirical means yet be that at the same time? Not really. Symbiote has merely proved that neither can be proven. Your argument was that moral absolutism is correct and that moral relativism is wrong. Symbiote didn't argue that. So unless you have changed your position to that moral absolutism and relativism are unprovable, Symbiote has not done a good job at explaining your argument. So now your position has shifted? Then you contridict yourself in stating Symbiote has argued for your position when he clearly did not argue your original one. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No, my original argument was that diversity of opinion does not prove that morality is relative. I then went farther to say that I believe in moral absolutism and in an absolute moral standard. I never said I could empirically prove it. Obviously not. I will briefly refresh your memory. You said : to which I generally replied : to which you said : And I said And here you go again To which I said, and this is key : This is what Symbiote has pointed out I think. then you again : Here i go : you again : Me : Notice I said that I believe the standard could be known. Symbiote has argued that it is not possible to prove that morality is relative. Only that one believes it to be relative. I have done the same thing. Then I went on to talk about my belief in a moral absolute, which we never finished because you won't accept my first assumption. To which I finally said that accorging to your own standard, I could not accept your first assumption. This sounds a lot like Symbiote's point that neither can be proven to me. I'd like to know what Symbiote thinks about this. Symiote, did we essentially argue the same thing? lol, nice try Duo. I think the evidence shows otherwise.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But you did argue that there was a standard. Symbiote clearly wasn't arguing that at all. If you will recall, we left that discussion because it wasn't doing anything. It is not revelant in this one. And therefore could be provable. Symbiote did not argue this, he argued that you cannot prove either. Only if you keep shifiting your argument, yes. HUH? Explain. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I argued that I believed in a standard. I never said I could empirically prove it. Symiote argued my first point, that moral relativism couldn't be proved. The fact that I made a second argument that Symbiote doesn't address nor make does not mean we did not agree on my first argument. Not relevant? You apparently still subscribe to moral relativism, so it is still relevant to try to show you that this cannot be proven. I could offer evidence for my belief, but not the undeniable empirical evidence you were demanding of me. Thing is, you could not offer undeniable empirical evidence of your position either. So if something has to be proven empirically, why do you subscribe to moral relativism? I haven't shifted my argument. I thought you had accepted the proposition that your version of moral relativism had significant problems, the same problems in fact you were accusing my arguments of having. What kind of standard is it to demand of my arguments more than you demand of your own?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Symbiote does address your second argument, just in the opposite fashion. You have stated there are absolutes, yet you have not proven them to be absolutes. That part of the discussion did nothing but waste space. Actually, if i say it cannot be proven, doesn't that prove there aren't absolutes? :p I gave a reason to Symbiote. I suggest you find it. All I needed to do was prove that your absolutes were not absolutes. That I did. merely because you don't wish to address why they are absolutes outside of a " because I said so " doesn't make your claims absolute, it merley says you cannot refute the exceptions. * sigh* I suggest you read the entire thread. Reading such would easily find the answer to that : hint it has to do with assumptions of truth in morals. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You have not proven them not to be. No, because you can't prove that it can't be proved. :p Your reason rests on differing opinions, which proves nothing but the fact that differing opinions exist. You did not disprove my absolutes. I asked you to do so, using the example of genocide, but you declined saying that you already had. If you already had, why would I ask you again? Therefore you should conclude that I did not see your example as an exception. So maybe I was asking you to explain it a little more.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You have proven your unwillingness to prove the exceptions are not exceptions. I asked you to view it from the other side, you blantatly refused. This is getting very stupid very quickly. So will we agree neither side can be proven? [ qupte ] You did not disprove my absolutes. I asked you to do so, using the example of genocide, but you declined saying that you already had. [ / quote ] I already did. Merely becuase you wish to avoid discussing it doesn't make your argument correct. it is not my fault if you are too lazy or unwillingly to comtemplate a different view without embracing it. The sign of true intelligence is the ability to entertain an idea without embracing it.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Right there with ya! Spread the word!!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why are you folks pro-gun and against gun control? Philosophically I mean, not " it's in the constitution ". <br><b>S1:2-  </b>To me, owning a gun is no less a right than owning a refrigerator. To equate gun ownership to abortion is absurd<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Eh? I'm not equating them, I'm seeing if there is any correlation between them. That would be absurd :P <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I was responding to this and it seemed to me that you kinda were. Your point appeared to be that if the government can " control a woman's body " then why can't they tell us what to do with guns<br><b> S2:3-  </b>In a way I was, as far as the poll goes. Abortion and gun control use very similar arguments about personal responsibility and gov't intrusion into private lives, but the different sides, conservative and liberal, switch who use them. I wanted to see if what I observed would show up here. With what you say, you can flip it. Why can the gov't legislate morals in one area but can't in another. It's just the subject that changes. Both parties pick and choose their battles, it seems to me, and they sometimes contradict themselves. This is partly why I never subscribe to one or the other :P<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I noticed you very conveniently failed to mention that you were wrong about what the name of the bill in the congress is..........<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Eh? What are you talking about? The " partial birth abortion " bill? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You said the bill was not called the PBA bill Kuato corrected you<br><b> S2:2-  </b>lol. The issue was never about the name of the bill. I said there was no medical procedure called " partial birth abortion ". If you read it again, I said : That's great for you, but we're talking about the bill. It does not specify viable or not, nor is there any procedure called " partial birth abortion ". <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yhen why do they call the bill Partial Birth Abortion if there is no procedure called that?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Because if they make up a label, the bill is not limited to a single procedure or gestational age or anything like that. This allows a sort of " backdoor ban " in that it can be used for different procedures for prosecution purposes. Late term abortions ( what ignorant people assume this applies to exclusively ) are used to emotionally charge people. It's a political move to shift focus from early abortion to late abortion since most of the nation disagrees with late term abortions. The interest isn't in banning late term abortion ( there were bills created by democrats that would ban all late term abortion except in cases of grevious physical injury ), the interest is in riling up ignorant people such as yourself that know little about the issue and then dishonestly try to ban early abortions. D & X abortions ( the actual procedure that most associate this bill with, although the bill is not limited to this procedure ) account for less than 1 tenth of 1 percent of abortions performed, so banning just them doesn't really serve these decietful pro-life people's purpose. However, banning " partial birth " is much more useful, since it isn't limited to an actual procedure ( for no actual procedure called " partial birth " exists ) and it's useful for riling up emotions, isn't it? To sum up : For political purposes. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Or perhaps it was directed to non caring people like you who have no compassion or value for human life in the womb and can think only of her miserable selfish existence....... I think the latter applies..........<br><b> S2:4-  </b>haha, who says I'm a she? ;) You do know that when you say " the latter " it implies you had two options. I see only one. I should have figured you could not address the point of my response to you. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>You said you were a while back.... Your option and mine......... You did not address mine either except to attack me personally..... Just because you write a whole bunch of horse manure does not make it so.......<br><b> S2:5-  </b>haha truly? Could you quote me on that? I seriously doubt you can back this up? Nope, I said you were ignorant of the issues involved. I sincerely believe that. It isn't an attack, though it can be insulting. I addressed your question directly. Are you saying it isn't true? Perhaps you would care to debate it then :D <br><b>S1:6-  </b>1. you said it and its not important enough for me to look it up 2. you call someone ignorant. Is that a compliment in your mind? 3. I am saying its smoking mirrors...<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Voice Of Reason, No, I didn't :) No, but it's not an attack. It's a statement about your knowledge on the subject Which, of course, you have no intention of backing up. As usual :p Nurglitch, Because it doesn't simply state that " partial birth abortions " are banned, it's that they have a description within the bill that can apply to different abortion procedures. It's a bit like if I made a bill called the " happy fun time procedure ban " and in the bill itself described the " happy fun time procedure " as " Whenever a physician cuts open the skin for the purpose of removing a part of the body ". Despite the fact that there is no medical procedure called the " happy fun time procedure " doctors can be prosecuted under this bill if they remove tonsils or an appendix or a kidney for a transplant. It could also apply to donating blood, since the skin is punctured and blood is a part of the body. The wording is vague enough to do that.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I think it goes without saying that any time the mother's life is endangered then and abortion can take place............ As far as rape and incest if and abortion has to take place lets hope that it is before the last 3 months of the pregnancy........<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Then why have you attacked Kerry and other democrats for voting aganist abortion bills that did not have such clauses? Oh yes, I know why, because you're a lying hypocrite. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Because you hero Kerry is a hypocrite........ When he is in New England he is pro choice.. When he is in the bible belt he is pro life......... You can't have it both ways little man..........<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You obviously don't understand. No one wants you to get a abortion. You are still spouting that bull**** that the pro choice wants you to get a abortion. Pro choice merely respects your decision either way. You're still a lying hypocrite for attacking someone for doing what you support. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Little man is your real name John KerrY? you flip flop just like him<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Please. Why would I insult myself? That is ridiculous. How am I flip flopping? Oh wait, I'm not. You assume that I support right restricting laws even I support the intension of that law. WRONG. Amazing how you constantly avoid discussing what you quote.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Does it mean that we should? Merely because I agree that it should be banned doesn't mean I will support legislation that infringes upon the rights of women. I think alot of things should be done, but not at significent costs. The question lacks such questions. Again, you assume too much<br><b> S2:1-  </b>My induction is sound, and you have not showed it to be incorrect. You need to change your first statement before I will accept your arguments. I have clearly responded to what you said because I included your full statements in my argument, thus showing I have read the whole debate. If you have decided not to make your position clear, you shouldn't be commenting on this topic. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Your induction is based upon a assumption that is not true. I have clearly stated that while I think something should ____ that does not mean I support actual legislation when we account for other factors. That by itself invalides your claims. You need to realize the foundation of your argument has just evaporated. on the contrary, you clearly cited a quote where I was talking about how one should have paid attention to the debates, specifically to Kerry's speech. you failed to comment upon that in your response to such a quote. Therefore, if you are not actually paying attention, you shouldn't be commenting. Look at at Marc 9000, he makes insane comments that have nothing to do with what he quotes. Do you want to look like him?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So is it now safe to say that your initial claim " Partial birth abortion should be banned so long as there is a clause protecting the life of the mother " has now been amended to " Partial birth abortion should be banned so long as there is a clause protecting the life of the mother and other clauses that take into account other factors? " <br><b>S1:3-  </b>In a sense yes. The original question did not include other factors. Also, I wrongfully assumed that people would understand how legislation works and how it affects the rights and lives of the people. I now know not to assume that people will understand the complexities and that I must list how things really work. You have clearly taught me that people are not informed, do not understand how legislation works, clearly are ignorant of consequences and that it is wrong for me to assume the audience is educated. Steeeeve : cone, this is exactly what I am talking about. I cannot assume that the audinece is educated or informed, as Steeeeve here shows. Kerry has voted aganist other abortion bills for the same reason in his history. Vor has attacked his for those as well. While I realize you clearly do not know this, even after I provided the link to his history, you cannot assume there is only one bill. Under such, Vor is still very much a lying hypocrite.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Not informed? How so? Don't understand how legislation works? How so? Ignorant of consequences? How so? You are drawing outright faulty conclusions. The real case is that you were just confusing. The other stuff you assert is based out of the confusion you caused with your original statement. Why? You did not state your position on this issue. You misled readers of this topic by making the following claim : " Partial birth abortion should be banned so long as there is a clause protecting the life of the mother " when you really meant " Partial birth abortion should be banned so long as there is a clause protecting the life of the mother and a clause about other factors as well " As such, I think we have cleared the whole matter up by your admittance that your first statement did not represent your position. I just have a problem when people make a statement that would lead us to believe one thing ( in this case that you support banning partial birth abortion so long as one thing is included ) when the reality is another ( that you support banning partial birth abortion so long as more than one thing is included ). <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The evidence is right here. The fact that we are discussing it. The other stuff is because I wrongfully assumed you people would understand something other then the obvious. So how can I be a hypocrite? In all seriousness, the mere fact we are still talking about it is a sign that I assumed too much. represent my whole position? no. Part of it, yes. However, in dealing with such a simple, complexity avoiding question, I answered in a simple, complexity avoiding answer. The answer fit the question. I can live with that. I now know I cannot assume anything more then the basic knowledge of the audience.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>As far as I'm concerned, this should be the last thing I post about this, but I want it to remain clear that the reason the whole discussion came up is because it wasn't obvious what your position was. Now that it is, we can move on. also, I hope that's a complement to my style. If it is, Thanks :) <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I can live with that. It is. You have a much more refined style as well as few internal problems. Also, you don't ignore alot of stuff when it suits you. Not to mention you don't come blaring out like other people. It's very good, very nice use of tact. Steeeeve : I care. I cannot tolerate his lies, fabrications, and other dishonest behavior. As I have done before, you are more then free to look up his background at www.whistlestopper.com<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What is intresting is that conservatives will argue that the right to an abortion is not in the constitution because the words are not physically there. Then turn around and argue that the words do not mean what they physically say in this case http://www.mass.gov/legis/const.htm#cart048.htm. It can not be both. Either one believes in the physical nature or the words or interprtation. Sounds like conservatives are trying to have it both ways when it comes to issues they believe in.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I believe you are talking about the issue you raise in this thread. I'm fine with you discussing this issue in it's proper place ( here perhaps ), but I would prefer that you did not hijack this thread by injecting a discussion about homosexual marriage. The fact is, that irrespective of what the Constitution says about marriage, the fact doesn't change that the right to an abortion is not in the Constitution. In case it's been forgotten, the topic of the thread is " The Right to an Abortion is not in the Constitution. " <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I am not hyjacking this thread. I am pointing out the inconsistances of the conservative views on literal interpretation of the constitution ; by using an example of where the constitution phisically says one thing but the conservatives say it doesn't mean what it physically says. I have a feeling that if the right to abortion was physically in the constitution the conservatives would argue that the words won't mean what they physically say. BTW if you read back my post makes a statement about the topic of this thread.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>My point is that your point is moot. Regardless of what anyone thinks the Constitution says about whatever, it is an indisputable fact that the right to an abortion is not in the Constitution. In this case it does not matter if you are conservative or liberal. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So there is no discussion allowed?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So it wasn't a privacy issue before? Interesting. I invited your discussion in this post, I simply asked you to discuss it in the proper place. I notice threads tend to go on tangents, and I wish to avoid that as much as possible. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Let me rephase my question since it was stated that my point was moot and my response ws not understood. So no discussion of the topic of the interpretation of the constitution regarding abortion is allowed in this thread?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No, that is not what I am saying. what is not relevant is any inconsistancies some might have when discussing the Constitution as it relates to abortion and the Constitution as it relates to marriage. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>So if I had pointed to a santa clause case I would then be trying to hyjack the thread to talk about easter?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No it isn't. The 9th Amendment doesn't enumerate any rights itself.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I am actually impressed with your knowledge thus far in the constitution.... do you see abortion as a right guarenteed by the constitution? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No, I do not see it prohibited by the Constitution either. For me I wonder ; is a woman's right to choose what she does with her body one of her liberties that is protected by the 14th Amendment since that liberty is not specifically prohibited anywhere else in the Constitution?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I don't beleive that is up to a judge to decide. He doesn't get to define liberty. The only liberty that we know are the ones in the constitution. And abortion is not prohibited by the constitution, I agree with that. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Is a liberty a right?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I think it is confussing to say liberty and liberties. I also have wondered if, when written, liberty meant " to be free " as it is commonly meant.... as in you " free " as opposed to being a slave. This is more of a general liberty that doesn't really define much other than being free. This kind of fits with the other 2 which are life and property which seem to be general terms as well. You don't have a right to life no matter what. Even so you can have any of these taken away by Due Process of law. however, does liberty mean actual liberties as the courts now a days are thinking. IF this is true then there are certain liberties the constitution guarentees but what are they? I am not all certain this was the purpose of the word liberty. So maybe liberty is a right but a list of liberties to make up liberty is not. I hope this makes sense. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>What liberties are you referring to here?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Every view is taken on faith my friend. Even your " reasoning " is based on logic that is taken on faith.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>" faith " is believing in something in spite of the lack of evidence for it or the evidence against it. with logic, you believe in something because the evidence for it exists. logic is based on the predictable and consistent, faith is not. this is also why the amount of faith required to believe something varies as more evidence is added or removed. when you believe in somthing that is fully supported by evidence, no faith is required <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No, logic is based on faith as well. you say a =b and b = c therefore a = c. But all of this is a faith that a, b, and c exists and that " equals " exists. In logic you are accepting a very basic premise and coming up with conclusions based on that faith based premise.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>i can verify that a, b and c exists, and the concept of " equal " is both testable and consistently predictable. if 2 things are equal, they are the same. in mathematics, 2 equal things are of the same quantity. quantities are measureable. no faith required <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Like Beale said... you believe in the basics as being true... you can't prove they are in fact true. How you prove ' a ' exists? You don't.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>dude, ' a ' is a variable equal to a number i assign to it. if i say it exists, then it exists. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Just because you say so doesn't mean it is. " I say there is a God ".... I guess it must be true if we apply your standard. Just face it. You have faith in something even if you don't realize that you do.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>consider the sentence : " the cow jumped over the moon. " this is sentence exists, because it exists in my mind. the proof that the sentence exists is the expression of the sentence as you just read it. concepts, by nature, need no physical manifestation in order to exist. its a concept, and it exists the moment it is thought in the mind of anybody. a =b is a concept. both a and b exist, because they exist in my mind, and are defined in my mind as variable quanties of equal value. the proof that a and b exists is the expression i just wrote. no faith required not everything works this way. god is not defined as a concept, so god cannot be proven to exist simply by expressing that he exists. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Just like a and b. You just say you thought of it. Well, if I don't think a =b does this mean it doesn't exist? To a newborn they don't know what a or b are. They only exist so much as you have faith in their existence. You have faith in numbers and expressions... thats fine. You can't prove them at all.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>lol a exists because i think about it. you not thinking about a doesnt cause it to stop existing. the proof that a exists is the same as the proof that a sentence, song, image or shape exists. it exists as long as a single mind thinks it up. and it proven to exist when it is expressed in a way that is communicable to another mind. squares exist. the scale of C exists. the sentence " hello, world " exists. no faith required<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Since no belief system so far has been able to show any proof, no one belief system can be objectively claimed to be more valid than another - thus, they are all taken on faith, not proof. I think we agree that, since none can offer proof, laws should not be based on any one of them but purely on objective reasoning.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Every view is taken on faith my friend. Even your " reasoning " is based on logic that is taken on faith. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>As a scientist, I usually assume that generally accepted scientific views are correct since they have a preponderance of proof, unlike religious views that depend on leaps of faith. By " reasoning ", I refer to logical reasoning that does not need leaps of faith to understand or accept their veracity. That does not mean that I do not take religious leaps of faith - I do, though they are often hard to reconcile with scientific beliefs. However, I strongly believe that, in making laws that affect all people ( not just those of a particular belief system ), the reasoning behind these laws cannot include leaps of faith but be logically based on proveable concepts. On another subject : Does this mean that pro-lifers would be willing to compromise if exceptions for " women's health " were more narrowly defined? Here, I'm talking about compromises that would leave first-trimester abortions up to the mother's choice, and restrict only third ( and possibly also second ) trimester abortions.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Science is faith as well. You first have faith that experiments ( etc ) done in the based are correct. You also have a faith in existence. Science has just as many assumptions as religion does. In fact if we want to use logic then a logic mind would choose to believe in God. Unless you can explain to me the beginning you have taken large leaps of faith. Religion just happens to explain them while logic does not... and science uses the " big bang theory " which is aboug as much of a leap as the religious way. No. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Everything is a matter of degree. The assumption that the world exists ( as opposed to the idea that we are dreaming all of this ) is a basic assumption that everyone in the world makes in order to survive. Even those who ponder its non-existence have to assume its existence to run their everyday lives, so denial of such basic things as the existence of the world or the existence of " equals " ( which is an abstract concept devised by man, not an object - so its existence is automatic ) is merely an academic exercise with no basis in reality. We have to have basic assumptions that what we observe is reality in order to live. Science is based on observeable experience and bad science is usually eventually weeded out through peer review. Religious faith simply makes assumptions without demanding any observeable proof or even self-consistency. Everything is explained by the convenient reason that God is all-powerful and that we cannot know his purposes. If God actually did speak to me directly, then I might also believe in the improbable scenarios that most religious beliefs hold. Otherwise, we simply have the word of man that is supposed to be the word of God. Most of the time, given the corruptibility of human nature, I remain very skeptical when someone claims to know God's will.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>All this to say we have basic assumptions... you mean like a faith in something? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You seem to be saying that an assumption that the world exists is the same level of assumption as saying that God created the world and man, Adam and Eve were the original parents of all mankind, earthquakes happen due to God's wrath, etc. These are very different levels of assumptions. One ( the existence of the world ) is consistent with every experience all humans have ever had. The other ( religious dogma ) lies purely in the realm of people's imaginations - i.e. No one can demonstrate that any of it is true, it is only assumed as true and imagined, not experienced. Basically, the only way we can know the truth ( as opposed to simply guessing it ) is to experience it. Most things we know do come from the experience of others - where I trust scientists, you trust ancient sources written by men and the interpretation of modern men as to what they mean. The very large advantage of trusting scientists is that they show proof and this proof can be demonstrated time and time again.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>@ Adept Yes, sex can be recreational or procreational, but when a woman has procreational sex, she knows she is taking a risk that she will become pregnant. It just comes with he territory. The party analogy is flawed because someone deciding to squat and just live in your house and not go away is not a reasonable risk of throwing a party, but becoming pregnant IS a reasonable risk of having sex.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>When you walk through a dark alley at night you know you are taking a risk you will be stabbed, shot or mugged, therefore you have consented to it and are no longer allowed to defend yourself. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I don't see how you can possibly equate being shot, stabbed, or mugged with being pregnant. If you wanted to go as negative as possible, pregnancy is at worst an inconvenience, and I've never heard anyone calling a shooting an inconvenience. Secondly, if you are walking through a dark alley at night you are probably doing it because you have to, because otherwise, you probably would have picked another route. No one has recreational sex because they have to.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Missing the point, which is not about how " bad " pregnancy is. Just because you are aware of a risk does not mean you consent. So if you walk down an alley by choice, knowing there is a risk of mugging, you have consented to being mugged, is that it? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Sure it does. If you do something, knowing the risk involved, you have chosen to accept the consequences if that risk happens. If someone goes freeclimbing on a mountain, they know there is a risk of falling and dying. If that should happen, is it regrettable? Sure, but nobody blames the mountain or the ground. ( Similar answer as above ) If you walk down a dark alley, knowing there is a risk of being mugged and / or attacked and also knowing full well that there is a safer route, and then you get attacked, is it tragic? Sure, but it's also your own fault. Will I feel sorry for you? Of course. But I will also know it happened to you because you made a poor choice.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>If you get mugged, it might be your own fault. Not the muggers ' fault, your honour, the person who made the mistake of going somewhere shady looking. You're missing the point. It isn't about any other similarities a mugging and a pregnancy might have, its about addressing the idea that " if you know there is a risk, then you have consented to its worst results and should not be able to protect yourself from them ", whether the risk be human engineered or not. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Of course the mugger is to blame ( remember here that the mugger is not the same as the fetus as Galton pointed out ), but that doesn't change the fact that the person mugged had every opportunity to prevent the mugging by not going in the alley.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>http://www.l4l.org/library/notparas.html Might be worth a look<br><b> S2:1-  </b>They are a known anti-choice web site.

BTW, you know you won't ever answer my question because you know that to admit that you need the assistance of government to enforce your warped values means that you're on the wrong side of the moral issue involved.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yeah, just like all those who presently advocate using government assistance to enforce their warped moral value against murdering already born people are on the wrong side of that moral issue. The suggestion is absurd. I wonder how you, as a moral relativist, can even come to the conclusion that somebody is on the wrong side of a moral issue. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Obfuscation, bluster, blather, and bloviation. Why not simply admit up front that your " side " has FAILED in its pathetic attempts at moral suasion, and now you feel you need to resort to the force of law to impose your values on those who do not share them. Welcome to Brave New World!<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This is not at all what has happened. A quick survey of the history reveals that a sufficient number of people thought abortion was wrong to the degree that most state legislatures were persuaded to prohibit abortion in the years prior to Roe v. Wade. It wasn't the other way around. However, it took 7 Supreme Court justices exercising their power illegitimately to establish the right to choice. Therefore, it was the abortion movement that was ( and still has been ) unable to persuade the population at large that they are in the right. This is just a guess, but that may simply be due to the fact that the abortion movement has its roots in the morally bankrupt ground of eugenics and racism. The moral high ground indeed. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>NOT SO!! You have had 36 years to try to amend the US Constitution, and you have failed miserably. If there is such an upswelling of support, you and your ilk could have done it via the state convention route. The fact that you have not even tried shows the intellectual and moral bankruptcy of your position. The people of America, given a taste of choice, will not go back to being dictated to. The South Dakota vote last year provided ample evidence. :) Brown and West Virginia v. Barnette are proof of that. The women of America will never again be shoved to the back of the bus.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It took 77 years to amend the Constitution to prohibit slavery. Does this mean that banning slavery was not the moral thing to do, since it took so long to do so? It took 132 years to amend the Constitution to prohibit the practice of refusing women the franchise on account of their sex. Does this mean that it was not the moral thing to do, since it took so long to do so? So could the abolitionists and the suffragettes. That they were unable to do so means that they were on the wrong side of these respective moral issues? People have tried to amend the Constitution to overturn Roe. The mere fact that they have been unsuccessful does not mean they are wrong on the moral issue. We simply do not know this to be the case simply because the people of America have not been given the opportunity to express their will. The Supreme Court took that choice away from them. So much for getting a taste of choice. Polling data does indicate that the policy generally supported by the American public would not support legal abortion in roughly 90% of the cases that abortion is used today. Ample evidence of what? That the pro-life argument is wrong? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Whatever you do, don't insult the intelligence of those who post here. You and your ilk have had 38 years to spew your propaganda, so please spare us the hearts and flowers. You have had more than enough time to win the argument in this country ; the fact that you have not been able to do so speaks to its bankruptcy. Yes, it did take 70 + years to eliminate slavery, and now you want to overturn that as well and make a woman a slave to her fetus. NICE!!<br><b> S2:4-  </b>This is as ridiculous as saying that after 30 years, the abolitionists had enough time to win the slavery argument in this country ; and the fact that they were unable to do so speaks to the bankruptcy of their cause. Successfully persuading somebody that a fetus is a person entitled to legal protections has absolutely nothing to do with whether the fetus is, in fact, a person entitled to legal protections.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What you guys need to learn is that the soul has a different function than a brain.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The tooth fairy has a different function than the Easter bunny. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Some friendly advice, If you don't want comments about your age being written, then stop making such juvenile and off topic statements. Unless you're claiming that the brain and the soul are fictional, as are the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny? If that's the claim you're making, then you really need to get a clue and the first sentence I wrote is accurate.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The brain exists and has a function. Not so sure about the soul. This statement is not juvenile or off topic. You are using something fictional while debating, what could be more juvenile than that? And threatening another debater with the use of prejudice and ageism doesn't make you look intelligent. Calling BS on the use of something completely unproven is not juvenile or off topic. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I'm using something fictional while debating against something real?!?!? Really? Read your previous post and you'll clearly see that it was " YOU " who compared the tooth fairy to the easter bunny in comparison to the existence of the brain and the soul. So how do you then that I AM using something fictional? Stop playing the victim shooter. Nobody has threatened anyone at all, nor promoted prejudice against you at all. And you're being redundant by even using both words together since ageism means to be prejudice on the basis of a persons age. So show where I have promoted prejudice against you in any way! ageism |     j   iz   m | ( also agism ) noun prejudice or discrimination on the basis of a person's age. DERIVATIVES ageist ( also agist ) adjective & noun<br><b> S2:3-  </b>That was an analogy. You are using something fictional because you are factoring in the soul, which cannot be proven. " If you don't want comments about your age being written, then stop making such juvenile and off topic statements. " Really, archie? What " comments " would those have been?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>How is it that you can legally kill a burglar that invades your house, however for some reason when something invades your body you have no right to kill it?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You can only legally kill a burglar if you have good reason to believe that your life is in danger. Should you arrive one day at your house and discover a burglar who clearly poses no threat to your person, you may not legally kill him though he walk out with all your earthly possessions. Yes, the burglar may be infringing upon your liberty, but you may not kill him because of that. If you must analogize it to the burglar, than it would apply this way. Most pro-life people agree that abortions that are necessary to save the mother's life are acceptable. What most pro-lifers do not agree with is that abortion is acceptable in situations where only a person's liberty or property might be infringed, but where it would not be necessary to save her life. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not in all states. Most states have adopted castle doctrine by now. Still, invading a home is one thing, a body is another. Having something inside the plaster walls of your house is different than having something invasive inside of you.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The castle doctrine, though different in the various states that have it, still typically does not allow the use of deadly force merely to protect one's property. Take this connecticut explanation as an example : http://www.cga.ct.gov/2007/rpt/2007-R-0052.htm. It's actually an interesting read, in my opinion. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If someone broke into your house in order to cause you pain are you legally allowed to kill them?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>" Deadly physical force cannot be used unless the actor reasonably believes that the attacker is using or about to use deadly physical force or inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm. " I doubt that all pain amounts to " great bodily harm. " In that respect, it is very circumstantial. If someone breaks into your house and wants to punch you in the fact, but the victim does not perceive that the attacker is or is about to inflict deadly force upon him, then the victim may only repel the attack with the force that is reasonable to repel the attack. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>That fits the description. You know that the fetus is going to cause you pain. That's not necessarily true. If someone breaks into your house in order to harm you or cause you pain, you are legally allowed to respond with deadly force.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>babe, Nice rant ; now answer the question. Just in case you forgot, the question was, " If your 14 - year old daughter were impregnated as a result her of being molested by a family member, would you want the government to tell her that she had to bear the child so conceived? " The key here is the government. Still saying " Marxist " as though it were a bad thing, we see. BTW, just how " hefty " a fine are you proposing?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Cappy : Learn to read, I answered your question. As to : I would think that the fines would have to vary from State to State and be reflective of the cost of living index in each area. In an area like NY, something along the lines of $2,500 to the patient and $5,000 to the doctor performing the procedure. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Why you old softie you. You really do think that this small fine is sufficient sanction for, how did you put it again? Oh, yes, I have your words now, " Or, a woman can immorally and ( hopefully soon to be ) illegally choose to find an abortionist to rip the growing life from within her. " Whoever would have thought that the babe would be soft on crime. ;) BTW, it's nice that YOU approve of abortion in the case of rape or incest, but that wasn't the question at all. The question was about how you would react if the government said your 14 - year old granddaughter had to carry the baby to term.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Cappy : Liar. Your question, which you accused me of not answering and which I answered again ANYWAY but now you wish to " edit " was : I replied, AGAIN, that I approve of abortion in the case of rape or incest where a pregnancy has resulted as the result of the woman's / young lady's free will being violated. What is it about my answer that you are unable to grasp? You continue to display your cognitive dissonance by accusing me of having gone " soft " on the abortion issue by recommending fines in the $2500 / $5000 neighborhood and then start bawling about how abortion will only be available to the rich. Which is it Cappy? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The part that is an answer to the question. Once again, it's not relevant what you think the law SHOULD say ; it's what you would say / feel / do in the situation where the law forbids what you approve of - abortion " in the case of rape or incest where a pregnancy has resulted as the result of the woman's / young lady's free will being violated. " Remember that in Sarah Palin's ideal world and in the world of the true believer in the righttofetallife movement, the exemption you seek would be precluded. In that event, would you take her for an " illegal " abortion, knowing that both you and the doctor would be fined a relatively paltry sum? BTW, I love watching you go ballistic when I quote your words back at you, especially those relating to choices and sanctions. That's not twisting a thing, sweetie ; I just quote you and stand back waiting for the explosion.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Cappy : My, you're up early. Oh? Well, the law says a 14 year old can get an abortion without parental consent, whether the pregnancy is the result of rape or not. I think that's disgusting. Speculating as to what the Supreme Court might rule if Roe vs. Wade were to be reintroduced under a McCain / Palin white house is just that, pure speculation. Archangel posted results elsewhere in this forum regarding general opinion on the issue of rape and abortion and I am of the opinion that despite Palin's very fundamental religious beliefs, the vast majority would agree that such a condition is worthy of being an exception. Therefore your question, rephrased 20 ways to Sunday, is moot and ridiculous. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Still refusing to give a direct answer, we see. Tell us, were you the victim of a Jesuitical education? The question still remains, in the situation where, despite the protests, a profetallife Congress passes an antiabortion law with no exceptions - none, nada, bupkus, zilch - and if your 14 - year old granddaughter is impregnated by a molesting family member, will you break the law or encourage her parents to break the law, knowing that the worst penalty is a paltry fine? Yes, it's a hypothetical situation at the present, but the real time profetallife screamers, Palin included, are pushing for just such a law. After all, if we should adopt their idiotic reasoning that " Abortion is Murder ", then how can the nation sit back and permit some murders? BTW, for all you know, I may be up LATE!! :)<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Cappy : Duh! How big of you to admit that instead of calling me a liar for not responding to your constantly morphing question. Just as it's not relevant what you think the law MIGHT be changed to. Good night, Cappy. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Oh but it is. Even as I write, the profetallifers are organizing to create a law and / or Constitutional Amendment to do just that. Here in Colorado the people will vote this November on an Amendment to our Constitution defining a person as existing from the moment of conception. What do you think will happen to abortion in this state if that absurdity should pass?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Sigma, Beware of those here who would hijack the debate so that it is fought on their terms. The issue is privacy vs. big brother government reaching into what must needs be a very private matter. Let's keep focused.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>My posts do not deviate far from that topic, as far as I can see. Or is this thread more for the moral aspect of private life vs. governmental intrusion? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>As you can see, many posters here go on endlessly about the ( im ) morality of abortion, yet they become strangely silent when confronted with the question of the extent to which government can / should intervene in personal matters. The pro-choice folks here have no objection to those profetallifers who would apply the " no abortion " rules within their own families, but we have strong objection to having the law make that choice for our families. I have 3 daughters of child bearing age, and two granddaughters who soon will be. I will fight to the last to keep the decision of whether or not they carry their pregnancies to term where it belongs - with them. If they choose to give birth, I will love them and their child ( ren ) ; if they choose abortion, I will love them just as much. Just keep the law out of the decision.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Aye, it has changed little in the four years I have been registered. It is a delicate issue for both sides. Keep in mind that were there no other issue involved then allowing the fetus to grow and develop would be so obvious as to almost disallow debate. While I agree that there is virtually no benefit that would justify the cost of the loss of freedom that would necessarily occur were the gov't to disallow abortion, we cannot lose sight of the fact that there is a reason for the opposition. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I can understand that there may or may not be a reason for opposition to abortion in a particular family. What I can never understand is how that opposition can be transferred, via the overweening power of government, to anyone else's family. I'm out for tonight.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Like anyone on any issue, every person thinks what he or she believes is reasonable. If it is reasonable, those who believe the opposite are unreasonable. It's a natural desire to want the law to support reasonable beliefs.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Charlie horse : You can't. Why? Because emotions, by and large, are human characteristics. Bringing a new human life into the world is an emotional issue. Preventing that new human life from entering this world is an emotional issue. The condition of becoming pregnant is most often due to hormonally controlled emotions at the time of conception. Everything about the abortion issue is emotional. Deal with it.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Everything about war is emotional too. Does that mean emotion should be factored into starting wars? People would be starting wars because another country " hurt their feelings ", or we wouldn't go to war with threat country because " what if someone dies "? You can be emotional whenever you want. Emotion should never be factored into making laws, especially laws that will cause emotional hardship for some people. Intellectual thought and rationality should be the basis for our legal system. Not " emotions ". <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Then by your reasoning, Roe vs. Wade should never have been brought to court and decided. Ok, I'll go with that.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Is that so? Obviously every law has some emotion behind it, but it should be soley based on facts and logic. Do you disagree? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Shooterandproud : Again with your inconsistent line of reasoning. First you insist : Then when I say, well, if that's the case, Roe vs. Wade should be overturned you reply with : Roe vs. Wade was a decidedly EMOTIONAL decision in favor of those who don't wish to endure the EMOTIONAL distress or inconvenience of carrying a pregnancy to term. You can't have it both ways.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes, I can. Everything has emotion behind it, however basing something soley on emotion is stupid. Every law we make is because of emotions, however logic and reason are the primarily what are used when deciding to or not to enact a law. Making a law that says anyone who bullies another should be sent to a work camp and spend their lives there is based on emotion, however it is not logical. The law against murder however, is to deter more murders from happening and therefore stopping murders, preventing emotional distress. This is logical, because society would degrade if murder were legal. Making abortion illegal however, is based soley on emotion. Sure, seeing things that slightly resemble humans being killed can be emotionally disheartening, however when logic, reason, and science are used you will discover that these little creatures have no mental existence. Therefore, there is no reason for them to have rights, because mental existence is the basis for rights.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I just find it hypocritical that if I punch a pregant woman in the stomach and she misscarries I murdered someone while if she got an abortion its a-ok. Like huh? Is it a human or not people! Everyone who hits pregant people should be charged with assualt not murder if the fetus dies its a fetus not a person after all! Hypocritcal judges.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What is even more hypocritical is that if the woman dies while giving birth to this unwanted ZEF, that it is not held accountable for her murder! <br><b>S1:2-  </b>* facepalms* I highly doubt the ZEF wanted its source of food and shelter dead. Heck using that arguement I can blame the mother for her body not being fit enough to carry a child to term if she miscarries. Therefore by not keeping herself healthy she killed the ZEF. Ugh... I'm pro-choice but some of choicers arguements make me disgusted. ZEF's don't count as being human ( unless of course someone other than a licensed physican with the apporval of the mother kills it : roll eyes : That makes buckets of sense ) and no person under the age of 7 can be tried for murder anyway. >_> What's next we start sending little kids who steal candy from the store to jail?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So then you admit that the ZEF was manipulating " its source of food and shelter " for its own good, which is exactly what a parasite does. Weird. BTW-many parasites kill their host. Sorry, try again. First of all it's HER body, and therefore her property and she can do with it as she pleases. Second of all that's not why women have miscarriages Criminally negligent homicide works just as well <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And last I checked the ZEF didn't kill the woman because it wanted too. >_> And most human beings can argueably be considered parasites anyway. Ugh nevermind you think the ZEF is some alien life form that should either have all or no human rights. I agree. Its an object. So if I kill it I assaulted the woman nothing more nothing less. There is no mother right to choose to get rid of her offspring its a mother's choice to get rid of something growing inside of her. And if I make that choice for her I simply attacked her body I didn't kill anyone. ^_^ There's no one to kill.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Tell that to the dead pregnant woman BTW-a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that a pregnant woman is more likely to be a victim of homicide than to die of any other cause. One of many reasons that I could understand why a pregnant woman - wouldn't want to be pregnant anymore If by alien you mean illegal alien :p I would rather give rights to an alien life form, then to a ZEF. At least it isn't leeching off the woman against her will ;)<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I am not a lemming, so I don't follow lemmings like you appearently do.

The Constitution says what it says ( 1 st. amendment right to speak, assemble and petition the government included ) The biological facts surrounding human reproduction are what they are and the values that we as a society are willing to place upon all of it is ever shifting. In the end, someone's values will be reflected in our laws. Be it yours, mine or someone elses. Rather than seeing it as one persons views being forced upon another,... I see it as a reflection of the values of the people as a whole. Values that we are all free to challenge, discuss and petition for and against equally under the 1st. Amendment. I'll not make any " deals " which run contrary to my 1st. Amendment rights.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Interesting response. I like the thinking here. If you are saying that each person must find her / his own truth, I could not agree more. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I'm saying a little bit more than that. Yes, I agree that all people must be free to seek their own truths in life. But, no-one has the right to infringe upon the rights of others in their quests for their truth, convienience or anything else. So, it's not quite as simple as you would like it to be.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Exactly so!! :) Therefore, there should be no law whatsoever regarding a woman's right to choose whether or not to take her pregnancy to term. If the profetallifers are correct, moral persuasion should suffice ; if not, they have lost the battle in the marketplace of metaphysical concepts. Establishing law in the are is symbolic of their loss in the clash of ideas. As Richard Cardinal Cushing, John F. Kennedy's confessor once said, " Any faith which needs the force of law to enforce its tenets is not worthy of the name. " <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I see,.. so you must agree that Roe v. Wade is un-Constitutional law,.... You just think it's un-constitutional because it doesn't give a woman full control over whether or not she wants to carry to term. Thanks for holding true to your positions, Chester. The contrast and clarity you are lending to this issue is priceless!<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Not at all. RvW was a masterpiece of judicial restarint. If you have read it, you know this. Mr. Justice Blackmun went out of his way to say that the Government will not be put in the position of picking and choosing among the varying metaphysical answers to the question of the beginning of life and therefore leaves the question in the hands of each pregnant woman to choose the answer that is most congruent with her own answer to the question. Did the decision go far enough? No, but it's a good starting point. It was about as far as the Court felt it needed to go in 1973. I would as strongly oppose a law or decision which requires abortion as I do one which would outlaw it. The government which today may prohibit abortion may well be the same government which tomorrow will require it. The government which claims to power to do either violates human rights. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Yet, when we live under a Constitution which states that a " person's " rights can not be denied except by due process,... it is inevitable that someone's definition of when a " persons " life begins will have to prevail,... incidently, I disagree with your take on the " metaphysical " aspects. The one thing we all have in common as " human beings " is our biology,... The logic would follow that a biological " persons " rights should begin when their biological life does. the metaphysics.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The I suggest you start with trying to be honest then.

You really ought to try that honesty thing. An you quoted him, why? Are you now saying he supports you, having just insulted him? However, I agree that it is a deep philosophical question. Explain. Well, let's take a look at the bit you quoted. You highlighted the bit that said " human being ", thinking that this alone would back up your argument, but you failed to notice the words " the process that begins to make a " in front of it. So, if Clinton is saying that the " cells join in the process that begins to make a human being ", then they cannot yet be a human being. So, he certainly does not support your argument. I am still amazed that you would use this quote to support your argument, when it clearly does not.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I haven't misrepresented your views one bit.

" sinjin - no brain activity, no person.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>This thread is about the biological " beginning " of a human individual's life. If you can't stay on that topic, perhaps I can get a moderator to help you along. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>No brain, no sentience, no person. I think I'm right on topic. It matters not whether the brain has yet to develop sufficiently or has ceased to function forever. There is no " person " there. I understand where your original baiting was going. At some point you intended to substitute " person " for " human " and / or " individual " as you have already done in another thread. Intellectually dishonest IMO but I'll leave that for others to decide for themselves. You aren't worth my time.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>READ IT CAREFULLY! " This thread is NOT about when " personhood " begins " it is about when a human individual's life begins BIOLOGICALLY. Take your " when a person becomes a person " comments to another thread. They are NOT germane to this debate. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Really? And what of this? http://www.4forums.com/political/sci...tml#post345652 That thread isn't about when personhood begins either. What a piece of work you are. Now I'm really done.<br><b> S2:8-  </b>In the context of this thread, as it IS germane to this deiscussion, that quote is about CONCEPTION being the moment that a persons " aging process " begins,... NOT about when their " person-hood " begins. READ IT CLOSELY.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Has anyone seen the cartoon animation on the planned parenthood site? Hilarious. Go to planned parenthood site, click on pregnancy, and then on the " how pregnancy occurs " flash animation. I was not sure if I would be allowed to link it here. Warning : may not be suitable for some viewers, especially those with no sense of humor.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It was interesting.... Like always though, PP doesn't do a great job of giving the full story. When pregnancy begins is up for debate just like everything else... although I don't see why it matters really. http://www.advancedfertility.com/earlypre.htm It is what it is no matter what you call it. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>But in the terms of this debate, it does not matter when pregnancy begins. I didn't mean to use the cartoon as an argument, I just thought it was hilarious. As far as your other question above about the 99% of " regular abortions ", I guess I would answer this. Personally, I only could support the decision for my wife to have an abortion in the events of danger to her health, or rape. However, I do not think that I have any right ot push my beliefs on others, and what is right for me, might not be right for someone else. Do I agree with abortion being used as birth control, no. But, do I think some people make the best choice by terminating an unwanted pregnancy rather than bring another unwanted child into the world... yes.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I will just restate what I was referring to earlier... there is no " best choice " when it comes to whether or not you can take the life of another ( unjustly... ie non-self defense ). I can't think of any situation where it would be ok for me to kill my neighbor and for it to be just. Even if they caused my life to be a living hell ( and oddly they do sometimes ). I am all for pushing my beliefs on other people when it comes to harming someone. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And this is the problem. Anti-abortion advocates view the fetus as " someone ". Pro-choice advocates view the fetus as " something ".<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No arguement there. I honestly think it is harder to show that the fetus ( unborn at any stage ) is not person / human then to show it is. If the unborn is not a human then what is the unborn and since when does something go from nonhuman to human?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Yes, that is generally the main debate, because the fetus has not done anything to deserve to get aborted. Yes, she does. But, she has had sex, and thus as a consequence, should carry the baby. Then if she does not want the baby, she should put it up for adoption. So it can go to a family who desperately wants a baby.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And the mother has not done anything to be forced to give birth. So sex is only a privelage for those who can phisically give birth? Abortion is not Black and White as you are trying to paint it to be. It's much more complicated. Having a baby, even giving it up, causes a lot of emotional and phisical pain, and most people just cant have babys. They cannot care for it, and they cannot bear to be thinking that their child is out there somewhere. As I have said before, this is much more complicated than you think. Abortion should always be availible in the first and maybe second trimester, so that women wont have to live the rest of their life in fear and abstinence because they cannot support a baby. This is an interesting article : http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15173072/site/newsweek/ I would suggest reading it, just to get a better Idea of our position. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Why do I think that she has inherent value? Because she's a person. Since when is having sex not doing anything? Sex is something, therefore having sex, is doing something. In other threads, I've said that it isn't black and white. For those who can not physically give birth ( those who it would kill or seriously hurt ), I support abortion for. And you think that killing your baby doesn't cause any emotional and / or physical pain?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Glad you figured that part out. Sex is a norman part of a healthy relationship. What about those who cannot emotionally or financially support a Baby. What if I told you you were pregnant right now ( lets just assume you're a girl ), and that abortion was illegal. It would suck, your future would be ruined, and you probably wouldn't be able to lead a normal life again. You have no Idea what women go through when they're pregnant. Much less so if any. There is no post-abortive psycosis, or whatever. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yes, but it also has consequences. I don't know, you may not have heard of this new thing, it's called adoption. Right now, you are assuming. And, as I told georged in another thread a minute ago, don't assume, as you make an XXX out of u and me. So, back to what you said, how do you know that I don't have a 16 year old pregnant sister / friend / other? You said it would suck. Yes, it would suck a little bit, but I decided to have sex, fully knowing the consequences, and now I would have to deal with it. Actually yes, I could live a normal life. I could continue to go to school, give birth to the baby, and then give the baby up for adoption. It would be hard, yes, but possible. I'm sorry, I was refering to those selective people who have a conseince.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No, thats what we have abortion for. Most women can't handle adoption, next... You are painting this as such a black and white issue. You cant just not have sex. You cant just put the baby up for adoption. Many women can become emotionally unstable and maybe even hurt someone else or themselves after giving birth. Its not black and white. Abortion is the only option for most women, and taking that option away would not only be morally wrong, it would be downwright primitive. We dont need extra babys. Unwanted children means poverty and crime, we don't need all of these unwanted children. What would be the point of having them? There are waay too many children no one gives a XXXX about in this world. Have you read that article that I posted yet? I think you might find it interesting. After having a baby, most people arent worrying about their conscience. Even when they're pregnant, they whole lifestyle is in danger. Most women cant have a baby because they cannot emotionally and financially support it, therefore most of them must have an abortion, and many of them feel sad about that. As I said before, READ THAT ARTICLE! <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Your statistics are useless as they don't concern babies. As babies don't go to foster care. There are people on one to two / three year WAITING lists to adopt a baby. Also, I don't understand why killing your baby would cause less emotional pain, as opposed to giveing it to a loving family. Why? Are we that much of animals, that we can't control ourselves? Is it physically impossible to be celibate?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Frankly, im not concerned with a fetus at the moment. Im concerned with the living human being, who feels pain and sorrow, who's life you are about to throw away if you criminalize abortion. You still havent answered my question, why do we need all of these extra unwanted babys? And I also refer you to the quote I posted before. Have you had sex before? I havent, but it is foolish of you to make these assumptions. Sex is part of a healthy relationship and life, and no one will live in abstinence just because they have a chance of having a baby. That's what abortion is for. I refer you to my signature, why do you feel that the government should seize women's reproductive rights and take away their personal choice and freedom? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Well that's your problem, because I am. So just because they're unwanted, doesn't mean that they don't deserve to live? What if one of those aborted babies, may have been the person who discovered the cure for cancer? Have you ever thought of that?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>" If your morals or your religion are getting in the way of your politics, you're not helping anyone. We don't have civil rights so we can be politically correct. We have civil rights so we can be different and offensive. " - madmike, 2/18/04 What if the woman who was forced to have babys discovered the cure for cancer, but couldn't pursue her dreams because she had to care for her children. They don't deserve to live if they are living inside of another, sucking up all of their resources, and causing them emotional pain and suffering. Actually, Its up to the mother. The mother knows the circumstances best, you do not. Therefore, she must make the descision for the child, not you, not the government.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Sorry you misunderstood my post. I was simply stating that according to the law, abortion is not murder in the United States. That is a fact. You are also correct that human slavery as well as indentured servitude are presently illegal in the US. Forcing a woman into compulsory gestation for months, a mandatory labor and a requisite birthing process is illegal as well. But in service to your personal beliefs I guess you think that it is acceptable.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Actually, there are exceptions to that statement. For example, a murderer that also causes the death of a fetus can be charged with a double homicide. Since that's possible, then there must be instances in which the State see abortion as murder. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>There aren't. If you find any please let me know.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Careful, your ignorance of the law is showing. :) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You are correct. I should have been clearer. I was speaking of abortion as a medical procedure.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Again, from my previous reference. " Some of these laws do not contain exceptions for the woman or her doctor, which could possibly allow criminal proceedings for measures taken as a course of treatment ( radiation treatment for cancer or antibiotics ) or for abortion. " <br><b>S1:4-  </b>There are many laws on the books that the Supreme Court has determined are unconstitutional. That is why you will hear legal scholars ( even conservative ones like Justice John Roberts ) say that Roe v. Wade is the law of the land. That is why you do not see any states prosecuting a woman for murder when she has had an abortion. There are also laws on the books ( such as in Texas ) against oral sex, interracial marriage and other things. A lot of the times state legislatures do not repeal all the specific laws that are rendered unconstitutional because of a Supreme Court decision. They just law fallow and are rendered useless. So technically you are right that the laws still exist, but legally they are not enforceable or technically legal -- which is what I was addressing.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Rread the following link and you'll see that we aren't talking about archaic laws that just haven't been repealed. Many are recently enacted laws that probably haven't been enforced against abortions because the " time " wasn't right. In PA, the law has been challenged on the basis of Roe v Wade and was upheld. http://www.nrlc.org/Unborn_Victims/S...aws092302.html<br><b>S1:1-  </b>you state what law says you have to accept the consquences of your actions? Anything thats against law..... it means you take responsibiliy for what happens. There are many laws that say if you give someone an STD you can go to jail. and yeah, if you have sex you consent willingly to the possibility you might get an STD or pregnant... then you live with the consequences of your choice. If they are so hard then why do we have them? If they cause that much pain while are they legal? Also... whats the womens rights stuff? Do women have more rights then men? I think we all have equal rights... at least in the US.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So you oppose the treatment of STDs. Your position is duly noted. Heart surgeries are hard and cause a lot of pain. So why don't we just stop doing them? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>What? When did I say you can't treat STDs... treating an STD doesn't exactly kill a person. I guess you can not have heart surgery if you don't want... you are just dooming yourself.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Just like you can or cannot have abortions depending on whether yu want to or not. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No... this kills a kid.... I don't see why anything would trump the right to live.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>There is no kid your prolife hyperbolic revisionist linguistics none withstanding. Well, right now a kidney patient is close to death at your local hospital. Your extra kidney would save him, and per his right to life that nothing can trump, you must present tomorrow mornign to give him your extra kidney so he can continue to live the live. After all, his right to life trumps your right to control what happens to your body. Let me know how the surgery went, OK?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I agree, If you choose to have sex you know you might get pregnant... one also knows the things that go along with pregnancy. However, by having abortion people don't really care about having safe sex or no sex because they can always kill off the baby if needed. If one didn't have sex until they wanted children, or had safe sex, then we could reduce abortions by like 90% or something. Time to take responsibility for ones actions.... have sex and get pregnant then take care of your child. Why does a dad have to give up his resources for the child with child support? That doesn't seem fair... maybe they didnt want the kid... does that give them the right to not take care of it?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>BLAH BLAH BLAH Not a valid argument from you. Your policy for pregnant women applies accross the board - her ppregnancy - her responsibility - her consent not required, so your preaching responsibilty rings really, really hollow. Nobody has to be a parent - safe haven laws, adoption, signing away parental rights, etc. Plus this is cute. Have you noted the stats on dead beat dads? Every woman I know who has been awarded child support has trouble getting it, if they get it at all. I was awarded 25% of my ex-husband's income in child support. Never seen one thin dime. Doesn't call or write neither. That's OK - he be a big booger of a loser and we got someone better, now. But really, get a reality check. Statistically speaking it's not the moms who aren't pulling through in the world of parents. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>??? Not a valid arguement why? I just was stating two things there.. 1 ) having abortion legal may actually lead to an increase in abortions 2 ) having sex only when you want children would lead to a decrease in abortions. this seems pretty logical Two your second point... maybe we should do more about dead beat dads. ------- Once again with the kidney thing... you look at it the wrong way... there is not much of a comparison. If you have a kidney disease that requires another kidney this is by no means my fault or from anything I have done. I am not killing this man... he is being killed by a disease. In this case I have a choice to help this man live. Lets look at abortion, The women has the kid in her. She decides to get it killed. This is directly killing the baby... you are the reason the baby dies... in the case of the kidney man... the disease is. Does that make sense now?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It's the " if you are gonna have sex you have to be ready to accept the consequences ' argument I do not buy from you, because you don't make exceptions for rape victims. Responsibility and consent in sex are irrelevant to you since you feel that ANY pregnancy that a woman is faced with is her responsibility period. Drop them off something tall? I am gonna beat you with the stupid stick ( this is what I tell my son when he frustrates me ). Nothing seems to happen in the woman's world to you except the sex act and conception. You don't see another matter. " She just decides to kill it... la la la. " It's so insulting. She is not picking out a freaking hand bag. SHE HAS REASONS. Plus it is getting danged tedious watching the men on this board talk about pregnancy like it an't no big deal. Hate to break it to you all - you DO NOT KNOW. Nor can you. ( And being supportive while the wife was pregnant does not qualify as a pregnancy. ) I am not saying this to say you shouldn't have a voice - but you all trivialize women and pregnancy. It makes me want to kick you. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I thought we already established that were not talking about rape here? We are just talking about " normal " cases. And in this case when you have sex you are erady to accept the consequences. You still don't get the money from them, but I would be sure to look the other way if this were to happen :p I dont understand this as it relates to what were talking about ( donating a kidney or something ). We aren't talking about what a women does in her life other than if she is pregnant and getting an abortion You can kick me all you want, however, I can take it. The unborn can't live when one kills it. You are right, I will never know how a pregnancy feels but this doesn't matter. If I were a women would my opinion be more valid? There are a lot of women out there that agree with what I do. Once again this is not a man vs women debate and I feel that many think it is. I think I am finding some common reasons for common pro-choice beliefs.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It's relevant. nIf your opinion is that all pregnancy MUST be continued rgardless of the woman's resposnibility or consent - then preaching responsibilty rings hollow.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>OK, fair enough. What say we just leave it up to the woman to make those decisions and if they choose life, they are on their own. The man has no say and therefore no responsibility. Deal?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>No say and no responsibility, eh, Cap? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>According to Jitobear.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>According to jitobear, all men are bad. Especially those with uncompromising principles. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I also think that Jitobear may have been dealt a bad hand in her life and has her own reasons for believeing the way she does and I don't think it is in us to ever understand. Whatever her past, I just want her to know that even though we may disagree from time to time, I am not insensitive to her position and I will never intentionally disrespect her for feeling the way she does. Theres the outside possibility that she, for reasons of her own, may have had an abortion herself and doesn't take too kindly to those who criticize this practice as this is intrepeted, by her, as an indictment on her character. But, that is only a guess. She did mention that a man bailed on her and left her high and dry. I can understand her bitterness towards men even if I don't agree with it. None of my commentary is pointed directly at her but you know what they say, if the shoe fits, wear it. If not..... no worries.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But what bothers me is the fact that I'm pointing out legitimate alternatives to abortion, and yet she still thinks abortion is the end-all, be-all solution to all of women's problems.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>1. life begins at conception. 2. a 6 - celled zygote is a human. 3. abortion is the act of killing a human. the issue about abortion is not whether its killing a human, but whether it should be considered immoral and illegal. i see no reason to consider abortion any more immoral than masturbation, menstruation or sex with contraceptives, and i've given reason, which i can reproduce on demand. there is no way abortion can be legally considered murder, since an unborn baby has no legal rights, also for reasons i've previously given so abortion is neither immoral nor illegal<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Unkerpaulie is a murderer and has no moral conscience according to what he has written above. - theo <br><b>S1:2-  </b>care to elaborate? or are all your arguments made of baseless and unsupported presumptions<br><b> S2:2-  </b>What do I need to elaborate on? Your statements are pretty clear... unless you'd like to recant. - theo <br><b>S1:3-  </b>who have i murdered? what makes me less moral than you? you pretty much have no argument<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Did I say anything about being more moral than you. Now that is a strawman arguement! Basically if you openly support that killing a human is not immoral... that is basically murder and a lack of a moral conscience. - theo <br><b>S1:4-  </b>excellent. we both are murderers and have no moral conscience. no recanting necessary<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No. I just said that I didn't say anything about being more moral than you. I also didn't say that killing a human being was acceptable. In fact my defense of the developing human being shows I have a moral conscience and also shows that I do not desire to support abortion which is murder. A sperm or egg by itself is not a human being and will not develop into one and therefore if one should die it is not murder. - theo <br><b>S1:5-  </b>i said a sperm and egg PAIR, not a sperm by itself. a sperm / egg pair can develop into a human, if allowed to fuse. by denying the fusion of the sperm with the egg, and furthermore by killing the sperm and the egg, you are killing the human before it has a chance to be concieved. you are killing the conponents that the human is made of, aborting its life at a stage earlier than conception. you remind me of someone that used to post here... i am asking you bluntly : are you more moral than me? your disregard for the human in its earliest stage of development : the moment before the cells are fused, undermines your claims of having moral conscience. you support contraception, which is the act of killing unfused sperm and egg pairs. a sperm cell is a living thing, and so is an ovum. when fused they begin a new living thing which grows into a baby. when unfused, they still contain everything needed to create a new living thing which turns into a baby. please explain how killing an unfused sperm / ovum pair is morally better than killing a fused ovum / sperm pair<br><b> S2:5-  </b>You know it erks me to spend alot of time with this ridiculous rehtoric with many of you and so sometimes I just like to play these word games back at you guys to give you some of your own medicine. To answer you bluntly, I am not more moral than you. I'm a sinner and you are as well. However, I do not subscribe to the belief of murdering the joined sperm & egg which is a human being. I've already explained the difference between the egg and sperm by itself. Read above. - theo <br><b>S1:6-  </b>thanks for not beating around the bush. i would just like to point out your condescending tone in accusing me of being a murderer and having no moral conscience. my point is that you have no right to be so judgemental to anyone that supports the choice of abortion, because abortion is no more the act of killing an unborn baby than is contraception. abortion is an alternative form of contraception, although you may not want to look at it that way. the purpose of abortion is to allow people to have sex without becoming parents. this entails destroying the cells that would otherwise develop into a baby. the purpose of contraception is to allow people to have sex without becoming parents. this entails destroying the cells that would otherwise develop into a baby. your view, that it is ok to destroy the material that babies are made of via contraception, yet morally bankrupt to destroy the material that babies are made of via abortion, makes no sense to me, but that is your view and i will leave it as that. however, by what i just said, and by your own admission, you have no right to make judgements about anybody's morality, so please refrain from doing so<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Oh? Let's see, increased risk of infertility, increased risk of breast cancer, ovarian and uterine cancer, ectopic pregnancy, botched abortions leading to severe hemmoraging. And let's not forget the psychological effects, also : Post-abortion trauma, depression, suicide, need I go on? Your claim that abortion is less threatening to the woman is bogus.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I think whether abortion or pregnancy is riskier depends on access to safe medical care and the health of the mother. Whether a rape victim will experience more stress aborting or carrying that pregnancy to term will depend on the life circumstances, health and mind-set of woman. I know good and well I could abort a pregnancy of rape and not blink an eye. As it is - both Captain America and Bassman have never been through either methinks. I have never had an abortion but - PREGNANCY SUCKS! :p <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Probably because we're both hmm... let's see,... uhhhh?? men? :) BTW, did you check out the website?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>EXACTLY! :p No, but I have seen the kinds of stats you are talking about before. Anyway, no number of stats will change my mind. It is infinately insulting to me as a grown woman that some total stranger thinks they know better than me what is best for my life, health, and state of mind. Abortion needs to be reduced by addressing how we raise girls, education, access to medical care and birth control and by helping women get all their needs met when pregnant. The right to make their own decisions should under no circumstance be taken from them. Ever. I have been raped and I have been a battered wife. I will break the neck of the next person who thinks they have any rights over my body for any reason. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>But does that mean that you need to be angry? Let me tell you of a person who was angry because a grievous injustice commited against him. Me. Now, I will not even pretend to know what it was like to be raped. Nor would I try to patronize you in any way. I just want you to see that there is a better way to handle life than being angry. I was wrongly convicted of a felony crime eight years ago and have harbored bitterness for a long time against the investigators. I came to the conclusion that I needed to forgive not only myself, but ( and this may be hard to grasp ) forgive those who railroaded me. I think that it might help to forgive those who attacked you. As I said, I wouldn't even try to patronize you and forgive me if I am. I'm saying there is a better way to experience healing in your life, that's all.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Who said anything about being angry? I am sorry you went through that. But did you not try to right it then? Would you not defend youself should it happen again?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I've become somewhat more anti-abortion in the past few months as a result of my own experiences. However, I am not interested in limiting women's choices. In trying to put myself in the shoes of a woman who was raped I just can't imagine what it would feel like to be pregnant as a result of the rape, not want to stay pregnant, but forced to all the same. Can you imagine walking around, everyone happily dancing around at the sight of your extended abdomen asking questions? " When is the baby due? Boy or girl? Are you excited / nervous? Midwife or hospital? Epidural or natural? Is the father nervous? " I wouldn't want to tell anyone I was raped. It's a very personal, violating act that you might not want everyone to know about. Things become awkward. People act differently. What if you are married / in a relationship? How is your spouse / partner going to feel about you carrying another's child-a daily reminder of the violence that occurred to their loved one? What a horrible, terrible experience. I know that pregnancy is not permanent, but I would not wish this on anyone. I know the fetus is innocent. So is the woman. Men suck. :)<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yeah but all of those are personal things that you don't want to happen to you. These are all WANTS. And honestly, a want doesn't come before a need and killing the child because of ones wants is selfish. If someone rapes you, they have commited a wrong against you and in many ways " killed " a part of you and of course the women feels violated... but does this justify you doing a wrong to someone innocent? Would you kill your neighbor if some stranger robbed you because you wanted to be safer by having no one near you? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>em   pa   thy : Identification with and understanding of another's situation, feelings, and motives. Look into yourself and see if this is inside. While you're in there, think about what you just said. Specifically, how women post-rape have selfish feelings about wanting to get rid of their undeserved pregnancy.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>you assume I know nothing about rape.... we'll leave it at that. This statement is still ironic though. I don't see any empathy for the child. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You're right ; since you're a man I assume you have no firsthand knowledge of being a victim of rape. I have no empathy for the " child ". Early enough, it has no thoughts, feelings, etc. I value a grown, breathing, and self-sustaining woman who has time invested in her life more than a fetus. It's like triage ; which would you save first?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I asked you to leave it alone See, I don't discriminate against any person so I can't choose one life over another. Everytime someone does discriminate history has shown them to be wrong.... slavery and jews come to mind but looking further back in history this still holds try. Your biased it purely based on stage of development and this makes it wrong. Do you believe a 1 yr old is less deserving to live then a 90 year old because the 90 yr old has more " time invested " in their life? most cases their is only one life that can be saved. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>No, you didn't. You said, " We'll leave it at that. " And as this is a rape topic, and I meant no animosity, I was only explaining that as you are a man, and from what I understand the majority of men do not understand what rape is like. Sorry if I offend. But you do discriminate against people. You have decided that your opinions on abortion should be forced onto women you've never met. And... not to be picky, but you said " person " and whether or not a fetus is a person can be debated. Not that I want to get into that! :) Yes, my bias is stage of development b / c a young fetus has no essential organs for life. [ I am not supportive of late term abortions. ]<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Discrimination would imply that I wish to hold different standards for people. I think everyone has the right to live... therefore no discrimination. Pro-choicers believe that some can live and some shouldn't based on nothing more than a random stage of development point. I guess you could say I discriminate by applying the right to life to only humans but that doesn't seem like a strong case you could make.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I don't what the law says on this in the US : anyone care to enlighten us? In the UK viability is at 24 weeks into the pregnancy. At that point " elective " abortion becomes illegal, although the law is worded in quite a loose way that allows later abortions to be performed for a variety of reasons.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>there is no US law deciding when this is. However, I fail to see the difference in someone that can live on their own ( which a new-born can't do either ) and someone that can... they are both still a " someone " and do grant a " right " to kill some innocent people and let some others live seems a bit wrong. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The point of viability is at that time the baby stands a reasonable chance of surviving birth and early development, its not an concept concerned with " someone that can live on their own " as such.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>what makes this person different from one that can't survive? They are still both people... do you suggest we discriminate against certain people? Also, at one time does the unborn reach this stage? It seems to be farther and farther back as science gets better... does this mean that what once was a 24 week old baby that couldn't be saved was not deserving of rights but now that science has gotten better the unborn 24 week old is deserving of rights? Seems inconsistent <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Trying to strike the balance between two conflicting interests is what : the need for a woman to have control over her pregnancy and the need of the state to provide legal protection to the unborn..... I'm surprised you haven't noticed that. Do you suggest we live in a world free from discrimination? Inconsistent? not at all when you consider the concept is based on currently available medical care.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I would say this is a ' want ' not a need. reasonably, in an ideal world, yes. But the time changes... first it was 36 weeks now 24 what happens when science can make the unborn live after 1 hr of conception? Does this mean the unborns granted rights have changed over the course of science evolution?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>But jimmy, aren't we debating in a thread specifically dedicated to pregnancies that result from rape? In answer to your rock climbing question : Yes. By all means pry my grip loose and send me to my death, if that is your choice. In return, I pose another question. You and I are rock climbing. I have an accident and I fall, and manage to grip your leg. You decide to let me fall. Should you be charged with murder? Your position seems to be either : By consenting to sex, you consent to be pregnant since you acknowledge that pregnancy can result from sex, even if the odds are less than one in ten thousand. Having consented to the pregnancy, the woman cannot then change her mind on the issue and take action to become not pregnant. OR : All actions that result in a loss of life ( as abortion does ) should be made illegal. This would obviously not include the state sanctioned killings we already have, but would include things like the rock climbing scenario, or giving aid to a random injured person on the street. Or is there another position I have missed?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>If you wanted the person to fall knowing they would die then yes it is murder in my book. I am going to use a similiar real case scenario here... 3 people, a boy and 2 grown men, got stranded out on a boat in the middle of Ocean ( In England ).. They were out there for some 2 weeks with no food or water. The boat was finally rescued but the boy was not on the boat. The two men said that the boy was near death so they decided to eat him so the others could survive. It was very clear the boy would have died because of his age and weight at the time. It is also clear that when out on a boat that long people become crazy. They were arrested for murder. Should they be convicted? Murder was defined at the time as " The killing of a person without authority from the government " ( or something along those lines ). I know the result and will post it after some thoughts. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>But why should the person to whose leg I am clinging be required by law to attempt to rescue me? Especially when a rescue attempt may place their own safety in jeopardy. Interesting. If eating the boy could be proven to have saved their lives, then I dont think they should be convicted. However, the story isn't really analogous to abortion. A better analogy would be : You find a stowaway on your boat. You toss him over the side, and he drowns. Should you be charged with murder?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I don't that was the question. You never said the mans lift was endangered you just said they let him fall. This would be murder... Just like if you let someone with a gun kill someone else you are responsible finding an exact match is difficult but this is a famous case taught in many law classes. The 2 men were convicted on murder but were pardoned by the Queen. The reason they were convicted was because they law clearly states what murder is and thus they had to be convicted. Eating the boy didn't save the boys life and he never gave consent to it. By saying it was ok you support MAKING someone else die for the saving of another. Some choice. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Indeed. But who is to say how lifting me might place someone else in danger? In keeping with the rock climbing example, they might have to let go with one hand, and change their position on the rock face. This might be dangerous. I wouldn't expect someone to try and rescue me if they thought it might be dangerous. And I wouldn't support a law that forced people to attempt to save others at risk to themselves. Ah, but you aren't held responsible in that case. If you and a friend are walking down the street and are accosted by an armed robber, and he threatens you both then shoots your friend, you are most certainly not responsible for your friends death. No one would expect you to attempt to fight an armed mugger. Fair enough. Interesting precedent. It's not a choice all people can live easily with. Kill or die. But it is supported by law these days ( at least in terms of self defense ) to kill someone to preserve your own life or safety, where the act of killing is deemed to be a reasonable and proportionate use of force. But we're getting way off topic with this.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I think you are getting a little out of the example. The example won't work if we talk about it as a saving measure. If I don't pick up a knife and stab my neighbor, i'm not saving his life, i'm just not killing him. Having a child is the same way in that you are not saving a life that was in danger. You aren't letting your friend be killed though. If you said " shoot my friend dead right now ", then that is murder. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I understand where you are coming from here. No arguments. The rock climbing analogy works like this : Two people climbing the rock face = The baby living inside the mother. One falls, and manages to cling to the others leg = The baby depends 100% on the mother for life. The person whose leg is being clung to decides not to let the other person hang on, and lets them fall to their death = The mother decides to not let the baby use her body, and lets the baby die. In neither instance would I support a law mandating that a person be required to provide care for someone against their will. Depending on how greatly sayng that affected the decision of the shooter to pull the trigger, then yes I suppose you could be held accountable.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Should an innocent human be put to death for the crimes of others?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Should the innocent victim of a terrible crime be forced to endure anymore suffering than is absolutely necessary? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No a foetus shouldn't.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You didn't answer the question jimmy-boy. Should the woman be forced ( because that is what you are advocating ) to bear a pregnancy that resulted from a rape? I'm not interested in those who decide to keep the child ( good luck to them ) but individuals who want the course of their life to be altered as little as possible by their ordeal. Do would you force them to carry that child? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I did in fact answer your question, now I shall answer this one. What is worse, to be forced to carry a baby due to rape or to die because your father was a rapist? Besides rape accounts for less then 0.001% of the 46 million American    s killed due to abortions. You wouldn    t even subject the rapist to death so why kill the innocent victim ; can you not see that you want to destroy the only good that has come from the incident?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>With regard to the former, horrific I guess. As to the latter die is an inappropriate word, as is killed etc. If you were to say " or to never exist because your father was a rapist? " I would have to say I expect no right to exist as a result of a rape. If the mother victim decides to bear me till I am born, I'm fortunate for that grace. You are advocating a draconian imposition on the victims of rape - to use your figures thats around 45000 women you have denied the chance to reassert control over their lives. No, but I oppose the death penalty on the basis that if a miscarriage of justice occurs there is no way to recscind the sentence, and that criminal justice has moved on from capital punishments of centuries gone by. As to your reference to " the only good " that can only be viewed from the perspective of the woman who has been raped. If she decides to see the pregancy through, that is her perogative. If however she wants to terminate the pregnancy I can see no valid reason to oppose her wishes - she has been attacked, violated : why should she have to sacrifice yet more of herself? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I don't see the point in debating with you when you fail to do basic maths.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The fact is that the foetus was put in the position by the one who wants the abortion, how many deaths to humans have to face so their mothers can enjoy sex? What the hell are you talking about? It is quite simple, a woman chooses to have sex knowing that it can cause here to be pregnant whether she uses all the contraceptives in the world, yet at the point of pregnancy she demands the right to kill another human, that is wrong, especially since pro-choice justify themselves on the grounds that they say they should have choice, the choice to be pregnant or not has always existed and always will, abstinence.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So in summary ( I want to make sure I understand ) you say, " Don't want to get pregnant? Don't have sex. " My response? " Don't like abortion, don't get one! " Let the ones who get abortions deal with the consequences. Keep your nose out of uteri's belonging to women you've never met. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Did you ask the foetus if they wanted to be aborted? No, so stay out of their business. Sorry but your very weak philosophy has just crumbled.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>( In keeping with this thread my response is thus : ) Did you ask the woman if she wanted to be raped? No? Oh. Well, I guess she should just continue to suffer and that's too bad. No one cares about her. She should've just kept her legs closed. Oh, wait, she couldn't ; she was forced. Still too bad for her ; she needs to suck up the consequences of her... oh, no, they weren't her actions. Hmm. I suppose women are just supposed to deal with it ; they are baby-making machines whose lives are secondary to that of a fetus. ( In a generalized way ( the absense of the rape scenario ) I would respond : ) You can't ask the fetus. In the absense of it having even a mind you must succumb to the decisions of those who are responsible for it. You better be a vegetarian. Otherwise you're a hypocrite, and there's no arguing that. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So you justify abortion even though out 46 000 000 abortions less then 500 are a consequence of rape, and not only that but you remedy the rape case by killing the innocent foetus? Their are 3 individuals involved here, the rapist, the woman and the foetus, do you give the rapist a death sentence? So why hand one to the son or daughter of the mother? Is there a way to keep them all alive? Yes. Can the mother give her child up for adoption if she chooses? Yes. Your theory is weak, sly and of hate and death. Mine is compassionate and just and no one dies. I eat meat, of loads of it, since I have the teeth designed for eating meat, that is natural as is child birth, natural is good, nothing hypocritical here. You make some silly comments.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The topic is rape. I don't know what the numbers are, and that's not what I'm debating. I will respect your opinions. I can see both sides, although I disagree with one of them. Killing innocents just so you can eat them is not natural. A cow, pig, horse, dog, cat, rat all have functioning hearts, brains, with emotions and feelings. Even if eating animals is in our design, it does not mean that we cannot overcome it. There are plenty of other foods to eat that will give you the nutritional resources your body needs. I'm sorry to go off topic. It is a hypocrisy, though. How can you value fetal life more so that any other? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>But they are not human, so tough, I will scoff the lot, ummmmm.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>What do animals lack or have that make them okay to dine on? What do humans have that makes us so different and special? I don't understand ; help me. ( sorry for going off topic-PM me if you like. ) <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Spirituality<br><b> S2:5-  </b>We cannot even begin to understand how other creatures think. It is egoistic and naiive to be so presumptuous. I hope you meet a creature one day that changes your mind. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Yeah, because a horse is going to start talking to me one day about the heavens and will me enlighten me on the origins of the universes, then the horse will come to my house and have tea with me after we have just attended church. Then I might meet a frog that will show me how to meditate and I will find a see a spider that can sing praises to the lord. Followed by that I will spend a few weeks at the congregation of the blessed hedgehog and he will explain passages of the bible to me in a deep voice while he dances to the rhythm of basement jaxx. I can't wait!<br><b> S2:6-  </b>And you said I say silly things! :) Spirituality doesn't necessarily equate to " religion " nor have anything to do with " the lord " and " church " et cetera. This is a very limited idea of what spirituality is. Again, it is very egoistic to assume that we have any concept of the way other creatures think. I can't assume how you think despite the fact that we are the same species. I'm not arguing that they are the same. I'm stating that we have no idea how they think, just as they have no idea how we think. Of course they are different! Just as you and I are different. I'm not salivating over your dead flesh, though. Not dead flesh.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Oh that is bad forcing pregnancy, - your forcing death on little humans, and that is worse, I'll take the lesser evil any day. That is if you can even call birth evil.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Says who? Why should the pregnant woman be required to provide support for the unborn child against her will? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Forcing pregnancy. Or Forcing death on little humans. Hmmmm, which is worse?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Forcing pregnancy. Everyone should have the right to stop caring for another person, if they want. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So society should have the right to stop caring for a pregnant woman and force her to have a child then too! I might stop caring for my neighbour, and kill them with a suction catheter, because I have the right.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>hey, if he thinks he can get away with it without getting trashed at the ballot box, then go nuts. Ah, now your making the classic pro-life mistake. It's not about killing the baby. Thats just a sucky side effect. It's about having the right to control your own body. Society should definately have the right to make a pregnant woman make her own way in the world. No one should have to care for her if they don't want to. However, there is an extremely large gap between not providing care for her, and forcing her to carry a baby to term. In fact, the two are completely unrelated. The same with your neighbour analogy. There is no correlation between your obligation ( or lack thereof ) to provide a duty of care for him, and any right you may have to kill him. A woman is pregnant. She refuses to care for the baby. The baby is removed, and since it is too young to survive, it dies. A similar analogy would be : A person comes across an injured person in the street. They refuse to give aid to the injured person. As a result, the injured person dies. It would NOT be : You come across a person in the street, and decide to kill them. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>If you and I were rock climbing and we had an accident, which resulted in you dangling off a ridge with your only lifeline being my leg, which you managed to grab in the accident, do I have the automatic right to remove you from my leg, which would send you to your death? The justification being, you are restricting my freedom to walk away. Remember, I have the right to control mine own body.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I see you * mis - understand* me AGAIN. First of all, a mother isn't obligated thats what adoption and orphanges are for. If my child has a rare kidney disorder and needs a kidney that only I can provide, I am STILL not obligated by law to give my child one of my kidneys. A born child doesn't need to bodily live off another for survival BTW. One more time NO BORN PERSON HAS THE RIGHT TO LIVE OFF THE BODILY PERSON ( ORGANS, BLOOD ) OF ANOTHER WITHOUT CONSENT. Removing a fetus from my bodily person which results in the death of the fetus is an expression of my right to my bodily person.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What if you consent at first and once the person become solely dependent on you for survival you say " no... I don't consent anymore, go away ". I don't think you can morally kill the person because you don't consent anymore. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It's still my right.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It makes a good point for the pro-life side... It isn't a moral right. It is the same as murder <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I really don't see how? Well obviously we disagree on whats moral and what isn't. I don't even see abortion as a moral issue, it's a mdical issue IMO. It's pointless to discuss the moral standing of a non-sentient non-sapient human as it is to pray and worship a non-sentient and non-sapient God. The very fact we disagree on the moral / value status of a fetus suggests that the moral / value status of a fetus is subjective. You think abortion is immoral don't have one, simply said. :)<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I really hope you don't actually attend church and believe in the Christian God... well, perhaps saying don't attend is a bad word but I mean hold those views and attend church. The Bible says nothing about a human having to be sentient or sapient to be one of God's children. To Him we are all non-sentient and non-sapient. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well thats an odd thing for another christian to say! lol! Actually I attend UCC. I am really starting to think you don't understand those terms. Man needs a mind to interact with God, this is why humans are above all other creatures because we have the capacity to know and interact with God. We have sentience and sapience.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I don't recall ever telling you I was a Christian. Nevertheless, atleast quote my entire thought as oppose to limiting it just to the first part ;) You don't need a mind... just a spirit. Your " mind " is gone when you die but you can still communicate with God. Either you believe we just don't exist when we die ( thus making God rather worthless ) or you think God just removes your brain and takes it up too. When God said " I know you before you were born " I wonder what you think He knew? I wonder if you think Jesus was not God for 5 - 9 months? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>When the bible uses the term ( soul ) or spirit in most cases the term is reffering TO the mind. God knows past / present and future all at the same time, and no I do not believe Jesus was divine.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Oh right... jewish... Well, we are working on different playing fields then ;) I disagree that soul and spirit refer to " the mind ". As I said, you mind goes away when you die.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I guess it's because some pro-lifers have been brainwashed ( as well as many pro-abortionists ) that aborting a baby conceived by rape or incest will heal, or be a help to the victim. I, myself, have come to the conclusion that abortions hurt much more than they heal. Not just phsyically ( Side effects can occure months afterward ) but psychologically as well. Guilt, depression, so forth. In my view, abortion is murder, one way or the other and rare extreme cases don't justify its legality. Even the rape victim gets a better chance than the baby does. They're at least alive while they kill their baby. That in itself will eat at the person for years until they find some way of forgiving themselves. I believe these testimonies to be real, and I feel sorry for those victims who feel obligated because of family relations ' repuations to kill their own child. It really is sad.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I guess that is your opinion, so if you ever get raped don't get an abortion. The point is, is that it is a choice and not yours. If a women ( girl ) is molested or raped and doesn't feel comfortable keeping the baby who are you to decide that for them? Personally if I were raped and became pregnant I WOULD NOT keep the fetus, if someone else thought differently and they decided to keep a rape fetus more power to them, but don't expect everbody to feel the same as you do. The best person to make that choice is the one that has been through the rape / incest and has to live with the outcome. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Do I have tell you exactly how many rape / incest victims are the ones who decide an abortion is neccessary? How many of them need to have counseling years afterwards because they had the abortion, not because they were a rape / incest victim? There are very few if any girls in the U.S. that would have an abortion after an experience like that. It's the family and relations that force them into it in order to keep the matter hush-hush. No doubt some of those reasons seem good, but abortion is an incorrect solution. The help a victim should get is a hug, some tears and comforting words so that they view their future life in a positive light. Instead, they bury them in words of " GET AN ABORTION, YOU'LL FEEL BETTER LATER ". Yeah right. Oh, I think I'll add that only 1% of abortions performed yearly are for rape / incest cases. And some years it may even drop lower than that. Should we keep abortion legal for just that 1%?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>First of all rape is one of the most under-reported crimes so it makes sense that abortion due to rape / incest is also under-reported so that makes your assumptions and numbers off. But of course you are missing the whole point. You are not the one being raped so it isn't YOUR choice. I don't need you making choices for me or telling me what is and isn't good for my emotional health. If one gets raped and DOES NOT want to be pregnant who are you tell them they have to be? Abortion should be legal for everybody who wants one not just rape / incest victims, for the simple reason that no human being has the right to substain life by using the body of another why should a fetus have more rights than actual persons? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It has equal rights. The rape / incest victim does not have to DIE, she has to live with a pregnancy, and that should not stand in the way of the baby's right to live. And you should research rape / incest abortion cases more thoroughly, you're knowledge of their frequency seems kind of small considering your post.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I am sorry I think you misunderstood me. Even IF a ftus somehow has a right to life, they STILL do not have a right to that life if it means using anothers body without consent. No person has that right. You may find abortion immoral. Thats your opinion, but to make abortion illegal is granting more rights to a fetus that any other actual person has. I have a * right to life*but that doesn't grant me the right to hook up to your blood supply if I need a 24 hour 7 day a week blood transfusion without your consent. Even if not doing so results in my death. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>What are you talking about?!? A fetus doesn't take blood from the Mother. And I would challenge you to show me a BORNchild in the world that didn't require physical assistance ( from anybody ) to survive. A born-child can't live without physical help, so I guess if a family doesn't want to support their child anymore, they can just boot them out and say they don't have the right to live off of them.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I see you * mis - understand* me AGAIN. First of all, a mother isn't obligated thats what adoption and orphanges are for. If my child has a rare kidney disorder and needs a kidney that only I can provide, I am STILL not obligated by law to give my child one of my kidneys. A born child doesn't need to bodily live off another for survival BTW. One more time NO BORN PERSON HAS THE RIGHT TO LIVE OFF THE BODILY PERSON ( ORGANS, BLOOD ) OF ANOTHER WITHOUT CONSENT. Removing a fetus from my bodily person which results in the death of the fetus is an expression of my right to my bodily person. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>You still have to prove that a living fetus has less rights than you. You also have to remember that you got the fetus through consensual sex, and that the pregnancy is something you must deal with if you really cared about your rights to your own body. A fetus is not a part of your body, and if you didn't want it, you had no business having voluntary sex. You're right to your body and its desires should not stand in the way of a fetus's right to live.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>It doesn't matter, even IF a fetus has the same rights as me it STILL doesn't have MORE rights than me. And how I got the fetus is irrelevant. I think you misunderstand the term * right-to - life* sure everybody has the right to life but not at the exspense of someone esles body. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Why's that? Are you now considering yourself more important than the fetus? Oh yes it does, happygrl 35. You can't just have sex whenever you want and have an abortion once a pregnancy comes along. You need to take responsibility and accept the fact that you can't have one without the other.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Steeeve, In Post #57, you say that the one best able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy is the woman herself. Your words were, " This is the most crucial question of the debate? Only you think this because not even many pro choicers do. In any event the answer is the woman [ who makes the choice ]. " In Post #59, you say that abortion should be criminalized. Again, your words were, " I think it [ abortion ] should be criminalized. " I don't suppose you would care to resolve the blatant contradiction, would you? Or do you really believe that an integer can be + and - simultaneously?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>How is it a contradiction? Let me ask you this rhetorically. Who is better to run your own life, the government or you? If you say " you " than is there a contradiction if you support murder laws? I don't think so and since abortion is murder I don't see that as a contradiction. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It's a contradiction since you say that the pregnant woman should have the right to choose whether or not to continue her pregnancy but you permit the government to hold the hammer of a murder charge over her head if she makes a choice that the government disapproves of. How is that NOT a contradiction? BTW, since in your mind abortion = murder, what penalty would you exact under the law and to whom should it be applied? The woman? The doctor? The person who drove the woman to the clinic ( accessory before the fact )?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, I never said that. I said she is better " to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy ". If by that you mean " right to choose to continue the pregnancy " than I would say if she chooses abortion than the government is better at determining the future of her pregnancy, otherwise the woman is. Perhaps you should be more clear in what you mean. Do you purposely ignore everytime I answer this question? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>This is gibberish. It seems that you support the right of a woman to make only the governmentally-approved choice. This is, of course, no choice whatsoever. Now, why not tell the forum just exactly WHY you think the government is " the government is better at determining the future of her pregnancy. " Why not tell the forum why you do not trust a woman's choice. Why not tell us why you are so sure that the government to which today you would give the power to criminalize abortion may not at some time in the future be the same government which will require it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>in the choice between killing the baby and not? Yes. exactly. I never said that. I said the government is better at determining you shouldn't kill your baby if you want to do that. I make it a habit not to trust people who want to kill others. I suppose they could but I would vote against them.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What about those of us who could give a less about the religious aspects,... but who see that elective abortion and the legality of it violates the spirit ( if not the founders original intent ) of the 5th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution? What about us?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You can believe that nonsense if you wish, but unless and until you become amember of the SCOTUS, you will jusat have to accept the law as written and as intrpreted by the Court. BTW, in actuality, the Court made the correct decision. Roe v. Wade is a model of judicial restraint. Mr. Justice Blackmun states quite clearly that, in light of the multiple theories about when life begins, that the Court is not going to enshrine one above all the others. Instead, as he said, the choice was to be left to each individual woman. BTW, you just tipped your hand. You truly DO believe that the government is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is. It is a absurd concept, but at least you were forthright enough to tell the forum that you support absurdity. Few before you have had the stones to do so. :( <br><b>S1:2-  </b>1. Appeal to ridicule and probably a forum rules violation. 2. I have a 1st. Amendment right to speak, assemble and to petition the Government for redress... in any case where I disagree with a law. The laws regarding abortion included. 3. Opinion noted. 4. See #3 5. Blackmuns comments? 1973. Human genome project began 1990. QUOTE ; " The ethical, legal and social issues raised by the project are numerous and diverse in nature... " In 1965, Dr. Leonard Hayflick discovered the biological mechanics for how a person's aging biologically begins at conception,... but the implications for that finding are only now being applied to the abortion issue. His findings ( that life biologically begins at conception ) were not presented in Roe v. Wade. Someday, a new SCOTUS will get the right case to consider new findings again. 6. Gross Mischaracterization and should be reported as such 7. See #6<br><b> S2:2-  </b>OK, if these are such gross mischaracterizations, then the only possible logical conclusion is that you support the right of a woman to choose the future of her pregnancy. That makes you handle here only one of many choices, even if it is the one you prefer. Sorry, but you can't have it both ways. There are two and only two alternatives ; either the woman has the autonomy to choose the future of her pregnancy, or the nanny state takes that choice from her. Which more accurately sums up your POV? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>This line of questioning is not only known as a " Red Herring " argument. It is also antithetical to the issue of " when does a child's right to their life begin? " A woman's rights do not take place in a vaccuum. Neither do a child's rights, by the way. Nobody's rights rights are as exclusive as you demand in your question.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So then, how a bout a final, definitive statement on your part as a aresponse to the question. For me, the answer is legally, morally, and ethically clear. The rights of an actual person in being, i.e., the pregnant woman, trump the rights of a potential person, i.e., the fetus, every single time. If only any of you profetallifers would be so forthright. Please do not hide behind the smokescreen of attacking my POV ; tell us yours. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>And when you recognize the fact that a human fetus is an actual " person " in the fetal stage of their life,... Your position will likely change accordingly.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Non-responsive, though I knew you would attack my POV instead of providing your answer. Where is your opinion as to who is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy, the woman herself or the nanny state? Why do all you profetallifers run away and hide from that simple question?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Why don't people quote thescriptures correctly instead of making it up as they go? What the Bible says about Abortion < list snipped to save bandwidth > If you find conflicting ideas in the bible, which do you believe and why? Tough to have it both ways AND the bible doesn't pretend to have it both ways. The bible holds the termination of pregnancy as stated above.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I'm curious DRD,... do you support the " Separation of Church and State? " <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Awe, take a guess.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I'm guessing no. You are not for the " separation of church and state " else, you wouldn't be bringing religion into an otherwise secularly achievable political argument. Am I correct? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not exactly. The faaaarrrr right Christians have brought abortion into the separation of church and state. Besides, to this thread this is not the subject under consideration.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Next question,... so, if you are actually for the Separation of Church and State and seemingly offended by the far rights bringing of abortion into the debate,... why are you envoking religion in your defense of abortion again?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>So you have no personal moral objection to it you just choose not to do it. I guess it would be something like having no real problem with eating cake you just never real want to. Ha, that's the best I could come up with :) Some people judge but that has nothing to do with abortion being right or wrong. Seems there is always a disconnect in the arguments of abortion. No one objects to a person choosing what is right for themselves. No one objects to the idea that murdering a person is wrong. The disconnect is that pro-life people feel the unborn is a person and therefore should choose for themselves and thus abortion would be the same thing as if you killed me. So pro-life folks never see it as a one-party problem but as a two-party problem.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Wrong. I do have a personal moral objection to abortion. I just don't attempt to foist my personal morals on others. What they do is their business. Next time an " unborn person " makes a choice... you give me a call. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Sorry, I thought that is what you meant. What is the moral objection? Do you feel it is killing someone?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well, killing an embryo or a fetus, I wouldn't call it killing a " someone ". We feel that if we produce a life, it is our responsibility to take care of it. Balance that with the fact that we would have no problem with having an abortion in the event of pregnancy resulting from rape or grave danger to her health. So am I personally opposed to killing an embryo or fetus simply as a matter of birth control... yes. Am I opposed to others making the choice for themselves... not at all. I have a choice, and I choose no. But I am very glad I have the choice. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I guess I just don't understand why you place value on an embryo or fetus but this is clearly less value than a born person. Do I understand that correctly?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I'm not sure if you do or not. I'm not sure why you think I value a fetus more or less than a " born person ". Can you explain what you mean by that? Basically, my wife and I will not participate in an elective abortion, we simply could not bring ourselves to kill the fetus that will eventually become our child. Aside from that, I could give two hoots about what anyone else wants to do. I view it as a personal decision, and everyone should have the right to decide what is best for themselves, not have their actions dictated to them by others with different beliefs. Remember, pro-choice only means having that option... it does not mean pro-abortion. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Sorry, I'm honestly just trying to understand your position I have no heard it before and perhaps I'm assuming a few things. I'm saying do you value a born person more than an unborn in terms of what rights they are afforded. I'd assume you think I have the same right to life as some homeless guy on the corner... correct? If this is the case than I'd assume the unborn has less rights because you don't support any law to protect the unborn from being killed but you would for me and the homeless guy equally. To me that comes across as different value levels. But you do give two hoots about other people you don't know getting murdered, yes? This too is a personal decision of another ( in many cases ).<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I guess it comes down to the fact that while I see both the fetus and the person synonymous with life, I do not see the fetus synonymous with the person. I don't really look at it as " unborn person " and " born person ". There are people, and there are fetuses. I myself would always choose to allow that fetus to become a person, but some would choose not to. I support other peoples rights to make their own decisions. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Ok, so it is a different value. This is similar to what pets are to people ( not the exact same I understand )... you don't want to see them killed and would protect that but if it came between the person and the pet the person's rights win. This is slightly different because you actually don't have a choice to slaughter your pets... as Michael Vick found out<br><b> S2:5-  </b>No, Vick found out that people don't seem to like it when you take dogs and make them fight to the death for sport. You can however have your pet euthanized in a humane and painless way at almost any vets office. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I was making a joke :)<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I don't think I agree. I support your right to consume porn even if I don't care to. I support your right to choose. My point was simply I would be more likely to believe you a " saver of unwanted babies " if you were actively saving one not just proposing that they should be " saved ".<br><b> S2:1-  </b>MY GOD, PLEASE tell me that you hold politicians to this same criteria then!!! I know this is a little off the topic, but it needs to be said... we have Liberal politicians and activists who claim to care for the poor and starving, push for policies to " help " these people, but do little or NOTHING to change the problem themselves, i.e., taking the poor in, giving enough money DIRECTLY from their own pocket to feed a starving family. We Conservatives are considered EVIL because we DON'T push the policies, but rather prefer doing things on our own to help. I expect to get a few laughs from your side on that one, but seems to me if the shoe fits.... Do you consider the Democrats / Liberals saviors of the poor? Seeing my point, no doubt you will say no, but then that wouldn't be consistent with a Liberal way of thinking <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I trust that there are both Conservatives and Liberals giving directly to the " poor ". I don't know how consistently liberal I am but I do not consider Conservatives " evil ". If private donation can be said to have not solved the " problem " since it persists, I don't see any other solution than to have some level of governmental intervention. The fact that no perfect solution has been found does not suggest that all support should be abandoned. I do not subscribe to the conservative notion that everyone can " lift themselves by their bootstraps " given there are many without boots.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well up until he was running for President, Kerry didn't seem to care much at all about charities. But anyway..... Well, considering that trillions have been spent " helping " the poor, I would say that that can be labeled as a HUGE failure. And no doubt not all Conservatives take people into their home, but then again, we don't make that a cornerstone of our beliefs, and Liberals do. And I beg to differ, we all have bootstraps, we just have different levels of motivation <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Do you believe lack of motivation explains why we have the poor?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It's certainly a factor. There have been poor that have made it big, have there not? Are you going to say that they made it on luck alone? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Do you believe that since some poor have " made it big " that it can be inferred that anyone can?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I think everybody has within them an ability to become successful to the point of not being a drain on society <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I agree but that wasn't the question. Conservatives are big on the " rags to riches " mythology and you are talking " rags to thrift store ". IMO veiled contempt for the less fortunate is a cornerstone of conservative idealogy and the reason I cannot be one. It strikes me as a form of " manifest destiny ". If the strong don't seek to protect and uplift the weak then what sort of people are they? I do not share values with these people.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>We've debated that already, though. You believe the way you believe, and I believe the way I believe. Unless something new is brought to the table, we know where each other stands. Actually, the only opinion I've given you is that I don't believe choosing for hair color. There are many instances I don't believe abortions should be performed, especially cosmetic reasons. Whatever reasons I believe aren't good ones for abortions are just my opinion and have no bearing on whether I believe abortion should be legal. I don't " support " abortion. I am against making it illegal, but I have no love for abortion. I believe it's a necessary choice. Ok. Not my favorite way to debate but I guess I'll give it a go.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Well, that wasn't clear from your posts. I just don't understand though, you believe in a woman's choice, for whatever reasons she feels are important to her, but yet you think it would be wrong for cosmetic reasons? Gender reasons too? Sorry, seems " inconsistent " to say the least <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It would only be inconsistant is I had abortions for those reasons. Others do things I don't approve of all the time. If I don't approve of you owning a gun but I believe in your right to, am I inconsistent? Believing in the right and approving of the action are two different things.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So you are saying if a woman chose to abort her pregnancy based on cosmetic or gender reason, you would support her right to do that? And to further clarify, away from the RIGHTS aspect, you seem to believe it's okay to abort for financial reasons but not for cosmetic / gender reasons? THAT to me is where the inconsistency lies. Forget about the rights part for a second, basing it on your BELIEFS <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I support the right to abort for any reason. My personal reasons would not include cosmetic reasons. If I or my SO were pregnant, we would have to be in dire financial straits to consider abortion. Cosmetics don't necessarily negativly affect us, while a financial burden would. If our circumstances were such that we flatly could not afford an extra expense, then we would consider abortion. It would not be a light decision. Obviously if either of our lives were threatened, or our health seriously impaired we would consider it then as well.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Despite our differences, I don't consider you stupid ( the ARGUMENTS you have are a different story :-P ), so I would have been shocked if you had said differently.... on HERE anyway ;-) There's no truth detector here to say with any certainty that you in FACT think this way, you are smart enough to know that IF you had said differently it would've damaged your argument, so ANYWAY.... We all know how iffy one's financial situation is at any given time. While you are pregnant, things could be a little tight, and the day after you have an abortion you could get a big promotion. Or could be the other way around, you're pregnant and things are going great and boom, the child is born and you lose your job... what then? You really can't see what a weak argument you have, to base that kind of decision on circumstances that can change at the drop of a hat. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I'm not sure what you mean by this It isn't an argument, it's my personal beliefs. If I or my SO got pregnant and decided that we could not afford it, we would consider an abortion. If we decided to keep it and after it was born lost our jobs... we would not and could not change our decision. We had decided we wanted a baby. After it is born we would not want to change our decision, nor could we.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>you said this : and I just meant that IF you had responded differently, it would make the defense of your beliefs more difficult because it would not have been a consistent belief See how legalistic this society has become? You know what I mean, substitute argument for beliefs then if it makes it easier, good Lord. And you couldn't change your decision if you killed the fetus and then hit the lottery the next day either! IF it's such an earth shattering decision like you claim, and since finanial conditions can change for the better or worse at any time, it would make much more sense to be prudent and assume that one's finances DO get better ( afterall, I'm sure many of us are making more money now than we did at 22 or 29 or...) and therefore one would keep the child. But it seems that those who believe like you can't see past their noses and make a decision based on THIS day.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>OK then. Let's see what you make of the 1791 words of 1A which say " NO LAW ". Are you ready to advocate for the dissemination of kiddie porn, or have the words " NO LAW " changed meaning over time so that they no longer mean not a single, solitary law? BTW, I can think of others who believed in absolutes - Mao, Louis XVI, Bismarck, Stalin, Hitler, Pinochet, Jaruzelski, and Kim Jong-Il. On balance, I think they more than cancel out your list. Be that as it may, there simply is no getting around the fact that profetallifers wish to keep pregnant women in slavery to their fetuses and that they are willing to sacrifice women on the altar of their fetuses.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Aside from the fact that the 1st Amendment applies only to Congress, " the freedom of speech " has never been an absolute. Treason, for instance. In what way? Are you suggesting that those folks did bad things? Such a statement has no meaning if there is no absolute truth. Do you really believe that what Hitler did was just as moral as what Wilberforce did? Do you really believe that exterminating 6 million Jews is just as moral as liberating an entire race from the institution of slavery? There it is again -- slavery to their fetuses. It has already been demonstrated that this is impossible. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Please don't show the entire forum your lack of knowledge of the Constitution by writing drivel such as this. Treason is the only crime defined in the Constitution, in Article 3 to be precise. If you took the time to read it, you would see that it dealt with ACTS, not speech. Besides which, why not tell us just exactly how, in light of the words NO LAW in the First Amendment, speech can be, under your absurd idea that the words of the Constitution, restricted, except by others interpreting those words. Kinda knocks your pet theory into a cocked hat, I would say. You want the words to be unchanging when they support your warped POV, but flexible when they do not. NICE!! Further, the dissemination of kiddie porn IS a Federal crime, so it would seem that all prosecutions by the Federal government must cease forthwith.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, it really doesn't. But what I would really like to know is this : Do you really believe that what Hitler did was just as moral as what Wilberforce did? Do you really believe that exterminating 6 million Jews is just as moral as liberating an entire race from the institution of slavery? i <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Do YOU really believe that to be an intelligent question? BTW, you might want to ask the Ukrainians about why they allied with Hitler. ( Hint : it wasn't because of his Final Solution! ) At any rate, we note that you have once again tried to shift away from a topic you don't want to discuss - your slippery Constitutional interpretation wherein you claim the right to determine which words are to be used as when they were written and which others you choose to modify over time. How about NO LAW in 1A. What new spin will you put on them to deny the right of someone to disseminate kiddie porn? Denying a pregnant woman who wants one of the RIGHT to an abortion in making her a slave to her fetus.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I see you evaded again. The question is plenty intelligent, and is really quite easy, and you are the one who brought up absolutes. So here it is again : Do you really believe that what Hitler did was just as moral as what Wilberforce did? Do you really believe that exterminating 6 million Jews is just as moral as liberating an entire race from the institution of slavery? Using force, locking them up, and other various things provided by law. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You would do this to those whom you label PROSPECTIVE lawbreakers, i.e., those who have not committed a criminal act? Welcome to Burma, North Korea, and Sudan, among others. We would love to know what the " various other things " might be. Well, there goes the original interpretation of 4A, 5A, 6A, and 8A. Not really an originalist are you, except when it suits your purposes? It's fun watching your dearly held theories slowly unravel under scrutiny. Now, what about kiddie porn under 1A? You know, the part that says NO LAW!<br><b> S2:4-  </b>In the United States, solicitation for murder will land one in prison. We punish law breakers, and that is what I am suggesting. Now, maybe you would be willing to speak to this question : Do you really believe that what Hitler did was just as moral as what Wilberforce did? Do you really believe that exterminating 6 million Jews is just as moral as liberating an entire race from the institution of slavery? Yeah, not so much. I have only made the common sense statement that we lock people up against their will all the time for things. If you support locking people up for their crimes, then you, too, support forcing at least some people to do things against their will. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Silly you. Solicitation IS a crime. In the law, solicitation, conspiracy, and attempt are called PRELIMINARY, not PROSPECTIVE criminal acts. You specifically said PROSPECTIVE criminal act. It's only the difference between night and day. For a person who says words in the Constitution have an absolute definition that is fixed for all time, you're quite sloppy in your definitions. Now, want to explain how the words NO LAW in 1a are an absolute bar to prosecutions for disseminating kiddie porn. Under your " originalist " interpretation, not only would it not be a PROSPECTIVE crime, it would not be criminal at all. If you want to " change the law ", you first need to understand it.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Not to mention that if it goes wrong, could hurt the child or teenager too.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Daewoo, The girl estimated she was four months pregnant No, the rationale is that no-one, not even parents, can force anyone to continue to be pregnant against their will. Parental guidance is encouraged, but in no way should they make the decision about what a girl, even their daughter, must do with her pregnancy. They can't force her to abort a pregnancy ( which is a logical step for " you need permission from parents " ) and they cannot force her to continue the pregnancy either. Jyoshu, As could the pregnancy. In fact, young girls are more at risk. If harm is inevitable, which should it be? A situation the girl chose to be in harming her, or a situation she was forced into harming her? Additionally, abortion is safer than childbirth. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Why shouldn't they be able to? Even if one concedes that adults have certain rights on their own, surely you can concede that minors don't, even with their own bodies. For instance, if a minor has gotten obese, don't you think a parent is within their rights to only fix meals that are healthy and prevent the minor from eating junk food? Parents do things like this all the time when it is necessary. It is generally understood in our society that a parent knows better than the child on most matters. Besides, regardless of all that, children don't have the same rights adults do period. They can't vote, they can't drive, they can't buy alcohol, etc. Why should abortion w / out parental consent be any different?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You know what's funny? The same argument you and daewoo use can be used for abortion. The fetus would qualify as a " minor " if you had your way and it was " person " under the law, would it not? The mother decides for her own body, and she decides for the fetus since she gets to decide what the fetus does with its body. The next-of-kin argument applies as well since the fetus has not achieved conciousness ( in the majority of abortions ). There is no rationale where the fetus has any right to be attached to the woman when she does not want it to be. And they don't have the right to live attached to someone else without their parent's consent :p Perfect! <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You are taking the ' right to life, ' and putting on par with the right to drive, right to marriage, etc. I believe that the very right live is the first right a person should have and is not contingent on age. Other rights are. Like it or not, children have less rights than adults. So, are you going to try and deal with the argument presented or just bring up irrelevant comparisons? You haven't answered the question presented : since minors have to get parental consent for most any medical treatement, why do you think abortion should be different?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I apologize, I thought it was addressed. It is not irrelevant, however. You believe that the right to live is superior to other rights. You are wrong. Your right to live is not superior to my right to privacy, to my right to bodily integrity. You have no right to live attached to me. You believe that parents should be able to determine whether or not their daughter is attached to a fetus, yet you do not believe a parent should be able to determine if their " child " ( the fetus ) is attached to the parent herself? Similarly to STD treatment, which can be received without parental consent, decisions that affect sexual health are a lot more personal then anything you mentioned. A right to privacy in this manner is not contingent on age either. If children have fewer rights than adults because they have fewer life experiences, a fetus has even fewer rights because it has no life experiences. What is your rationale for giving a fetus more rights than an adult woman?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You may be impervious to logic, but you do love to twist it. Of course a consequence can be chosen. It appears that even elementary logic is beyond your grasp. Either that, or you toy with it because you have a weak argument. No, you don't. Pregnancy is not always chosen but is often a consequence of having unprotected sex. Again, you twist things to suit you. People who choose to have unprotected sex should be aware of one of the possible consequences... pregnancy. Those who want not to become pregnant should not have unprotected sex or should use the rhythm method ( which is a form of protected sex ). Again, you ineptness shows. Many people choose to become pregnant. They purposely have unprotected sex in their attempts to become pregnant. Apparently, you are completely full of yourself. Abortion ( termination of a pregnancy by death and extraction of the fetus ) is a consequence of the actions of the abortionist... more simply put, abortion is murder. Since are obviously unreceptive to truth and real logic, I will let you continue your idiotic argument without my interference.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And? They are. And? lol oh dear - withdrawal counts as safe sex in your book. MAJOR problem here I'm afraid Jim - you've yet to prove that a zef is a person and that refusing to donate your bodily resources to another is murder. Oh and FYI, doctors who carry out abortions are not called abortionists by anyone but the Anti abortion Propoganda Industry. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Apparently you and Sigma are made for each other... neither of you uses logic. I said nothing of withdrawal ( That's painful! )... and we're not talking safe sex as in, let's-not-get-sick sex... we're talking protected sex as in, let's-not-get-pregnant sex. The rhythm method involves having sex only when you believe ovulation is not occuring. Duh! No wonder you got knocked up. Why are you afraid of the term " abortionist "? A pianist plays the piano. A flutist plays the flute. A guitarist plays the guitar. An abortionist produces abortions. A contortionist gets all twisted up... as in abortionist's logic. Abortion is homicide. It's only guilt that drives people to think otherwise.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I'm sorry, the rythym method is classified as withdrawal in UK street slang so I misunderstood you. Also FYI NFP only works well if you are fully trained on how to do it. it's Hardly the most reliable of methods. I'm not afraid of it, I just get sick of pro-life lies bandied about as truth. a physician procures abortions. And as midwifes are trained to carry them out as well, I presume you'll be screaming " muuuurrrderrring abortionist! " at them next time you see them deliver. Ahh, the old anti-choice " because I said so " rationale. 1 ) Prove that a fetus is a person 2 ) prove that refusing to donate your bodily resources is murder. Should be easy if the only reason to think otherwise is guilt. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>UK? That explains it all to me now. :) It doesn't take a physician to make an abortion happen. All it takes is an abortionist and an abortive procedure. It can be self-induced in which case the pregnant female is the abortionist. It can be chemically induced, in which case the abortionist is whoever provided the chemical. It can be physically induced, in which case whoever inserts or operates the killing device is the abortionist. In the case at hand, the bat-wielding XXXXX now facing felony charges is the abortionist. Life begins at conception. This is not to say that the fetus is a person on day one. Obviously, there is a transitional period between being a dividing cell mass and a conscious person. Obviously, it takes time for the nervous system to develop and provide a vehicle for feeling physical pain. However, this does not preclude the beginning of life happening at conception. If not at conception, when does life begin?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Really. So the pharmicist who sold the vitamin c is the abortionist? Interesting. And the woman who asked him to do it is innocent? I don't understand your thinking. Prove it. Although that would be pointless because you have to rpove personhood. Conciousness doesn't happen until late on in the pregnancy ( usually third trimester ) Between 24 - 28 weeks. Many moons ago in the old swamp...<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Thanks for reminding me exactly why I don't visit this forum often. Not only are you impervious to logic, a lot of teachings have rolled off your back like rain does on a duck. I'm pro-choice, too. Within your right to have sex as you please, you have the choice of having unprotected sex and living with all of the consequences or the other choice of having protected sex and living with all the consequences. Either way, you have no right to violate the rights others, including the unborn ones that you " accidently " procreate.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Hey, no problem :) Like bullets off Superman Teachings? There is no law stating that you must " deal with " all consequences of an action if you can change them. Where in the world did you get that idea? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Here again is evidence of your misunderstanding of " consequences ".<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Oh? Where is my misunderstanding when I state that one does not have to endure all consequences of an action if one can change it? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>One usually has to endure the consequences of one's actions. One also has to endure the consequences of someone else's actions directed at them. Walking barefoot in the snow will likely give you pneumonia. Bumpin ' uglies without BC will likely make someone pregnant. Both of these are consequences that you have to deal with. How you deal with each depends of the available tools and your own behavior. Whether you choose to kill the fetus or give it a decent birth, you are dealing with the consequence of pregnancy. You didn't change the consequence of unprotected sex. You simply chose to kill. It's just pathetic that so many people equate pregnancy with catching a cold or something.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Oh, I agree. That was my point. You do not have to endure the consequences if you can change them. You do not have to endure pregnancy because you can choose abortion. Abortion is also a consequence. Saying " You have to deal with the consequences of your action, so abortion is not allowed " is what what I was arguing against. It's pathetic that so many people want to use pregnancy as a punishment for irresponsible behavior. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Herein lies more evidence of inadequacy. Abortion is not a consequence. Abortion is your solution to the consequence of getting pregnant from unprotected sex. It's your way of dealing with a consequence.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Now you're just quibbling. Abortion is a consequence. Abortion is a possible consequence of sex, it is a consequence of choosing to have an abortion, it is a consequence of telling your parents and having them force you into having one. Pregnancy is a possible consequence of sex, it is a consequence of choosing to have a boyfriend, it is a consequence of impaired judgement due to alcohol or pot. Abortion is a possible conseqence of pregnancy as well. It is very disingenuous to put about that it isn't a consequence. You could say it is a consequence of a consequence as well, but that does not negate that it is a consequence of the original action.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I don't have to " stop anything ". You base your decisions on probable circumstances and I base mine on a God I trust that can provide for me in any circumstance. That is why I believe it is wrong to abort. You gave up on your child... and you didn't trust God... much less believe in Him. So you now have to deal with those consequences. I know it sounds harsh but the truth of the matter is harsh. We're dealing with life and death here. Did they tell you that you'd lose your job? Isn't it possible that you could find another job? Yeah... I think welfare prevents your child from going hungry... so that excuse is not valid. Health reasons... maybe valid, not sure since I don't know any details about such.. and since they account for the minority of abortions... they really aren't at the head of what this discussion is all about anyways. - theo<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You are entitled to your belief that abortion is wrong, and truth be told you don't have to defend it or explain it to anyone. The problem comes when someone wants to impose their belief on others who do not share it when it come to who controls whose body. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The problem with what you are saying here, Howard is that I'm not imposing anything more than you or anyone else in this discussion. I state where I stand and what is true and what is not and I'll work to defend that to support why my view on abortion should be regarded as either correct or more correct. I think it is no less than what anyone else is doing here. - theo<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, the difference is that you want to force a woman to carry the child for 9 months, go through labor and the birthing process whether she wants to or not. That is really no sweat off your back. I, on the other hand, believe that God entrusted the female of the species with the ovum and I in turn trust God and therefore trust the female as well    much more so than a government. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The government is supposed to protect innocent life not legislate death to children. Sorry, you are wrong again, Howard. - theo<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are the one calling for legislation. I am saying that God entrusted the ovum to the female and the government has no place interfering with that. You must act according to your conscience -- as must I and everyone else. That is why God gave us a free will. He gave the female of the species a free will and entrusted her with the ovum. I do not claim to know the mind of God. I do not know why he did this ; I only know that he did. The ovum is part of the female anatomy, not separate from it. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You know what, Howard. Alot of states have a seatbelt law. Why does the government care if I wear a seatbelt or not in my own car? Same logic you are purporting to me. The same with the Helmet law for motorcyclists. It is the motorcyclists head, not the government's! Why, Howard? Because the law was created to protect life!!! Wake up man! - theo<br><b> S2:4-  </b>A seatbelt law does not infringe on the inner workings of someone    s body    referred to by some as a temple. I know you are getting frustrated, but we are talking about a law that would interfere with the God    s creation and His creation of the ovum as part of the female anatomy. Why? We don    t know. To interfere with that is blasphemous. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>My point exactly, Howard!! So stop advocating it is a woman's right to interfere in the life of the child God gave her! - theo<br><b> S2:5-  </b>We can agree if you stop advocating it is a goverment's rights right to interfere in divine endowment that God gave women! <br><b>S1:6-  </b>We can agree if you stop advocating that God gave woman this right to murder her child. - theo<br><b> S2:6-  </b>So we can say that neither of us knows God    s will, but that we agree that God did not exempt women from the commandment    Thou shalt not kill    and did not give her the right to murder a child. We also agree that he made a divine pact with the female of the species, giving her dominion over the ovum and further, we agree that no government has the authority to interfere with that divine compact by forcing a woman into a nine month gestation period and subjecting her to a mandatory labor and birthing process, or in any way infringe on woman    s God given free will with regard to her reproductive system. What do you think? <br><b>S1:7-  </b>I think the government has the right to protect the gestation of the child etc... so on as you wrote. Just the same as its laws against murder are to protect and punish murderers. For some reason you see a woman having to bear her child as some kind of punishment if she doesn't want to. Well... her wants and a child's life are very different things. So we only partially agree with each other. - theo<br><b> S2:7-  </b>And your will and God's will are very different things as well, don't forget. My position is that the government has no authority over the male testicles and sperm and no authority over the female ovaries and ovum. Does the government have authority over neither, both, or just one in you opinion? <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Only when it involves a human life, again as I tire of this... abortion is murder. I think I've made that much clear. - theo<br><b> S2:8-  </b>You have stated your position, but just because we state a position doesn    t make it true. Just like you know that it is difficult for you to see things differently and change your mind ; it is difficult for others as well. Your position is that the fertilized ovum is a human being. Another position is that it is not. A third position is that it may or may not be, but that doesn    t matter because it is inside the woman and she has the say. In addition, and this is where the issue is, it is not enough to live by your position yourself, and to encourage and teach and enlighten people about how you see it, you want to have the government impose your position on others who do not see the fertilized ovum as a human being. Most people would say that you should live your life as you see fit, but don    t impose your beliefs onto my countries laws. That is the crux of it. All the best.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>There is another thing you failed to consider. That little child that is growing and developing has an eternal soul.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That eternal soul will return to God. God knows that soul was to be aborted, He chose it for that reason, a reason of His own. Every action has a purpose, that abortion had a purpose in the woman's life. Perhaps it will lead her to God later in life or the shock will lead to a more virtuous life, I don't know. Only God knows the purpose that abortion will serve. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The problem is that abortion is contrary to the will of God. You don't think for one minute that God won't hold the abortionindustry culpable for the spilling of innocent blood? You bet he will.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Nothing is contrary to the will of God. Everything that happens is known to Him and is according to His plan, the abortion industry included. It has a purpose, even if we do not see it now. Perhaps it is to lead those to God that would not otherwise see any evil in the world ( even perhaps yourself ). Those who cannot be in God's presence will not be in God's presence. Another poster said something that struck me. I hope he doesn't mind me using it ( I asked but he hasn't replied ) : ----- Originally Posted by epaphras _ faith God had to allow for the possibility of evil ( free will ) or Love could not exist. If we do not choose freely then it is neither love nor hate, it is neither good nor evil it is OBLIGATION. Good and evil, love and hate require the possibility of either. ----- I believe that requiring pregnancies to continue against the will of the woman interferes with her relationship with God. We can suggest, expect and encourage, but never command. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Wrong, wrong, wrong. God's word strictly commands : " you shall not commit murder. " And abortion is just that! Murder!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>" Thou shalt not kill "<br><b>S1:1-  </b>How about conscience? I think IT is what determines a person, not independent breathing. Because you can be on artificial lungs machine, then what, do you become a property of the machine or a hospital? Consciesness is what makes person a person. And a baby has it before it's born. Thus it is an independent person.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Problem is, the only reasonable test for consciousness is the Turing test. Which basically is run like this : Have a discussion with the subject. If you believe the subject is conscious, then they are conscious. Many people would fail the turing test due to brain disabilties or injuries, or through other medical conditions. Can't have a conversation with a person in a coma, can we? Also, almost all children and babies would fail the turing test. Responding the stimuli isn't a sign of being conscious. Single celled organisms respond to stimuli. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I thought of consciousness more of being self aware.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Indeed. Which is what the Turing test measures. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>but if a person can't speak for himself, then what, he's got not conscience? Like if he didn't learn to speak, or if he's just mute?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Sorry, my bad. When I described the Turing test, I over-simplified. In reality, you just communicate with the subject through whatever means suits both participants. This is the only way to really measure consciousness, and while it isn't perfect ( for the reasons you mentioned above ) it is the best we have. If someone or something is completely unable to communicate, then as much as we might think it is self aware and conscious, we cannot be sure. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So basically if you can get whatever form of reaction from the subject, you assume it has counscience?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Not exactly. I mean, I can get a reaction from a plant by giving it the right stimuli. That doesn't mean it is aware. The test is really simple. You communicate with the subject and if, at the end of this communication you believe the subject is self aware and conscious, then it is. There really aren't any other things to measure which will indicate consciousness. For example, you know I'm conscious ( and vice versa ) because of this back-and-forth conversation we are having. However, after a brief conversation with an automated ICQ messenger, we would both be able to tell we were talking to a simple computer program. Even though it would respond to our queries and comments, it's responses wouldn't indicate that it was self-aware and conscious. Not really related to the abortion issue, but interesting none the less. I find it extremely interesting in the field of computer programming and artificial intelligence.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>So who's safe to say that " so and so " is the limit after which doing abortion is morally wrong? You probably personally don't think that killing a 8 months embryo is good because it's still a property of his / her mother as long as it's in the womb?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What do you mean? I don't understand your first sentence. Abortion is not morally wrong. The only morally wrong would be to force the woman to carry a baby against her will. Killing an 8 month fetus ( I think it's a fetus at this stage, not an embryo ) is not morally wrong, because it is still growing inside her. Her property? Only so much as her kidney is her property. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>so how come killing a life is less morally wrong then making a woman carry it till she gives birth??? Where do your standards come from? You choose one above another on what basis? I don't see consistency in your reasoning. Because this IS my question - WHO's in the position to say that doing abortion is better then making a woman carry the baby? Where's the standard?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It    s common sense. A person    s body is his or her own. Making someone go through surgery is morally wrong, making someone donate an organ is morally wrong, making someone go through a pregnancy is morally wrong. No one has the moral authority to require this. It is tantamount to slavery. Killing my slaver would not be morally wrong when he enslaves me, for example. I would be morally in the right. Babies are a gift of God. It is destroying it as a gift if you REQUIRE someone to continue a pregnancy against their will. If it is required, it is an obligation. An obligation destroys the concept of generosity and self-sacrifice. A woman must be willing to continue the pregnancy for the baby to be truly a gift. Otherwise it is merely an obligation, a perversion of the way things should be. What consistency is there in your reasoning? How do you choose the baby over the mother? What gives you the authority to say    the baby is more important than the mother   ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>But baby is not an organ, it's temporary attached to the woman's body and that is it. I am not talking about specific medical reasons.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>While it is attached, it is using the woman's body to grow. The woman provides all sustinance, eliminates waste, provides warmth, etc. The woman is the body, in essence. And that body is her own body. She owns it, she controls who uses it. She is the only one with the moral right to do so. I ask again : What consistency is there in your reasoning? How do you choose the baby over the mother? What gives you the authority to say    the baby is more important than the mother   ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>but still, ask any doctor if foetus is an organ or not. It's still not an organ. If I get a blood transfusion from you, will that mean that I am a part of your body?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I didn't say that the unborn is an organ, I say you cannot be forced to share your body in pregnancy any more than you can be forced to donate an organ. I apologize for the confusion. Could you force me to donate blood to you? Do you have the moral authority to do that? Do you have the moral authority to force me to donate blood to someone else? To the baby inside me? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>But if it's not an organ, then it simply temporarily inhabits the body. When you say " can't be forced to share your body ".... but we are both saying that it's not a body part, so what are we talking about?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Am I to understand you do not believe the baby in the womb uses the woman's body to live? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I didn't say that. Read your own words. Baby uses the woman's body. But it's not the woman's body. Not one of the organs of the body. Woman is not born with an embryo inside of her.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>In some ways it is, since the baby is of her flesh, using the nutrients of her body to grow itself. In some ways it is not as well. However, it is undeniable that it is using her body and that it is inside her body. While it is, she has a moral right to stop if it is against her will. It continues to use her body only as long as she is willing to let it. We can hope she continues, but we cannot command her to. So when I say " She can't be forced to share her body " that's exactly what I mean. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>So how come a fact of birth so radically changes the situation? Baby becomes a person with all the rights all of a sudden? I think when you reason you forget that even though connected and dependent on the mother, baby is a separate life and a human organism, and aborting it means killing it. You only consider the woman's choice and how no one can take it away, but you forget about the brutal act of murdering another person.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>So what about people who have abortions and already have a child or children?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Then they are getting out of the responsablitiy of taking of another child. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Well, I was keeping the responsibility I took on with my daughter, and if I had another child I would be living in poverty with her, and that's not something I was prepared to do.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So you are saying that you would not have another child right? I know that living in poverty is something that is hard to do. But there are programs out there that help people in that situation. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>We just bought a house. To get benefits you cannot have assets, so I'd have to sell our house, and our house is an investment for our and our daughters future.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Now some say, Bearing hardships is irresponsible. But here you are making a way for yourself and your daughter. That is every bit of responsible. And shows that at least you're not afraid of taking on what life throws at you. I can respect someone like that. :)<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I still think that it is morally wrong to kill an child in order to correct one's past mistakes. By having an abortion, it does nothing to clear your conscience or what you have done in the past that concluded in an abortion. Abortions should only be done to victims of or if either the mother or child's health is at risk, in these circumstances. Other then that, one cannot clear their past mistakes by choosing to have an abortion. If abortions are still legal, they should require parental consent for minors in all U.S. states. That way minors should feel guilty about the mistakes that they made in the past, unless they were d. By having parental consent, the parents can deal with their daughter, instead of the government.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This is a gross oversimplification and trivialization of why women choose abortions. There are a miriad of reasons, VALID reasons, women abort. Addressing those will do miles more to reduce abortion than all the self righteous preaching, demonization and trivialization will. When I was pregnant I considered abortion. Not to " correct a past mistake " ( why is sex necesarily a mistake? we are so damned puritanical ) - but because I was being denied access to medical care and I was worried about finishing my degree ( birth control failure with a year left of university ). Had abortion been illegal, those realities would have still existed for me. I didn't need abortion restricted - I had valid issues that needed to be addressed. They were and I was delighted - and I had my baby, my medical care and got my degree - which has helped make it possible for me to succesfully raise that baby ( jobs and education are not irrelevant selfish needs ). A law that disempowered me while trivializing my needs would not have resulted in a happy ending to this story. You seem to be of the mind that pregnancy should be used punitively. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>S*x is considered a mistake if you have it before you are married. Even though there are ures that encourage teenagers to have children, they are married first. S*x is supposed to be shared by a husband and a wife, however, in our society, teens have lost all morality based on this concept, so therefore it is a mistake. But abortion does not correct a mistake because you believe that you had s*x to early, but yet creates another mistake. Unless there are health issues. Even a victim shouldn't resort to getting an abortion, in contrast to what I previously stated a few posts ago. I just cannot see how someone could give up something so precious.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>By you. This is the second time in your posts I have seen you make a sweeping generalization like this. Personally I have had plenty of sex that I have no regrets about - however, my marriage was a mistake. Um - I think you have an over-inflated idea about who is getting abortions. There are plenty of grown women, women in relationships, and married women who also get abortions. Pregnancy is a REALLY big deal. Huge impacts to life, health, and finances ( try tens of thousands of dollars just to get through pregnancy ). Believe it or not - women, as a rule, aren't sitting doing nothing except waiting to be pregnant. They have lives, responsibilities, jobs, stuff oing on. The very concept that a woman's life should be forfeit for nine months due to a rapist is one that I find beyond abhorant. I am glad that you find the potential impacts of rape precious. Having been raped - I don't. By the way - the fact that your computer edits out words like RAPE and SEX - is very telling. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Look, I'm just a devoted Catholic that thinks it's wrong to get an abortion. The mur*ering of innocent infants is cruel, and yes, I consider abortion to be mur*er. It's just like ki*ling a defenseless person. You should be ashamed of yourself... Even if you're a victim of r*pe, you still don't " mur*er " a precious, innocent, and defenseless infant. The infant had nothing to do with what happened in the past, so why are you punishing them for what someone else did to you? You should punish the rap*st for what they did to you, not the infant.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I hate this stupid argument. It has NOTHING to do with punishment. Like I said - women have LIVES. I have a job, house, mortgage, child, health, and a livlihood. I will allow none of these things to be put at risk due to a rape. Hell - I would not put them at risk due to ANY pregnancy, but I mitigate that by safe sex practices and even having my tubes tied. Expecting any woman put her life on hold and herself, family or responsibilities at risk due to a rape is straight up hateful. Demanding it against her will is a violation - just like the rape was. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So you're saying that you're life and other people's lives are more important than the life of an infant that did nothing wrong to deserve an abortion?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No. I am saying that when the needs of the mother and the needs of the fetus are in conflict - only one can prevail. Are you saying that a fetus is more important than me or my son? Take a biology course not sponsored by the Catholic church. Having different morals than you does not indicate a lack of them. Broaden your mind to the fact that there is a wide world full of people who aren't just like you. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I don't mean having different morals and such from me. But Pro-Choicers have lost all sense of morality based on their choices. Basically, you and the rest of the Pro-Choicers are saying that the k*lling of infants is alright...<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I'm wondering why she didn't get an abortion. That would have been much more preferable to this :( Probably had some barriers to getting one... bah.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Hmmm, sounds like you condone what she did......... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>lol, where did I say that? I said getting an abortion would have been preferable to killing it after it was born. I believe aborting it during the first trimester when there is no nervous system, no brain and no conciousness would have been better for everyone involved rather than this. Do you disagree?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No I don't agree........ I believe that life begins at conception..... So Let me understand, are you against abortion in the second and third trimester? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Ah, so the fact that the infant could feel pain and the fact that the mother could have put it up for adoption ( thus removing it from her care without harming it ) means nothing? No, but the first trimester makes my point stronger, and given that 95 - 98% of abortions happen then it is a valid distinction.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes but you said all abortions were justified............. which is it? I wish that every pregnant woman would carry the baby to term and put it up for adoption if she did not want it............ <br><b>S1:4-  </b>What do you mean? All abortions are justified and I am not against abortion in the 2nd and 3rd trimester. I do too :) I fully support encouraging women to carry their pregnancy to term. I do not support legally requiring it.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Yeah, reasonable people are OK with ripping unborn fetuses from their mother's wombs minutes before the baby would be born naturally! How dare those kooks try to defend the rights of the unborn fetus!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You don't really care which side, you just like the argument, huh? Where is this type of abortion commonly done? Once they have finished " ripping " the unborn ( abortion isn't very relevant once born ) fetus from the womb what do they do with it? What do you suppose the primary reason for waiting until until the baby is crowning to abort? Seems odd to go thru 9 months and labor to change one's mind. Why do suppose exaggeration and embellishment or an aversion to facts is necessary for some people who consider themselves pro life or at least anti choice? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>If you weren't a newbie, you'd know that I was anti-abortion. How many late-term abortions in which fully viable fetuses are killed are acceptable using your warped sense of morality? Mine says ZERO. You can try and deny the facts all you like. Here they are from the CDC for 2003, go spin them.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Newbie, I apologize for failing to recognize your elevated status and regret not properly researching you. Feel better now? Ahhh but that wasn't my response was it. You said To which I responded pointing out this to be an exaggeration or asked a few questions to clarify if you actually knew this to be happening. I made no mention of my position on the morality or whether I find it acceptable, but you avoided by making an assumption, throwing out an insult followed by a question. Should I consider that as yes it was an exaggeration and move on? I try not to put a spin on things. I also try to use the most relevant data as well as read those interesting little footnotes. Try it you'll see your report is off by 3 years, the numbers are similar, lower but not by much. By the way they are up to 2006 I would think <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You made an assumption about me that was clearly wrong. I pointed it out. So you consider 14,000 late-term abortions to be an exaggeration on my part? When dealing with government statistics, 6 years after the fact is pretty current. But I'm glad that you found more recent numbers to demonstrate my point. As for the shot you took on my use of references, do your research and you'll find I back up my factual assertions with references, unlike many others.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>If it had been that clear I would not have asked, but regardless you are correct it was still an assumption. What was an exaggeration by you is the quote below. Now if you want to say that what you describe below happened 14,000 times in 2003 then yes I will have problem with that as well. This was the reason I asked the questions you ignored. Make sense now? The more recent info was not to back up your point, which based on what you have posted is unclear except your pro life and don't know when late term abortions occur, but not relevant to you since you find the idea repulsive regardless of when it's done. I really don't see how A ) the more recent findings support you as while they are increasing they are lower than 2003. B) how that relates to whether someone who decides to play God, pass judgment and impose sentence on someone who is a law abiding citizen is guilty of a crime. God left us to govern ourselves on Earth. God governs in Heaven. Abortion may be a crime in heaven, but God deals with those. Here on Earth it isn't a crime and even if it was we have a process to deal with these things. Next you'll be collecting wood and kindling for the women who have abortions. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>[ QUOTE =p appillion 001 ;3 89189 ] If it had been that clear I would not have asked, but regardless you are correct it was still an assumption. What was an exaggeration by you is the quote below. Now if you want to say that what you describe below happened 14,000 times in 2003 then yes I will have problem with that as well. According to the CDC, there were ~ 14 k late-term abortions that were performed after a fetus is considered viable, so my comment about thousands was accurate and NOT an exaggeration. I see. It could be thought that my " minutes before birth " comment followed the thousands of late-term abortions. It didn't. The comments were independent of each other. Late-term is considered > 20 - 21 weeks. My point was that he didn't murder Mother Theresa, not that he wasn't guilty of murder. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. It appears that you are a drama queen. And abortion isn't legal across-the-board. Even the liberal SCOTUS that decided Roe V Wade admitted that states have the authority to regulate third trimester abortions.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>[ QUOTE = JPSartre 12 ; 38931 8] No you said ripping them from the womb minutes before they were born. That isn't late term that is birth. You know perfectly well nobody is intentionally and legally having an abortion during contractions. The exact quote is below. Why are you defending this to this extent. You said it and it was. You could have played it off and moved on. Instead you want to get sarcastic about telling me blue is really orange. You have made it a bigger deal than it was. My point was that he didn't murder Mother Theresa, not that he wasn't guilty of murder. You make no sense and this is a pretty weak attempt on your part. OK your right I'll be a drama queen, do you feel ok now? Were you able to man up with that one? Wanna maybe move on? Where are you taking this? Read what I posted in the context of the post, not some desperate attempt to save your wounded pride. How can you make a decent presentation sometimes and then come back with this? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Since you, apparently, aren    t familiar with late term abortion procedures, here it is : Note : the woman    s cervix is dilated. That is accomplished by inducing labor. When you induce labor, contractions result. Also note that the    fetus is partially-removed from the womb   . The fetus is typically turned around so that it would exit feet first because once the head is exposed, it is considered murder to kill the infant. But, as long as the head isn    t delivered before you kill the infant, it    s legal. Nice huh? See above. That    s why. Now, I understand that this barbaric practice isn    t representative of the mainstream of abortions, but it does demonstrate the lengths that pro-abortionist will go to retain    choice   . It    s a totally morally-bankrupt position, IMO. Because of the poor use of quotes, I    m clueless as to what you    re trying to say here. Care to try again? ( This forum has been quirky with quotes latey. )<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You ; re right. You might as well get a tubal ligation to go along with your the cranial removal that you already had. Social Darwinism works, I guess.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Cranial removal has been issued? I actually get the point that she's trying to make, although I don't agree with her views on the abortion issue? Why should she not be able to get an abortion, when you wouldn't let her get her tubes tied in the first place? And besides, her body is only her concern. I'm more worried about your Cranial removal than hers. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I'm not the 17 year old making a life-altering decision that she will have to live with when she actually matures.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You're not the one that has to worry about it. And besides, who are you to tell if she doesn't want it? We understand that we'll have to live with it -- Don't you think that's the first thing that goes through our minds when we finally decide? Really, we're not the ignorant teenagers that everyone wants to mark us as. We know what we're doing. And the Sickle Cell thing is true -- Why would I want to subject my child or me, to something like that? And like Ryuuchi said, she should be able to make her own decisions without people breathing down her neck, correcting her at every chance they get, telling her what she should and should not do. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So, my question to you is Why post to a debate forum and then complain about those that debate you? If you came here for automatic approval, you picked the wrong forum. This isn't the Affirmation Forum, we actually debate here.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I'm not coming here for automatic approval. I noticed the word DEBATE when I joined. If I wanted automatic approval, I would sit in front of my baby cousin, talk to her, and then say she agrees when she smiles and spits up. I'm not doing that. And in which way am I complaining? All I said was that we know what we're doing, and we don't need people breathing down our necks when we're doing it. That's not complaining, that's just saying the truth. I'm also saying that we should not be judged on our age. It's not complaining, it's the truth. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So this isn't complaining? Good thing we aren't married if you don't consider that complaining. :p<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Yes, I don't see it as complaining. But, perhaps we have different views of complaining, like people have different views of how many times you can ask for something until it's begging. Perhaps it is a good thing that we're not married, as I quite frankly don't want to be told what I should or shouldn't do. ( ^ That could possibly considered as complaining, but not anything else. )<br><b>S1:1-  </b>For a 10 year old, it spoke volumes. No, it shouldn't have been a long conversation. I answered his immediate question with enough specificity to satisfy him. The next time he asked a more probing question, I gave him additional info. You might think I'm an XXX, but I take raising my kids damn seriously. As a result, my 22 year old son isn't afraid of blacks, he doesn't bash gays, he isn't prejudiced in any way. Just as my wife and I wanted.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>about the way he has been raised. Why would he " be afraid " of blacks anyway? He isn't prejudiced in any way? Hopefully not, but his father is if he thinks gays are sick. Perhaps your son grew up free of prejudice despite your teachings. You seem to think you are not, but your last few posts make you sound like a bigot. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Have you ever been to Detroit? well, neither is the case. But, I still think that anal sex between men is sick. I also think that eating coconut is sick, too. I can't stand the stuff. Does that make me a coconut bigot, too?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I've been to Detroit. Don't actually care for it, but the art museum has this amazing Diego Rivera mural. You still haven't addressed why your son should consider being afraid of blacks. Your true colors are showing. If " sick " means, I " don't personally care for it ", I understand what you are saying. Otherwise your statements only reinforce the idea that you are bigoted. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Nice try attempting to paint me as a racist. If you think that all of Detroit's black neighborhoods are safe for whites to walk in at night, send me a PM telling me when you'll be in town next. I'll drop you off in the city at Midnight and wait to see if you make it out. The comment was made by my 10 year old son. Get with the program.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No that is not true. You said you taught your son not to be afraid of blacks. You didn't say he should be wary of unsafe neighborhoods. Here's how it went : It seems you must think this comment is racist or you would have gone to the trouble to change your story. Likewise : And you agreed with him and reiterated it : What program would that be?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>But you are supporting their right to wholesale murder of their own unborn children Sigma. How is that not supporting anarchy? What other segment of our Society has the right to kill a member of their own family because they are considered an inconvenience?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Just a nitpick here - they are not murdering anyone. Murder, by definition, is the unlawful killing of a human being. Besides the arguments over whether or not a fetus is a human being, abortion is legal, even if it were a given that a fetus is a human being, and thus cannot be murder. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yours is not a nitpick but a rationalization. Look around you oreo. Now envision all of the people you know and love. People you have known and cared for since childhood. Now think back to New Years Eve in Times Square and the million people that were there to celebrate together. Every single one of the people I've asked you to think of started out in the womb as a fetus. Are you saying that just because you can't personally hold or converse with a fetus then it has no value when you live in a World with 7 BILLION people who are all evidence of what a fetus will become if allowed to grow till its day of birth? So you see how your way of thinking and justifying abortion is nothing more than a rationalization, but an attempt at a justification? And a very weak one at that? I agree, but we live in the real World and I would compromise a perfect solution for an imperfect one if we could actually save more than a million infants, that as of today will surely die this year.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I am not saying that. I am saying that a fetus is not an existant being ( it has no mental existance ). Thus, in my view, it is at a much lower moral level than a living human being. I know I asked you to respond to it, but I meant a different post : post #107, which I would like your main response to. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And neither did you have no provable mental existence, or the people whose lives you value so much today. But you and they are all solid evidence of the intrinsic value within each of us. It's as if you're putting blinders on and saying just because I can't converse and intellectualize with an unborn child, I will call it a fetus and can in good conscience then approve of killing it before it is born. Forget the overwhelming evidence of what it will become as proven each and every time you yourself look into a mirror. I can assume it isn't a sentient being because It doesn't speak or eat or reason as I do. Do you see the incredible rationalization and foolhardiness in such self deception?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I put about as much moral value on a fetus as I do fish ( which, as a pesco-vegetarian, I eat ), as it is not sentient nor mentally existant. Yes, it is true that I had no proveable mental existance ( and, during that time, it would be perfectly acceptable if the fetus had been terminated ) and neither did those I value - you see, the main things that cause me to value these people come from the fact that they now DO have mental existence, and are sentient. No, you can assume that it isn't a sentient being because it doesn't have a mind - sort of the whole definition of sentience, now isn't it? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>But it does have a mind as is evidenced in each of us typing on these keyboards. The mind of the unborn just isn't developed yet. And you know this Oreo. Intellectually and factually you know they are people just like you. Answer me this. Is a blank DVD not yet a DVD until it has been recorded on? Or is it still a DVD, just one that hasn't been recorded on yet? I just bought a hundred new blanks and I didn't ask for that which will become DVDs once I record on them. See what I mean?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I am sorry, but your analogy does not work - for it to work, a fetus would need to have a brain and mental capabilities that are just not used yet - this is not the case : they do not have a brain, nor mental capabilities. Or, you would have to change it to speak of a piece of material that may or may not eventually be made into a DVD. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>What are you talking about? Of course a fetus has a brain. It's exactly like ours too, only smaller, in proportion to the size of its skull. Tell me Oreo, at what point in the development of a Human Being do you believe we get our brain?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>That's why abstinence-only education is so unfeasible. Agreed. It might be hard though - a lot of the anti-gay " christians " would probably protest this. Agreed. In particular I think the law should be changed so the man has an equal right to chose - he should be given the option ( during the same time the woman is given the option of abortion ) to sign a sort of contract to terminate all of their responsibilities toward the child ( and thus not have a single right of visitation, etc. if it is done ) Very true, and I definitely agree with this. Umm... I'm really not sure what you're getting at here - what's wrong with co-habitating couples? All I see with a law like this is free license for a bigoted landlord to turn down gay couples who are unable to get a marriage due to their sexual orientation. If you meant this part differently, please say so, but if you meant it how I took it, then I disagree as all it would do is make discrimination towards homosexuals even easier, in fact justified by the law, and that is just wrong.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I'm not the one that supported it in the first place. I don't think that schools should have any sex-ed. It's not their responsibility. Why would ANY Christian opposed a measure that strengthens the bonds of marriage by putting more teeth in the contract? I don't totally agree. I don't believe in letting the father walk away if the woman doesn't have an abortion. He's still on the hook financially, IMO. The enforcement today is a joke, we both agree. [ quote ] Umm... I'm really not sure what you're getting at here - what's wrong with co-habitating couples? All I see with a law like this is free license for a bigoted landlord to turn down gay couples who are unable to get a marriage due to their sexual orientation. Actually, I woud allow them to refuse renting to opposite sex unmarried co-habitants, not same sex ones. This would give heterosexual couples more incentive to " do the right thing " when considering co-habitation. Incidently, this isn't any different than what has been practiced years ago before suit-happy America. Hotels could refuse to give rooms to unmarried couples and landlords could refuse to rent to unwed couples. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I didn't mean to imply that you were supporting it. Just stating that that was the reason it wasn't feasible. As to schools teaching sex-ed, I think that it might not be their responsibility, but it is now their task - I think leaving it up to the parents would simple be impractical and lead to an even higher abortion rate than there already is. Looking at the divorce rates in the Bible Belt, I wonder why you are asking this question. I definitely agree that it should be done, but somehow I don't think it will get all that much support from these people. I definitely agree with you with that being practical, but something deep down makes me feel uncomfortable with not allowing the male the exact same rights as the woman ( she can and has the right to terminate financial responsibility but the man does not ), but at the same time I think he really has a responsibility to provide financially. I think keeping him on the hook financially is probably the most feasible. Yep, it's pretty sad. Ah, that sounds a bit better. That's an interesting view I've never seen before, it could possibly work somewhat, but I'm not totally sure on it.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I don't see how that could be possible. There are people that believe that the desensitization that takes place during sex ed classes may actually remove natural inhibitions that would otherwise stop them from having sex. Do you think that " these people " would be any harder to convince than hedonistic heathens? :) It's not possible to give the man the exact rights that the woman has. The next best thing is financial. It actually isn't a new idea. As I said before, it was standard practice back in the " sane days ". <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Let's look at this logically. You seemed to agree that abstinence-only education just doesn't really work. Now, we see all over the place people trying to get it changed in schools so abstinence only is taught - Kansas is one example of one of the really ed up sections in this. So, let's say we let these people teach their kids and not get any education at school - since you agreed that abstinence-only doesn't really work well, it will logically not work in these cases - as they are not going to get any info on safe-sex from their parents or schools, those that choose to have sex will not be informed. Get it? When dealing with bibliolaters like Archangel and his ilk, it'd be pretty much impossible. I agree it is something that should be done, I just on't think the large group of Bible-belters getting numerous divorces ( nor many other people ) will like it or support it. Yep, I concede that this is as good is it'll get. Well, I never had a problem with it, so I guess I never really thought about it - my wife and I only began living together when we got married. That said, not sure how well it will be taken in today's society, but it seems to be a solid practice.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You misunderstood my basic position. I don't believe that ANY sex ed taught in school works and may actually be counter-productive. First, it robs time that could be spent teaching what schools were chartered to teach. Second, it may actually promote underage sex by desensitizing shy kids who wouldn't otherwise have the knowledge to know what to do. I don't see why not. There are several misconceptions about the causes of the high divorce rate in the South. For one thing, they tended to marry younger than in the North. Second, they tend to marry rather than shack up. Both of these factors paint an artificial picture of marriage in the South. What's worse, IYO. A divorce rate of 50% with a marriage rate of 70% of couples or a divoirce rate of 40% with a marriage rate of 20%? I'd rather have door #1, personally. With divorce, there is at least some protection for the children. In unmarried households, it's a #### shoot. My wife and I did similarly.... almost 30 years ago.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>But what if a so-called Christian takes a position which is non-christian ( such as yours )? What then? BTW, check Exodus 21:22 - 23 for the only Biblical position regarding induced miscarriage or abortion.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>" 22 " If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely [ e ] but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands and the court allows. 23 But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise. " - Exodus 21:22 - 25 NIV It seems that God feels the life of the child is significant enough for him to say " you are to take life for life ". It seems that there is a punishment for someone else taking the life of the child... why would there be any reason to not create a law protecting the life of the child from abortion? Howard, I'm not sure I understood your first question above. Are you saying that my position is non-christian? - theo <br><b>S1:2-  </b>My point in having you read the Exodus verses for yourself was to show the ambiguity of the only verse in the Bible that even obliquely refers to abortion. My translation reads : " And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further injury, he shall surely be fined as the woman's husband may demand of him ; and he shall pay as the judges decide. But if there is any further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life. " ( Exodus 21:22 - 23 ) Since your position is not that it is Christian, but your personal faith, then I have no issue with you at all. I do ask you to question the belief because of the makeup of the female in God    s scheme of things and undue burden legislation would put on a woman. I think that Alan Simpson, Conservative Republican of Wyoming said it best when he said,    Not only shouldn    t men have a vote on the issue, they should keep their mouths shut.   <br><b> S2:2-  </b>Just because a woman is made to bear children doesn't mean she has some God given right to abort her child. I don't think you can support this view with God's word. - theo <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The issue I most often address is when people claim that it is a Christian position to be anti-abortion. If you notice, once you said it was a personal faith position, not a Christian faith position, I said : " Since your position is not that it is Christian, but your personal faith, then I have no issue with you at all.    ( Post #7 of this thread ). My position is that she was given the authority over the ovum by God in the creation of the female of the species and that it is not our place to interfere with that relationship. You cannot point to one word Jesus spoke that gave any person the right to interfere with the female reproductive process which God, in his infinite wisdom, placed within the female body. Any position that encourages that is fine as a US Citizen, but it is not Christian.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are inferring rights that aren't even given to women from the simple fact that God enabled women to have children. Women cannot have children on their own. There has to be a man in this equation. Let's imagine a married relationship where the wife is pregnant. For some unimaginable reason she wants to have an abortion but the husband doesn't want that. So the woman's right's over rule the husband's? It is his child as well. Most of all... that child belongs to God before it belongs to the woman or the man. The problem is that people are not seeking God's will in these circumstances but what best suits their own desires. Lastly, I asked you to prove to me that the Bible supports abortion... the woman's right to abort because she can carry children. Where is it? You are just making up rules to suit your desires and not depending on God's word at all. - theo<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Yes I believe in strict government regulation of business. I see the agenda behind the question.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So you for strict regulation of business but not people? Interesting... do you know who runs businesses? Yeah, people. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>This is in line with my middle left political views. Green party all the way. Unregulated capitalism is a very bad thing. Ever read Dickens?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I think there is a difference in saying what you must have and saying what you can't have. Ok, does this apply to only businesses? What if the advisory panel says " in order to maintain health for the state, every citizen is required to own a toothbrush ". A free society works by saying " you can't do this stuff but everything else is up to you guys ". If you go around saying " you must do it this way " then you really aren't a free society but you have the government controlling instead. It is just inconsistent. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No not at all it all comes down to individual rights. Business has proven that when it comes to individuial rights they can not be trusted and need to be regulated. Business will pollute the enviornment, extort the public, and exploit the poor. Unbrideled capitialism is unjust. Once again have your read Dickens? BTW why is this in the abortion forum. Unless of course you have an agenda with this thread.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I like how you say " individual rights " as if a business is some machine made up out of nowhere coming to attack the human race. A business is made up of " individuals " that are performing an activity. The activity of selling makes it a business. You can say individuals pollute and extort etc but you aren't for regulating their activity. So I take a consistent approach to this whole issue. You can regulate individuals and their activities so long as the people approve of it ( which doesn't mean I may agree with what the people wish to regulate ). Therefore if the people want to say " businesses can't pollute and homosexuals can't marry " then I believe they have every right to do so. Of course it becomes harder to regulate when mess with the constitution -- assuming US -- ( which none of the examples do ). I think you are just wrong to imply someone in a business is not part of the public. It has to do with the morning after pill <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Look at the state of business in the late 19th century when there was no regulation. Business in the name of profits would have no problem dumpping all kinds of toxic garbage into rivers and landfills if not regulated not to. If not forced to pay a minimum wage business in the name of profits would pay people an unjust wage and take advantage of thier being desprate. Business in the name of profits would cut worker safety. Busisness in the name of profits would do almost anything to cut costs. People in business, unless it effects them personally, are allways looking out for the bottom line and if there were no regulations on safety, pollution, and wages people in business will take any opportunity to cut costs.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Notice what you said here... You don't want a business to do this or that. These are restrictions as opposed to instructions. I am all for regulating some business activities as I am for regulating any individual actions. Individuals have done their fair share of " harm " outside of the activity of business. ou The thread is pretty clear about the topic... none the less, you are inconsistent here. Why are prescription drugs any different from other products? I doctor told me the other day to get a certain piece of equipment in order to help my back. Should I force WalMart to carry it? Tell me, what if the morning after pill becomes OTC? Should this change anything? Does WalMart have to carry IBuprofin along with Tylenol even though IBuprofin can cause some damage to your health? What gives the government the right to force ONE individual to sell something to another individual? I could understand the company forcing the one pharmacist to sell the drugs but at that point the company still had a choice instead of being forced by the government.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>God's gotta great gig. All the credit for the good and none of the blame for the bad.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Depends on if you're talking about the God conjured up in the imagination of utilitarians, or the true, existent God. The will of the former always ends up always conforming to the ideal lifestyle of the creature, whereas the latter insists that the lifestyle of the creature conform to His will. So much so that He orcestrated ( i. e, He didn't simply allow, but was the cause ) of the greatest natural disaster in history, killing all but 8 people in the whole earth. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I consider all gods as conjured in the imagination. " True and existent " are faith based assertions.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>ok Ok, but so would their antithesis of " untrue and nonexistent. " If we have to deny the concepts of " true and existent " on the basis that they are faith based, then we must also deny the concepts of " untrue and nonexistent, " which pretty much leaves us unable to communicate. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Really? Let's discuss unicorns.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Ok, what about them? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Reports of sightings have been shown to be untrue. Apparently this creature is in fact non-existent. I know what you mean though. It is not for me to either disprove or accept your belief as fact. Sorry for the thread drift.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I think my point is that even this statment makes entirely no sense if we apply a principle that one cannot ( or should not ) accept anything based on faith. For example, is the statement about unicorns that you made above true ( keeping in mind that truth and existence are assertions of faith )? this thread died after about three posts. So, I'm sure it doesn't really matter. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I did not suggest that nothing can be taken on faith. Nor did I suggest that all assertions of truth and existence are faith based. I did suggest that your assertion that your god is the true and existent God was faith based as are all assertions concerning supernatural beings.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Ok, so were you just simply stating your observation that " ' [ t ] rue and existent ' are faith based assertions? " And what exactly was your point in stating that observation? Right, and I think the antithesis to my proposition is an assertion of faith as well, that is, it is a belief. This might get a little confusing, so let me simplify. If the proposition " God exsists " is a faith based assertion, then so is the proposition that " God does not exist. " Either God exists or He does not. It takes faith to believe either option. You seem to disagree, but both statements are propositions that have truth values, and the one making either proposition believes them to be true. That is faith. I would obviously dispute the claim that there is no evidence that God exists, or for that matter, that there is no evidence that the God of a particular religion is the true God. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>If we substitute leprechauns then " either leprechauns exist or they don't ". Would you place, in the absence of incontrovertible proof either way, the probability of their existence at 50/50? This is what you are asking me to do with respect to God.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>A great civilization does not treat its children like this : Study : 1 In 4 Kids Go Without Health Care, CBS News Has Learned Researchers Found Bigger Health Care Gap Than Thought For Children - CBS News Unfortunately, under the aegis of the Bush / Cheney administration and the religious right, America has ceased to be a great civilization.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What ever happened to a parents responsibility to provide care for their children?

You also said that a post isn't really being dodged when someone just wants to take it to the " challengers corner " I RESPECT THAT. We have a disagreement that I feel we could both learn from in having a more formal debate. And I told you that in private message. The only reason I have been axious to debate the 14th with you Steeeve, is the fact that I don't think I could have a much stronger allie than you.... and it's a thorn in my side that we disagree on ANY aspect of the debate. I don't " need " you to make a strong Constitutional argument against elective abortion. But I would very much like for us to be on the same page as I RESPECT your skills and attention to detail. If that's a 2 year old's way of looking at this situation,... So be it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I feel like you have been baiting me on the PMs and baiting me with your previous comment.

One of the biggest downsides to online forums is not seeing the faces of those you are talking to. I honestly don't need any more adversaries in my life ( on-line or off ). It bothers me that we disagree on the applicability of the 14th,.... but not for the reasons you might think. I think I have a pretty good grasp of the situation and I base much of my arguments upon that understanding. If you ( or anyone else who's opinions I respect ) disagrees with me,....

Unless I'm wrong, I think you meant to say that you are " 100% pro-choice on abortion. " Right? I mean, you agree that children have some basic rights and the government has a legitimate role to play in protecting those rights,... don't you? And by " children " I mean those who somehow live long enough that you don't deny them anymore, of course..... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>[ QUOTE ] Well, Chuz, I'd have to say that a rapist is probably taking a choice away. As in allowing a woman to Chuz who has intercourse with her, wouldn't you agree? No, you are wrong. My point was that govt. should stay out of the citizenry's way. Its called conservatism. Asked and answered. Yes, including the right not to be raped, in case you weren't sure. Being a man ( i.e. not having the ability to carry a child ) it is not for me to force any woman to have or not have a baby, that decision is strictly for the women of the world.

But don't YOU agree that an abortion takes something away from the child being aborted? Well, you've already stated as much in some of your earlier posts, CUNx,...

However, the choice to end it or carry the baby to term, must lie with the one who does the carrying.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Oh, I think we both can agree, CUNx.... the " choice " to continue a pregnancy or not is ultimately the would be mother's to make. We have no difference between us as to who's " choice " it is. Where we differ is at the point where it comes down to what the consequences of that choice ( the killing of the child she created and no longer wants to carry ) should be.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Quite so. We value the beginning stages of human life...<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Not as much as later stages of human life, apparently. Interesting choice of words. Is autonomy the condition determining where you draw the line as to when eliminating the developing human life is acceptable or not? Let's look at the definition. Autonomous - existing and functioning as an independent organism. An independent organism? Yikes, that's certainly open to debate, isn't it? I mean, a 5 year old cannot rationally be considered independent of the mother. Do you support the mother's right to kill her 5 year old? I'm sure you don't. At what point do you consider ending a developing human life immoral? Oh that's right, it's not your decision to make. Slaves are made slaves completely against their will. Women usually become pregnant as a result of activity in which they willingly engaged. There's a difference. By your definition, a parent who makes their child do chores without pay is a slave master. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I'm a Roe supporter, DrNo. That's where I draw lines. And I've said that many, many, many, many, many times. Clearly I'm referencing here a point in time that doesn't even exist, and therefore cannot serve realistically as a point of comparison. Try harder to understand the statements you respond to, or I won't bother responding to you anymore. Of course, there's a difference. I'm drawing a parallel DrDumb. The point is the control over person's bodily activities. Oh please. Children need adults to take care of them, and are educated by parents, thus, learning about responsibility and what it takes to be a responsible adult. Get real for once.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So you believe in a definition that cannot be defined? You just said you are referencing a point in time that doesn't exist. Seriously? Oh no! DrDumb ; that's real mature. I'm not against a person being in control of their own bodily activities. For example, a person should be able to shoot a gun. After all, they have a right to choose what they do with their own bodies, right? If somebody happens to be in the way of the gun, that's not the shooter's fault. That person should have moved. They are in control of their own body too, and if they don't choose to move, they are accepting the consequences of that action. Who are we to determine whether these people are moral in their actions? It should be left up to them. Children need adults to take care of them, so they are not actually autonomous. That means women should have the right to a post birth abortion up until the child turns 18. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No, I do not believe in people who do not yet exist.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Your belief or lack thereof does not change the scientific fact that a fetus is a developing human being. Puberty is another stage of human development. Maybe I believe pre-pubescent people don't exist? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>If there's no brain and they aren't born, you may.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Well, the problem with cynicism is the person has had a lot of bad experiences in life, but not a lot of good ones. Those good experiences are part of reality too, and without which, we don't have a very realistic grasp of things. I am fortunate because I've had family members who've fought in certain wars, and my family oral history is alive enough, for me to have an identification with certain ancestors, and what they fought for, as well. This gives a person a certain personal feeling of possession about history, which I think the American public school system, for the most part -- at least when I was attending ( which is not recently ) -- tends to take that away from people. But the history of this country is ours, not the historians, though I like historians today fine enough. You know what I mean, I think. To me, calling a person a terrorist is an extremely denigrating descriptive. I'm not going to denigrate John Brown. I refuse to characterize him as such. No one's going to take my history away from me. Besides, everyone's a terrorist, lately. And I think we will outgrow this perspective, too.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Be consistent in your comparisons. If one man murders people in what he believes to be a righteous cause, and he is a hero, then another man who does the same is a hero. By the same token, if one is a terrorist, the other is a terrorist. John Brown was motivated by noble ideals. Scott Roeder was motivated by what many people view as noble ideals. There isn't a difference between the two. Many thought slavery was a terrible thing, many thought it was necessary. Same with the abortion debate. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I haven't read anyone as saying that Roeder was motivated by noble ideals. Just that, because there is holocaust of millions of babies, they can understand why he did it. There is one important difference. Slavery involved real human beings and was a terrible thing. There is no holocaust of millions of babies.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Do you realize the ones who believe that Roeder was motivated by noble ideas are the ones that don't get press time? So, abortion doesn't involve real feti? Are you telling me that those feti are just baby dolls that look extremely realistic? Who are you to say that abortion isn't terrible? It scars women for long after it happens and creates a large emotional stigma. It's terrible to the people who have to make the decision in the same way that slavery was terrible to the slaves. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Well, they have plenty of press time here. So if you think Roeder was motivated by noble ideals, you are free to make your insane case. Abortion involves a real embryo or fetus. That embryo and fetus are the real thing. Who are you to say, unless it's your body? Rubbish. Women are generally relieved, after having an abortion, and besides, it's up to the woman in question as to whether or not she wants to do anything that risks " emotional stigma. " Only if women don't have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. But in the United States, where I live, women have had the right to choose since Roe V Wade was passed.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Obvioulsy, I don't believe Roeder was motivated by anything good. I'll concede that they aren't babies, but you're still killing something. Have you had an abortion? Can you show me women who are relieved? And I'll specify it to come to terms with Tiller, can you show me a woman who is relieved to have a late term abortion? I'm sure there are many women who have early term abortions that are relieved, but the women who carry it around with them and then decide to kill it can't feel relieved. And it's not physical slavery, but emotional slavery. The women who have late term abortions or changes of heart after the fact are bound emotionally to the decision. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Of course you are. The American Psychological Association has published research showing that women, for the most part, feel relieved. Still meaning, either way, it's the woman's right to choose. Well, it's their decision. Between that individual and their physician, and anyone else they freely choose to involve in that decision. Right or wrong for them, it's their decision to make, not yours or mine, and none of our business.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You failed to answer a question. Have you had an abortion? I'm not arguing against abortion or for it, I'm arguing against your faulty premise that the abortion debate can't be related to slavery. Cite your source on that APA study. Because I found multiple sources that say while some women feel relieved, others have emotional problems. I would like to know whether these women had early or late-term abortions. Either way, I doubt the majority is relieved.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I asked you this question a while back but you didn    t answer so I will try again. Do you remember being born?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Can you explain the relevance of that question as it applies to the abortion debate? Are you actually implying that if we don't remember an event then we weren't sentient or mentally competent at the time it occurred? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The reason you don    t remember being born is because you were not sentient by any stretch of the imagination. The hamburger you ate for lunch was more sentient at one time then you were at birth.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Really? So you are fine with killing newborns now because you believe they aren't yet sentient beings? At what point in human development do you believe human beings deserve human rights protection not to be murdered, accipiter? Now this is an honest and legitimate question based on your previous statement, so please attempt to just answer it without sarcasm if that is possible. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>well now you are just being ridiculous. If you want a straight answer you might try a worthy question.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Really? You said this, which seems to be saying that newborns aren't even sentient beings. So I asked this question, and you are saying it is just ridiculous? What is ridiculous is that I wasted my time asking you to support anything you say with a rational, well thought out answer at all.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>And I suppose the three New York police officers who gunned down the black groom on his wedding day in a hail of 51 bullets, were just innocent men who were doing their jobs. Here's the thing that you don't seem to get. Well actually two things. First, the man in question wasn't permitted to kill anyone. Second, we're not a civilized society.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You make an odd comparison here. How does Dr. Tiller engaging in his medical practice resemble the tragic shooting of an innocent man by police officers? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Well according to some, both parties in this comparison were just doing their job. In the case of the police, it was killing an innocent man with greatly excessive force and destroying the public's trust and support of police officers. In Tiller's case, he was killing unborn children who could safely be brought to full term. No matter how many times you try and rehash the point, it doesn't matter. Tiller killed children just before they could legally be classified as people and awarded protections under the law. If he had killed them outside of the womb he would've been facing the death penalty or life in a maximum security prison. Yet doing the exact same thing a week before delivery is supposedly better and morally superior.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Which is NOT the issue here. It doesn't matter what you think of Dr. Tiller's legal medical practice. There was NO justification for someone to murder him. You continue to act as though Tiller should be held somehow morally responsible for his own death. No. He was the murder victim. There was ONE wrong here, and that was the murder of Dr. Tiller. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Nobody's arguing otherwise. However the truth about Tiller's practice must be taken into account as well. A victim, perhaps, but he wasn't an innocent victim.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>He was innocent under the law, and he was providing a needed medical service for women. Dr. Tiller's work took a lot of courage, given the death threats he received and the attacks he suffered even before this murder. Dr. Tiller was a courageous man who stood by his convictions, and it led to his being killed. How tragic. What a loss. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Oh grow up! We all know about the many cases of doctors performing unnecessary surgeries, mongering the fear of cervical cancer to scare women into getting hysterectomies that they don't need, and reaping the profits that come from such illegal and immoral practices. Tiller was just another one of these doctors, performing unnecessary abortions, killing countless healthy babies that could've been safely delivered without posing a health risk to the mother. A needed medical service to women? What a crock! What was stopping them from having the fetus aborted when it was just a mass of cells similar to a parasite? Why did they have to wait until it was just before delivery time to decide that they didn't want it?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I am grown up. I am 54 years old, which is plenty grown up. I respect the work that Dr. Tiller did. And he was providing a needed medical service for women. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>A needed medical service... yeah right! If these women truly were in need of abortions they would've gotten them earlier on when they weren't developed. They wouldn't have waited until it was down to the wire just to let the killing happen if they truly needed to have an abortion, they would've done it immediately after finding out they were pregnant.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>It's not up to you to decide when someone else should have an abortion or any other medical procedure. It's none of your business. It's up to the woman and her doctor. You have no say in it.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Yes, it was a story about my work colleague. Her husband and daughter are doing well, apparently, several years after my colleague died. But I know you don't care, Ryuuichi.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Indeed I really don't. Still people don't care about those fetuses who are in pain as they're aborted so I consider it fair. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I honestly do not care if you care. Feel free to not care or to care as you choose. But you must care about the issue of abortion enough to post here. As for whether fetuses feel pain, it's not my business to worry about this. Issues involving a fetus are the concern of a woman choosing or not choosing an abortion, in consultation with her doctor.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Not really its lulzy watching you people get so angry about a subject that is a societal matter and considering it personal. Then those same people want to deny a similar right to a different group of people ( men ) its utterly hypocritical because then they claim it to be a societal matter. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>What is the similar right? Please explain what you think people want to deny to men. No disrespect intended. I don't understand your post.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Financial abortion. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Ummm, do you mean that women have the right to choose abortion for financial reasons but men do not have that right and must pay child support for the children they father, with no right to decide to terminate the pregnancy? I still do not understand your argument, which is why I'm asking for clarification.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No. Everything's right except termination. They don't care if the baby lives or dies they shouldn't have to support it.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Would it make you feel better if he'd been run over by his attacker after stepping into the parking lot?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I don't know about you, but violent acts against people in houses of worship seem particularly disgraceful. In this case, it also goes to the hypocrisy of the criminal's argument, given that the murderer based his views on the Christian faith and dictum of not taking a life, and went into a Christian church on a Sunday and took a life. In a way, in his lunacy, I think he saw himself as God, and entitled to act as God. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>This man killed countless hundreds, possibly thousands, of innocent children before they were even born. He cut them up and threw them away in the dumpster behind his office like fast food leftovers. I find it particularly disgraceful that any church would allow a butcher / murderer like this to even set foot on the property.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Pure hyperbole. Please see my longer post to jyotsu. Ibid. Your initial premise is not established. Number two, even if it were, are you consistent in that view? For example, do you find it disgraceful that the Catholic Church, for example, allows non-penitent Holocaust participants to retain their status as Catholics? Do you think someone should go in there on Sunday with a gun, and take care of them, too? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>By who's decision? Again, by who's decision? Personally I find the whole religion to be highly questionable. Their stance against birth control even though it could cut down on the number of unwanted children in third world countries that're going to die an easily avoidable death, their belief that a woman becomes a saint upon having 12 children, and their soft hand approach to the pedophile priests, makes them a religion that I have no care for. I could care less about what happens to a bunch of catholics. Your attempt to confuse the issue and shift the nature of the discussion isn't going to work ; Tiller was a mass murderer of innocent children and who knows how many adult women. Simply because he struck one day or one week before the subject could legally be classified as a person is irrelevant and avoiding responsibility at its best. Had he not been killed by one person now, he would've eventually been arrested and given the death penalty for his actions.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The thinking community's consensus that statements of fact be established by evidence. On forums, that means cited articles following recognized rules for objective reporting in journalism. Ibid. You said that you objected to a church allowing a baby bucher to set foot in their house of worship. So are you now saying that you only object when it's a Lutheran church, but not a Catholic church? Again, even if we assume for a moment that you are right ( and you have not established that premise ) -- non-penitent Holocaust participants who are still allowed to attend Catholic churches murdered innocent children adn adult women, too. You are ignoring the realities of late-term abortions. Whereby the journalists took a statement out of context and deliberately did not allow the viewers to hear what the doctor was saying in its entirety. That is not true. He was lawfully practicing medicine.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Thing is I can admit they're terrorists. You don't seem to have that ability. Also : LOL At you thinking they fought for you. They fought for themselves the THEIR families like most humans do. They don't give a d*** about you.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Then I feel sorry for you in your pool of cynicism. I'm PROUD of John Brown, as an American. I know he was a man who loved his country, deeply spiritual and ahead of his time, and I know he wanted to end slavery. And I feel grateful to the men and women who've risked or given their lives for our freedoms. You think you've seen life, but you haven't. ( Not that I have so much, either, but in this respect, I think I have a little moreso. ) <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I rather be a cynical person with a realistic outlook on life then a optimist who ends up disappointed. I've seen people get raped, murdered, for thinking people were " nice and trying to do things for them. " I've been abused and betrayed by people I trusted. Heh. If you've seen more then me then I pity you. Your life must well and truly suck. If you're foolish enough to think that those people did it for you then go ahead but based of my life experiences they did it for themselves. That's how people are even the most " pure " of people do it for the gratification of helping someone else. Ultimately 99% of human behavior is self-serving. That's how we as a species are. Personal interpretation is a beautiful thing isn't it?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well, the problem with cynicism is the person has had a lot of bad experiences in life, but not a lot of good ones. Those good experiences are part of reality too, and without which, we don't have a very realistic grasp of things. I am fortunate because I've had family members who've fought in certain wars, and my family oral history is alive enough, for me to have an identification with certain ancestors, and what they fought for, as well. This gives a person a certain personal feeling of possession about history, which I think the American public school system, for the most part -- at least when I was attending ( which is not recently ) -- tends to take that away from people. But the history of this country is ours, not the historians, though I like historians today fine enough. You know what I mean, I think. To me, calling a person a terrorist is an extremely denigrating descriptive. I'm not going to denigrate John Brown. I refuse to characterize him as such. No one's going to take my history away from me. Besides, everyone's a terrorist, lately. And I think we will outgrow this perspective, too. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If the guy was considered a terrorist when he first did it, is considered a terrorist now... I highly doubt that's going to change. Like I said personal interpretation. This argument is really going nowhere you're not going to consider a cold blooded murderer a terrorist and I'm not going to consider him anything but. Also : Lol at the no grip on reality. That can go both ways you know! I think my grip on reality is a bit too strong. Yours is the one that probably needs to tighten up a bit.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So that's why union soldiers sang a tributary hymn to John Brown as they marched into battle? And why we still sing it today? Because John Brown was defined as a terrorist? And why we have great works of art depicting Brown as intimately with God, and being kissed by the common people as he was led, walking proudly, to the gallows? I don't know what country you've studied music or art in. But obviously, you versed in historical revisionism. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Yeah you obviously didn't read my posts. Some considered him a hero some considered him a terrorist, some considered him both. Is that so hard for you to understand. Also I don't sing hymns about terrorists. And art is subjective there's plenty of art depicting Hitler in a good light. Why would you use something as subjective as art? I find a drawing of an angel and a demon being lovers. Heck I found one of Hitler and Hussein making out. Just because someone writes / draws something doesn't make it automatically true. You're in your own world at this point. Even when your fellow pro-choicers point out the hypocrisy of your statements you ignore them. I can't debate with someone who refuses to see the other side of the argument because it means that you will never understand my point of view. This time I'm ending the argument. I can't argue with people like you. You're the same as those pro-lifers who insist that abortion is wrong regardless and don't listen to what anyone says not to change their minds but merely to let the see the other point of view. Its kind of funny how similar the two sides are in the end.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I responded to your post word for word, using a cut and paste that proves it. Now you're engaged in blatant dishonesty. It's not my fault if you can't express yourself coherently. You are incorrect ITO of the extent to which people perceived him in a negative light, with the exception of the Confederacy. And American history has paid tribute to John Brown quite grandly through highly valued, timeless and famous pieces of music and art. There is no such immortalization, on such a scale, otherwise. Then I don't believe you went through the American public school system, since students quite commonly sing hymns to John Brown as part of music. Your " terrorist ", that is... You argued that Brown is conceptualized in our national consciousness and definition as " a terrorist ". I am demonstrating that he was not then, and he is not, now. Brown was very religious, as most abolitionists were, but the similarity ends there, along with the form of Christianity they were practicing. Among the pro-choice movement, there is a lot of diversity in background and beliefs. I think you are oversimplifying.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Tiller was not the only physician who provided late-term abortions.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I was told that he was one of only a handful, and the only one in Kansas. My last post on this thread was based on that information, so if it is incorrect than I apologize. If it is true, than I am sure that Tiller had appointments that were set before his death that could not be kept and the financial obsticles to finding another Dr. in a timely manner should have caused actual births OR terrible complications since that is the only reason people get late term abortions.... according to some. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You may be correct about the state of Kansas. I was speaking of the nation of America, still granting liberty and justice to women, relatively speaking, not to mention being free to pursue happiness.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This is obviously very much a " women's " issue for you and I respect that. I don't know about the liberty and justice aspect, or the persuit of happiness aspect of your arguement, since I hate the use of abortion as birth control. From your posts I believe you feel the same way. From a constitutional point of view... Chuz-Life made me research that in detail and I can not find constitutional protections for the unborn. The Constitution clearly protects those born.., ie ; the woman. From a legal point of view, the outcome of R. v W. appears to have been correct. But I don't have to like it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>My view is that the rights of a fetus come more and more into play as a fetus reaches a point of viability viable outside of the womb. How to define these rights and their stages is a gray, murky area.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Chuz-Life has offered to show me where the constitutional rights extend into the womb. Until he does, I believe as a nation we are bound by those protections for those it applies to. Specificly those who are on this side of the birth canal. Having said that, as a nation it would be nice if we could come to some kind of compromise on the abortion issue. At the risk of sounding like the occupant of the White House, I think that rational thinking Americans could probably agree that at some point, ( as you state ), the fetus is a child. Since we refuse to define that point, being the " advanced " civilization that we are, we should be able to agree that somewhere within the second and third trimester that transisition occurs. And that abortions during the later terms of the pregnancy should only be allowed within the bounds of an emergency. HOWEVER, the extemes on both sides of the issue will never let that happen, and currently the pendulum is on the left.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>He can't help it Steamroller, he's a troll. He doesn't contribute relevant content, he snipes like penfold and the obvious child do. And your guestimate that he is 12 is a bit generous, don't you think?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The above is a definitive troll post. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not at all. It is a definitive comment on a trolls post. But why would I expect another troll to recognize the difference?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It is you who are frequently taken to task for not knowing the difference about many things...... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It occurs to me that attempting to deal with trolls like you is a waste of time and energy, so I will just let the bible speak for me with you and your ilk from now on. Jhn 8:44 You are of [ your ] father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own [ resources ], for he is a liar and the father of it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>" It is my belief... that the truth is generally preferable to lies. " ~ Albus Dumbledore So where does that leave you? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>It leaves me beyond basing my life beliefs on a fictional character from a children's series, that's where. How about some eternal truth for a change? Rom 1:22 Professing to be wise, they became fools, Rom 1:23 and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures. Rom 1:24 Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them. Rom 1:25 For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I think the point is to debunk the idea that the fetus is not a human which some argue. And to say a fetus is a human but not a person is putting yourself along the lines of people that thought a black was a human but not a person. I don't know of any humans that are not people... its the only fair and not discrimative way to look at it.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Surely its still a human and a person when its a blastocyst as well though... so showing that it looks more like a baby is largely irrelevant. I didn't think any pro-choice supporters ( or hardly any anyway ) based their views on what it looks like. Its generally what it can do ( or stage of development ) which is important or its doesn't matter in the slightest as its ' trespassing ' anyway. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>There are many on here that think at no point in the pregnancy is the being in the women a human. If this is true then maybe pictures are important.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>A person, but this isn't based of their appearance. Shave a chimp and it will probably look vaguely human ( an ugly one though ), doesn't mean it has more rights than a non-naked one. Its not the appearance which makes people think it doesn't count as a person, its the lack of a functioning brain. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>maybe to you. I have had some say it is " just a clump of cells " though. And thus the pictures. As for a functioning brain, What level of function is required to be a person? Who decided this and what authority do they have?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>At some point it is just a clump of cells though - you realise most pro-choices don't believe in abortion at any point in the pregnancy regardless, but only up to a certain period. As for functioning brain, before then it feels nothing and can not think, nor ever has. Just sharing some similar DNA is not enough to make it count at this point. Soon as its a proper individual with its own mind then I wouldn't agree with aborting it except for medical reasons. Who decided this? Seems common sense to me, with the least harm being done. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Jitobear and others seem to think you can abort or kill so long as the baby is dependent. In fact, jitobear just stated that if there can be a way that the fetus can be permentantly attached the mother for life and the mother wants it, that this should be allowed and abortion should remain on the table for that length of time. Do you agree with this stance?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The facts of that were as follows : Parent rights a note saying " Don't do drugs " and was a strong opponent of marijuana. You then went and assumed the message was for recreational drugs, and that the reason not to do them was because they are bad. Afterwards you based a conclusion on that. Lets take this example and convert it to a law. The constitution says " dont do drugs " and at the time marijuana was illegal and considered a drug. Fifty years later scientists claim marijuana is actually good for you. Does this make it so marijuana can no longer be forbidden by the constitution if a judge agrees with the scientist using the rubric you find so dear? I would say the only reasonable view of that law would be to say that unless congress changes the law ( or amends the constitution ) then marijuana will always been considered under that law. Otherwise you have changed what it meant. You assumed things that might misrepresent what the law meant just like I can assume things and misrepresent what you say. When this happens what you said or what the law says didn't change.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You're not talking about static meaning, you're talking about static application of the law. The most rational and logical view would be to look at the meaning of the prohibition ( that recreational drugs are detrimental and have no legitimate benefit ) and then say " pot has been shown to have major benefits and few detriments. Therefore, by the meaning of the prohibition, pot is exempted from the ban ". The meaning was preserved and the application of the law is allowed to change to meet the changing society and situations. Imagine the Constitution had no specific prohibition against blacks. Regardless of the personal feelings of the authors, interpreting the meaning of the Constitution would allow them equal rights. Similarly, regardless of the personal feelings of the parents interpreting the meaning of the prohibition would allow pot to be exempted. That is the most rational conclusion. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Again, you just added stuff that didn't exist in my example. It had no prohibition against woman yet they did not have equal rights. Took the 19th amendment just to force states to let them vote.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>lol, Steve. Whatever meaning you wish to put, if the meaning no longer applies to pot then pot should not be covered by the ban regardless of how the authors felt about pot specifically. You seem to want a static application but you're inconsistent about it. Then by the meaning of the Constitution such an Amendment wouldn't be strictly required and laws prohibiting women from voting could be struck down as unequal application of law ( after Incorporation, anyway ). However, as with any law, saying something specifically eliminates wiggle room and prevents jokers, such as yourself, from saying " original application didn't cover women omg omg! " ;) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not sure what you are saying but are you saying the 19th amendment is not required? Seems the 14th amendment never worked before including a Supreme Court case that rejected the idea that the 14th amendment gave the right to vote for woman.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Could you cite the case? That's the point, Steve. If there are possibly multiple interpretations then without an explicit Amendment there is no guarantee. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Minor vs Happersett It argues using the same method every judged ( for the most part ) used until the early to mid 1900 s. Finally, your comment makes no sense. If there are " multiple interpretations " then an amendment is never a guarantee... not even the 19th.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>lol, the case supports my view. The case even stated that equal application would indeed nullify the law and allow women to vote if voting were a Constitutionally protected right. They decided the " right of suffrage " was not Constitutionally protected. If the right of suffrage is one of the necessary privileges of a citizen of the United States, then the constitution and laws of Missouri confining it to men are in violation of the Constitution of the United States, as amended, and consequently void. The direct question is, therefore, presented whether all citizens are necessarily voters. Were it decided that voting was a right of a citizen then equal protection would do the job of the 19th. Whether women were originally intended to be included is irrelevent. My statement stands ;) An unambiguous Amendment would be less subject to interpretation. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Not sure how that supports your view unless your view is that the 19th amendment was needed and I already stated I think it was but your view wouldn't. Did you just not read the case? I'm not exactly sure what you are thinking but the case ruled the 14th amendment ( 9 - 0 I might add ) doesn't protect a womans right to vote. Please enlighten us on how this even remotely supports your viewpoint. " Due Process of Law " seemed rather unambiguous too but we see how that one turned out.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>While I failed to take into account that voting is not a right and so my claim was not true, my view is still validated. It doesn't matter the view of the authors, or whether or not women were excluded at the time of writing. All that matters is the message of the Constitution and the meaning behind it. Many of the Amendments are written in a rather ambiguous manner, including the 14th. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>which has never been your thoughts until this very post and I still doubt you mean it. My point is that the meaning behind the constitution does not change and the meaning certainly doesn't change to fit with " current times ". This case uses originalism to make the decision and did so according to the law. The fact that voting was a privilege of some didn't mean it ever applied to voting. I'd say this amendment is rather clear... even more so for the due process clause. Would you disagree?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>SO we either have spineless weasels or spineless whimps. Doesnt seem like much of a choice does it? I guess there just isn't justice anymore for the little guy huh?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Don't rule out the possibility of a Tea Party. It's looking more and more like a solution to me. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yeah thats all you need. A fairy being called a teabagger wearing an indian costume... I know that crowd isn't gay friendly anyways lolz.... Besides I wouldn't be caught dead tossing tea over a boat. I'm a tea addict so I'd probably just snatch a box and stash it if it really came down to it lol. Espcially if it's sleepy time tea... Omg JP look for it in your grocery store it's the best flavor of tea ever. Served hot of course...<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Isn't it interesting how the left has no problem making sexual inuendos about the right, but they scream bloody murder when the tables are reversed. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Lol I'm not screaming I'm just sayin people would find it odd a gay man being called a teabagger lmao... Would kind of make people do a doubletake or at least smirk... And I dunno I think I heard keith complain once about something about feminism or something I dunno and I'm too tired to remember...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Sorry, my comment wasn't directed at you. I don't think of you as being a whiney leftist. A drama queen at times, yes, but not a whiney leftist. The thought just happened to be triggered by your teabag reference. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Oh no! * gasp* * faint* Lol I'll take my Oscar now. :)<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I am glad you quoted inalienable and defined alienated.... we are talkingabout UNalienable and alienable. How so? If my right to life is withdrawn then it doesn't matter if I am killed or not because I never had a right to live in the first place. This is not the case. But we are not talking about alienated... we are talking about alienable. Alienable is different because it involves transfer. So the word alienated doesn't go here... I don't know where that came from. Unalienable rights, means rights that can't be seperated nor taken away. And the right to life cannot be taken away. Someone can't take your right to life. How does one transfer a right to life from one to another? If you wish to believe this, then you don't believe in the foundation of this country. Also with this belief, you would say that slavery was ok and that blacks being denied rights was ok and women being denied rights was ok. If the government makes rights then the right to a black person to be free ( live ) didn't exist. If it didn't exist then it wasn't wrong. How could slavery be wrong if there was no right against it? The ides that government creates rights is the non-sense.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I see you again shy from discussing rights outside of gov't. Says much about your argument, that you are unwilling to discuss rights in a natural state, while claiming they exist at the same time. hypocritical. The declartion is irrevelant because it does nothing. It didn't give anyone rights. It wasn't even practiced! You can say you have all the rights in the world, but until you enforce them, you have nothing. I ASK AGAIN. Does the ocean abide to your right to life as you slowly drown? ANSWER IT OR CONCEDE THE ARGUMENT Good. We still are. I a merely going deeper into what those mean. Why not? That is exactly how it works. If you right can be removed it is not inalienable. Alienable means able to be alienated. The dictionary. The foundation of this government is based upon self governorness and freedom from dictatorship. Not rights. How so? I never said that was correct. My entire argument is that rights only exist if they are enforced. You are arguing that rights exist as a universality, yet you constantly AVOID arguing outside of goverment. Slavery is wrong for economic reasons. The idea that rights exist otuside of goverment is nonsense. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>INalienable does not equal unalienable alienate does not equal alienable Alienable means transferable of ownership to another. Alienate means more of a withdrawn in this case. if you believe this, you might want to take a few more US history course. We refer to the Declaration of Independence ( DOI for short now ) because it shows this best. The DOI says we have rights... England was stomping on this rights which are unalienable... therefore, we ( US ) will make our own country. This started it all. And what do you think freedom is? It is the ability to have your rights not stomped on by the government. As for the slavery example... you would be claiming that the slaves had no rights back then. So then why was it wrong? For economic reasons??? Slavery was only wrong for economic reasons? It had nothing to do with the treatment of people?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If your right existed, and was inalienable, then the ocean would abide to it. That obviously is not true.

If it someone wrote it down, is it therefore true? Rights to exist, must be enforced. No, England was ruling the colonies without representation by the colonies. This country was built upon self governring and freedom from dictatorship. Freedom is the ability to do what one pleases. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>UNalienable... NOT INALIENABLE And why did they think that? What does the DOI say for reasons? It says that they are being a pain in the butt... because they are stomping on their rights.... How did they have rights if a government didn't give it to them... they say they had natural rights " endowed by the Creator ". It doesn't make it true... but in the case of the DOI it shows what our country is based on... the belief of rights given to us by the creator that the government can't stomp on. So we had a right then huh?... the DOI clearly states why we split away, you can't argue that... I will even post the DOI if I have to.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It doesn't matter goverment or not.

I can't believe I am even talking about this... Although they are close Unalienable : Not to be seperated, given away, or taken away, or inaliebable Inalienable : cannot be transfered. The point is... Unalienable is a bit more... this doesnt matter... use the DOI word... UNALIENABLE. They were " stomped " on.. not taken away. The people that fought for independence thought that rights were unalienable... how could you deny this? They wouldn't say unalienable if they meant they wanted their own government to create their owns rights.... Why didn't they want this? Because it would mean that the government they created could do the same thing... Thus they believe rights were actually unalienable. Didn't we already address this?... your examples make no sense<br><b> S2:4-  </b>The mean the same thing. I even gave you the dictionary definition which states they are the same thing. Are you saying that webster is wrong? They never had them in the first place. What they believed is irrevelant. They never had them unless they were enforced. They make perfect sense. If a right is inalienable or unalienable, same thing, then only God can remove it. Chloe. I responded to your post. You have yet to reply.

Well considering I never said what you fabricated, you're asking the wrong person. Perhaps you have confused me with someone else. Fetuses do exist. All existing cells have age.

I picked up { maybe wrongly } from your post that you were against it. apologies for my mistake<br><b>S1:1-  </b>This is the view which drives the pro life movement : That the creator created human beings in His image and imparted value, meaning, purpose, and dignity. I will argue that it is the view which presents the highest view of human life, and thus the highest view of women. This view allows that there is inherent dignity within each human life and therefore everyone should be treated with dignity and respect. And, even if they aren't, their life has value. This value was not given by humans and therefore cannot be taken away by humans. The predominate view which is at the heart of the pro choice movement is secular humanism. Everything has happened by chance and therefore mankind is a random wart on the face of a random meaningless chance universe. Therefore all human life is just the sum of its parts and is no better than dirt. It has no inherent meaning. Therefore, women have no value - they are no better than dirt. Therefore, the view which predominately drives the pro life movement places a view of women that is exceedingly and abundantly trancendent above the view which predominately drives the pro choice movement. The pro life view of women is of a different quality and order.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Therefore the view which predominately drives the pro-choice movement places a view of women that is exceedingly and abundantly transcendent above the view which predominately drives the ant-choice movement. The pro-choice view of women is of a different quality and order because it trusts a Creator who gave women dominion over the ovum and trust the female of the species as the Creator did. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yeah spin it spin it. spin my words some more. yeah yeah. You wish that a divinely imparted responsibility to nurture and care for the child included a liscense to kill it. But... it doesnt. quit trying to manipulate.

This thread is about the pro life camp having an exceedingly higher view of women than the pro choice.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>chloe I am simply making it clear that you do not know the mind of God. You do not know his infinite wisdom in placing the ovum and biology necessary for gestation and parturition with the female. God gifted things to the female unique to her and gifted her with a free will as well. As Jesus said,    What God has joined together, let no man put asunder.    That is exactly what you are proposing and then arrogantly claiming some superior position. My responses is to your thread. You may not like what I am saying, but it is perfectly valid    or do you think everyone is just supposed to shut up and kneel where you tell them to? This thread is full of false claims and faulty reasoning and religious misrepresentation. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>go ahead open up the other thread - or are you afraid people may see what you are actually saying and what you are really all about. sorry that i have misrepresented the god of howard beale : that is - himself. like i said, the responsibility given to the female to nurture and care for her child does not include a divine right to kill that child. also, like i said, this thread is about the pro life view of women being much higher than the view which drives the pro choice view of women.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>chloe : Ridicule and sarcasm    that is the response when you can    t refute what someone who disagrees with you and points out the fallacy of your position says. Really? You know the mind of God? This is a thread about you misrepresenting the position of people who believe that God gave women a free will and you have no right to wrest that from them. You cannot expect to misrepresent people and them have them just sit silently. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I have already refuted you. open up the other thread. I know the mind of the one true God in as much as He has made himself known through scripture. However, I make no claim to know the mind of you.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You refuted nothing. You avoided as you are now. Although here you admit that you really believe that you know the mind of God. That is stunning. Your position is clear. You know God's mind and you are an instrument of the Lord and I guess all of those who disagee with you are disagreeing with God -- we all are just Satan's minions I guess. Do you really believe that? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>how did you guess? yeah, you are right. i think you are just satan's minion. and i know who killed jimmy hoffa and jfk. also, elvis is living in my basement. he is sharing a room with 2 pac. but please, lets just keep that between you and me.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>And you know better than all of us, because, as you said, you know the mind of God. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>only that which he has revealed in his word. i dont know the mind of you.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>And what do your scriptures say about abortion? Will you share that with us?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You say you have no religious beliefs... but you capitalise Science? Fair. The changes that take place at delivery are that the foetus becomes a separate organism, with it's own oxygen supply and it's own food supply rather than sharing it's bloodstream with it's mother. The changes that take place at conception are that new DNA is created. The changes that take place over a period of time during pregnancy is that a foetus gains a complex enough mental state to be called ' concious '. What are the changes that take place at blastocyst implantation, and what makes them so significant that you can elevate them above any one of the three ' turning points ' above? Science doesn't say that.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>iangb : I speak Spanish. My knwoledge of English grammar is not perfect, of course. Do you know what is breast feeding? Human beings are mammalians? Do you know what parental duties means? Are you sure : a ) That a four or five month fetus has not conscience? b ) That a newborn has fully developed conscience? Do you know when synapses emergence is over? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes, I know what it is. I also know of mothers who have never breast-fed. Are you trying to imply that, because a baby is sometimes breast-fed, it retains a biological connection to the mother similar to the umbilical cord? I'd call that stretching the boundaries of ' biological connection ', personally... Before birth, if the mother dies, the foetus dies ( with one noticable exception that I know of ). After birth, this is no longer the case. Again, yes. How is this relevant to turning points ' in the eyes of science '? Seeing as that is what we are looking at this with, it would make sense to continue in a scientific vein... Nope. It's an emergent process. That was my side-point : life is emergent, and does not necessarily have a clear starting point, even if you can agree what ' life ' actually is in the first place. I've answered your questions, could you answer mine? To repeat it - what happens at the point of blastocyst implantation, and what makes that event so significant as to distinguish it from other ' turning points ' such as conception, birth or the development of the mental / nervous system?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>iangb : 1 ) Do you know what is a surrogate mother? 2 ) That is not a " noticable exception ". That cases are common even in my country. If parental duties exist towards an extrauterine child, why not towards an intrauterine child? When a blastocyst is implanted, organogenesis begins, a very active process starts. A blastocist may remain frozen, exactly as sperm. A human being is not only a clot of cells as morulla is. A human being has organs managed for a brain-nervous system. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>1 ) Again again, yup. But the baby is not biologically ' parasitic / symbiotic ' to the surrogate mother, just as ( after birth ) it is no longer biologically connected to the biological mother. 2 ) Do you have some evidence of this? I ask out of unrelated interest - it's not particularly relevant how rare the event is. The mother's body is kept ' alive ', despite her brain death. I'm still waiting for how there is a biological connection post-birth. Because the majority of the world does not have the same definition of ' child ' as you do. You're entitled to your opinion - but you have yet to show why your definition is the one that should be used. And when a child is born, it begins to breathe on it's own. And an implanted blastocyst does not have individual organs.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>iangb. Would you support that a surrogate mother would have the right to kill your loved daughter / son, despite your wife were crying because she loved that child? Even C section is so called due to Julio Cesar. In the past, often mothers died during delivery. Children were extracted by using that maneuver. Here in Mexico, cases when a mother died some hours ago but the baby was delivered alive were anecdotic in XXth century. Rub   n Le   ero, MD, performed that kind of surgeries. Even in recent times, that cases are commented sometimes in newspapers or TV. As medical science evolves, it is being more evident that the baby and the mother are two separate persons. Breas feeding. Remember it. Even artifitial incubators are an artifitial connection to an artifitial mother, in some sense. Are you saying that if the majority of the world say that Earth is flat, it is flat really? Do you know what is an argumentum ad populum? Are you saying that an adult connected to an artifitial respirator is " ethically murderable "? Do you know when spleen, liver, optical nerve, etc., are formed? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Again? How is this related? By the time my ' daughter / son ' was in a state where they could be ' killed ', no surrogate mother would have the right to end their life. If a child is not breast fed, what does this then make the child in your eyes? I don't really think I need to add to this particular contradiction of yours. In some cases, absolutely. It happens all the time. In every case - of course not. The difference, however, is that an adult on a ventilator has already had a mental existence. In the case of abortion, this isn't the case - you're not ' taking away ' because there is nothing to take in the first place. Significantly after blastocyst insertion.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Regarding the terminology of " baby " versus " zygote " / " embryo " / " fetus ", I wonder how many ultrasound technicians that say " oh, there's your embryro! " or " oh, look, your fetus is moving around! ". Or how many people come up to expecting mothers asking " when is your fetus due? " Probably not many. No, as a rule, people tend to call it a ' baby ', and with good reason -- as a rule, terminology reflects that people obviously tend to value life, and don't just refer to it only in sterile, clinical terms.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Once again, you can call it a Rotweiller of you wish. The only thing that matters is what the pregnant woman calls it. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yeah, and we all know pro-choice people always ask every pregnant woman before referring to it, " now what would YOU like your fetus / baby / whatever called? "<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Whatever!! It's still none of anyone's business except the pregnant woman. If you want the law to say she must to carry her fetus to term, I want the law to say that each and every profetallifer must adopt the " child " she / he " saves. " DEAL?? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Have you stopped to think about how silly that request is? That's like saying that, if a person opposes the death penalty, they should personally turn their homes into prisons to cover the extra inmates. Or if they are for gun control and don't want people to be able to use a gun to defend themselves, they should personally be a bodyguard for every person who would ever need a gun. Is that really the way you want to approach debates like this in society? These are broad society debates, and people should be able to discuss this sort of thing without those sorts of silly approaches.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Translation : Don't bother me ; I'm only concerned with the " unborn ". What happens to the little brats after birth in none of my concern. Too bad that the best analogy you can supply is a prisoner. The issue, no matter how far you try to shift the goalposts, is using the law to foist a prticular POV on others. Don't like it when you gander is sauced, do you? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Ooh yeah, that's it. Boy you sure nailed it. Sauced everybody's gander. ( Actually no, you completely missed the point. )<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Yes, yes, yes, and.................. yes!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You claim to have researched the facts... but I don't see any " facts " in your post. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Then you show a typical reaction to truth clashing with your worldview. Blindness. Have I seen an abortion performed?........ Yes. Fact. Do I believe it is OK?............................ Yes. Fact. Have I researched the facts?.................. Yes. Fact. Do I think the choice is the woman's?....... Yes. Fact. How many facts do you need?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That what I asked you. When I ask " What are the facts? ", you don't say " I've researched the facts ". You tell me the " facts ". <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You asked me nothing, you made a statement. " You claim to have researched the facts... but I don't see any " facts " in your post. " I spelled out the facts you overlooked, which were present in my post.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>My God, you're oblivious. WHAT FACTS DID YOU RESEARCH? " Yes, yes, yes... " doesn't give any facts about abortion - just about what you've claimed to do.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Simone They will never get the fact that the question is whether we are going to become a society that imposes compulsory gestation and forced parturition on women. They will avoid that question at all costs.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Maybe because thats not the question. The question is, do we get to rank humans as " worthy to live " and " not worthy to live ". I say no. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Am I psychic or what! Didn    t I predict that there would be those who would avoid my question? Am I good or what!<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The pro-choicers avoid the real question of abortion which is Why do dogs eat fruit loops on Wednesdays. The pro-choicers always avoid this question which is KEY to the abortion debate. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Glad to hear from you Steeeeve, and thanks for your typical intelligent response.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>AVOIDING THE QUESTION!!! I KNEW IT!! " Am I psychic or what! Didn    t I predict that there would be those who would avoid my question? Am I good or what! "<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The DNA of the egg is the same at the mother. The sperm is the same as the father. People can't replicate DNA different then theirs. A fetus is a separate being from the mother replicating its own. It's just feeding off of the mother.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>No they are'nt. DNA of gametes is haploid, where as the stomatic cells of the mother and father are diploid. Also, egg and sperm DNA is jumbled, meaning it genes are swapped along chromsosomes, resulting in very different combinations then exist in the original stomatic cells. No, you're wrong, the DNA of the egg and father have many of the same genes as the mother and father, but lack 1/2 of the same genes as well as the same placement. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I think you confused yourself. You more supported my argument than hurt it.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Because..... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>you said that the fetus ahs different DNA than the parents. It's not exactly the same as either parent. My point exactly, it's a unique entity.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>what? you were stating the that DNA of the egg and sperm was the same as the parent. Now you're just making things up. I didn't talk about fetus DNA. I talked about gamete DNA. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I was referring to the egg both as unfertilized and fertilized.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>this is not the forum to be debating religion... I believe the topic is religion and abortion.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You are right, it's a bit off topic but I couldn't resist. However, in my defense, these quotes are about women's value in the eyes of Christianity. A perfectly valid point in response to the topic of " Religions and Abortion ", since women and abortion are linked up. I guess if you're a 100% percent Christian and believe in 100% of the Bible, women don't even get a choice in regards to anything... including abortion. Their husbands decide. So it's no longer ' A Woman's Right to Choose '. It's about ' A Man's Right to Choose for His Woman '. Gee, that's a completely nonbiased site. I can find others who argue the other way around, but I try to avoid that b / c it just creates pointless debate. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just a generalized question so I clearly understand something... Exodus is Old Testament.. and Christian's don't believe in practicing Old Testament laws anymore b / c of Jesus, right? I mean, you eat pork, don't kill kids for misbehaving, that sort of thing? So, uh, I guess that that passage from Exodus and any representation from it could be thrown out the window? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>the site is fine... you can look up the hebrew words if you like and try to disprove him. Still a different discussion... although I suggest you read the whole Bible before you critize certain passages.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The Bible is a piece of fiction. There's no disproving or proving anything. Hey, I didn't criticize anything... I just quoted stuff right out of it. Reality hurts, eh? :p But are you saying that within the entire context of the Bible the passages pertaining to women's inferiority to men makes sense? Or are you one of those who picks and chooses which passages to live by, as you mentioned earlier. Please don't make assumptions about my reading habits. Ask first. I know it's a different discussion than this thread originally started in but I don't know where to reply to your posts about this but here. I apologize. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Can you repost this here - > http://www.4forums.com/political/religion-debates/ Reality is fine. Once again direct these comments to the link above.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You took the easy way out. :( No one else has posted here in a couple days, why not respond? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>No, I took the " stay on topic " way out. If you wish to refute the Bible or talk about its teachings then do so in the correct area.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Me, adopt children, and would you have them starve to death, I'm too young. Those " scribblings " are the basis of English Common Law, only an illiterate dolt wouldn't know that. Stop repeating yourself like a broken record, " why should a bureaucrat / government decide, " for the final time, it isn't a woman's right to determine when to murder children. If the woman didn't want children at that moment, don't have sex or adopt it out, there are waiting lists to get children, not the other way around. P.S. When I do grow older I may adopt children, depending upon my circumstances, if not then maybe I'll help their lives in other ways.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I'll find the Ten Commandments ( any one of the many versions ) in English Common Law? Really? Show me. Who are you to determine whether abortion is murder? The " don't have sex " argument is a bit tardy if she's already pregnant, isn't it? I'll counter the tardy objection with : she could use birth control. Why didn't you mention this option? I bet you're opposed to that, aren't you? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Y'all keep repeating the same arguments over and over, I've already refuted them. I guess it is true that you can lead a camel to water but you can't make him take a drink. I wouldn't be defining murder, my elected officials would be, and defining what constitutes any crime is and what the punishment should be is one of the primary purposes of government. I'm not responding unless you come up with something new.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That's not water, that's a mirage of wishful thinking. I'm quite happy not gulping down buckets of sand. You should try it sometime. You've refuted nothing. You say your beliefs come from the Bible. I show that your beliefs are contradicted by the Bible. Your response is as vacuous as your position, and then you ignore my subsequent comments. You get pro-abortion Bible quotes thrown at you every day? Why have you no response for that? Why have you no response to the question of where Jesus / God rescinded this law? Why do you not answer the questions of why, if it is none of your business, you make it your business? Why don't you respond to my question of whether you are against contraception? The answer is : you have no answer. You have your beliefs, which have been pounded into your brain in such a way that you truly believe that the Bible backs you up. It doesn't. Perhaps you think you're a good Christian. Do you stone people who work on the sabbath? Do you punish smart-mouthed offspring with death? Do you pray only in your closet? If not, you're not a good enough Christian. Read the Bible. It'll surprise you. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Jesus said himself " let who has not sin cast the first stone " when referring to an adulterous woman so you're the one who forgot to read the new testament. Say what verse promotes abortion.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So you think I'm an adulterous woman? Is that the best you can come up with? I did, except that I left out the book and chapter : Hosea 13. Or at least, this shows that God causes abortions. If you want promotion of abortion, try Numbers 5 : And, in case you wanted Biblical confirmation that a fetus is not regarded as a life, here's Exodus 21 : In a world where the law is life for life, when the woman is caused to miscarry but not otherwise injured, the guilty party merely pays a fine. But you're still not supporting your points. Can you show where this pro-abortion law is rescinded by Jesus? Hmmm? Can you answer any of the other questions you've been posed? Or will you just keep running away and calling me names? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>First, the second one says there is punishment for merely for causing infertility, hardly promoting abortion. The first one, if the woman is guilty, she becomes infertile, which was the punishment since Genesis for women who committed adultery, hardly promoting abortion. Moreover it shows that the Hebrews were unique in their love of children in the ancient world.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Oops. Willow didn't log off. That last post was mine. Sorry.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Willow and Nurglitch share the same computer? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No, we each have our own, but something we use each other's computers. I hope you're monogamous, because otherwise you're not only having risky unprotected sex, but you're being a risky partner yourself. Gays having unprotected sex with monogamous parters is as risky as straights having unprotected sex with monogamous partners, none.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I've had the same partner for 3 decades. I cal her " my wife ". Not true. Gay men use an orifice that is teeming with germs that I don't. They're far more likely to get an STD than a straight man and woman in a monogomous relationship EVEN if the relationship is also monogomous. Facts IS facts. :) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Good to hear. This may surprise you but not all gay sex is anal sex. There's also oral sex and mutual masturbation. Secondly unless you're into scat, which seems to be another fetish that doesn't respect gay / straight boundaries, you should be clean as a whistle down there. So I'm rather curious as to what you claim that I can get from sex with another man that I can't get from sex with a woman, in terms of sexually transmitted diseases. I don't really see how you can object to homosexuality on grounds of sexual acts, considering that a man and a woman can do pretty much everything two men or two women can do together. In that case you're not objecting to homosexuality but rather to particular sex acts.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Without getting graphic, what about the inside? Are you telling me that you're clean as a whistle inside as well? lymphogranuloma venereum ( LGV ), GBS, to name a couple. My personal objection to homosexuality is based on my religious beliefs AND health concerns. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Yeah, pretty much. Reading Dan Savage's sex-advice column was how I found out that some people sometimes experience something called ' santorum ', a frothy mix of lube and fecal matter, as a byproduct of anal sex. Can't say I've ever had that happen to me and I can imagine that people who experience it should probably clean themselves more carefully, change their diet, and remember to relieve themselves at least an hour before engaging in anal play. This may surprise you, but you can get LGV from opposite sex partners, especially in the tropics. Likewise so-called " gay bowel syndrome ", GBS, is merely a collection of infections that you can also get from opposite sex partners such Shigella, Giardia, Campylobacter-like organisms, Entamoeba, Chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis. So, do you actually know any STDs that are exclusive to homosexuals? Except that there are no particular health concerns that gay people have that straight people don't share, and your religious beliefs are your own which you have no legal or moral right to force others to hold.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>On that note, I think that I'll gracefully bow out of this discussion before I toss my dinner. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>So you're unable to discuss health concerns about particular sex acts, and therefore unable to back up your claims about the health impact of gay sex? I think it's really important to be able to discuss these things in a mature and adult fashion, especially when someone makes claims about them. So far I've pointed out that anal sex is neither restricted to gays, nor the primary sex act of gays, nor as unhygenic as has been claimed. However I would still like to hear about what STDs you think are exclusive to homosexuals, given that neither LGV or " GBS " are.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Like I had said, it is not anyone else's choice but that of the woman. Any other opinion is irrelevant. I remember a case which brought up that very question. It was around 20 years or so ago a woman, in Quebec, wanted to get an abortion but her boyfriend didn't want her to so she took him to court to decide the issue. While waiting for the case to come up there was a news conference with the two of them there. When the boyfriend was asked what he thought. He said something like, " My woman, my baby.. " I think that he lost the case because of that answer.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why is it irrelevant? Because you say so. Are you a woman? If not, then your opinion on this issue is irrelevant also! So? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>As is your opinion as well. She isn't his property and until men can get pregnant as well their only part is as a donor of some genetic material.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Only according to you. Therefore you've excluded from yourself the right to enter into this debate. I haven't. I look forward to not hearing from you again on this matter. :) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Wrong. You don't have a right to tell another person what to do with their body if they are of legal age. To do so would be little more than slavery.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So, you're allowing me the right to comment on the pregnancies of minors? I should ask you to stop before you reply and actually plan what you're going to say, because sometimes I get the impression what you say is not what you mean.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I missed this little remark before. It? s true there is some hypocrisy in America just like there is in all countries. But America has also done many good things for the world in general.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Like what? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Well probably the biggest thing was stopping fascism during WWII<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Err... I think you'll find that the Soviets had a role in that. Sorry that you've got the John Wayne history book open. LOL <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Hey you used some humor. Way to go montalban! A lot of countries had something to do with it. Even Australia contributed some cheerleaders. However the fact is that Germany and her allies were winning the war when the US entered and everybody knows if the US hadn't gotten involved they would have won.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No it wasn't meant to be funny, it was meant to be sarcastic. Obviously putting LOL changes the whole context of things for you... like a signpost. Yes, an off-the-cuff belittleing is what you're good at " cheerleaders " thanks for that. My grand-father fought in WWII. At least you didn't use the ' bullet-sponges ' insult. Everybody knows? Thank God for the USA. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I know it was sarcasm montalban. But sarcasm can be funny. I was being sarcastic back but you obviously didn    t get it. Lighten up. Thank you montalban. I knew that would get your goat. LOL I don    t know what the    bullet-sponges   insult is. On a serious note, I have all the respect in the world for WWII veterans. I had family that was killed during that war.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>sar   casm ** * P***Pronunciation Key** ( s   rkzm ) n. A cutting, often ironic remark intended to wound. A form of wit that is marked by the use of sarcastic language and is intended to make its victim the butt of contempt or ridicule. The use of sarcasm. See Synonyms at wit 1. http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=sarcasm You're all over the place with meanings of words. You think you show respect for WWII vets, but are quite happy to use sarcasm against Australian vets. Sarcasm might be funny to you, but it's not a device used to include all parties in the joke. It's funny to you, because you're the one dishing out the insults.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Wrong. Murder is the unlawful killing of a person.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I    m not quite clear on what you have said. Are you saying that the killing of slaves was not murder? Also what do you mean when you say the law? In other words, what law are you talking about? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Of course it was murder, by the intent of Constitution. Keeping slaves in the first place was a violation of it. If you can't figure it out why should I tell you. You should have seen it by the context of what I've been saying all along.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Seems like we    ve debated this point before. The one where you told me slaves were illegal because    All men are created equal    was in the constitution and I pointed out to you that it was not in the constitution but that the constitution specifically addressed how to count slaves in determining representation and left slavery laws to the individual states. In addition court cases clearly showed that slavery was legal. Since slaves were definitely legal property, it was legal to kill them. Oh I can figure it out all right. If you address the subject you will be backed into a corner you can    t get out of except by brushing it off as irrelevant. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>They were breaking the intent of their own laws. Either their laws apply to all or they apply to none. There was much hypocrisy in early American and there is still some today. If you had figured it out then why did you ask?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>What law are you talking about when you say    intent of their own laws   ? I haven    t seen a law that gave slaves any rights when our country was founded. I    ve seen several that denied them rights. So where was the intent? Don    t know where you came up with that as they obviously did apply to some and not to all. In our country the courts interpret the meaning of a law in case there is any doubt. Just look at the court decisions. Didn    t you read my post? I wanted you to back yourself into a corner. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Redundant discussion.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Good, then I'll take that as a concession that you believe killing slaves was not murder since it was legal. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>What you haven't realized is that when they freed the slaves and gave women the right to choose they were correcting two old errors.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Since we were correcting a wrong, you must believe that even though it was legal to kill slaves, it was morally wrong because they were human beings, right? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Still met the legal definition as well, even if they choose to ignore it.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>I don't understand what you just said. Are you saying it was legal to kill slaves or it was not legal to kill slaves even though the law said you could? <br><b>S1:7-  </b>The law stating the slaves were not human violated the intent of the Constitution and Bill of Rights so it was invalid.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>You have made a statement that you are claiming is a fact. I am waiting for you to show me some statement in our Constitution or our Bill of Rights that shows the intent of our Constitution or our Bill of Rights made state laws regarding the killing of slaves as void. Without you pointing out some phrase that shows that intent, it is obvious that you will concede the point. And if it    s there, it should be very easy to do since it is a short document.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>* sighs* You'll just get me upset with you, and that's no use. We don't agree, and there isn't much else to say right now.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Because I won't give you the answers you want to hear? :) Like I had said, no is telling women to have an abortion here. We're just protecting your reproductive rights, you really haven't had them all that long. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I don't want you to protect such reproductive rights! I'm getting annoyed at you as a person, and that's not good. Therefore, since you have your mind set and you have your way of debating, I more or less had enough arguing when it goes no where. :)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You want to be nothing more than property, again? With no say at all about your own body? Amazing. It's not my fault that you don't realize what you want to give up. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If that's the way you insist upon putting it, sure. But that's not at all what I mean, and abortion being legal does not equal women being property. Are you saying that I'm giving up my rights to my body, or that I'm giving up a wonderful conversation with you? ;)<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But abortion being illegal does. If you don't have a say in you own reproductive rights as an adult than you're no different than livestock. Both. :) <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Sorry, I meant if abortion was illegal. So abortion being illegal would reduce me to being as low as livestock??! Pardon me, but where on earth do you get these ideas? lol! I don't know if I like you or not. Just beware. I can get annoyed sometimes ;) Okay, bring it on. ( remember, I'm stubborn too, and I believe what I say on abortion all the way. )<br><b> S2:4-  </b>It was what you would have been thought of as when women didn't have a say in their own bodies, though the actual livestock had more value to the farmer. If you want to choose to negate your rights that is your choice, but you can't decide for other women either. This may be a too personal question, but do you have sex? If so are you willing to not have sex unless it is to have a baby? Since sex is only for reproduction according to many Christians and birth control is a sin. What would you do if after they managed to outlaw abortions they next worked to outlaw pre-marital sex again as well, what they use to call fornication? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I don't care what I would have been thought as, we are past that time in life, and banning abortion will NOT bring that time back. Besides, whose fault would it be if that time did come back? Not the woman's fault. No, she's not the one treating herself like livestock, it's the man. For the first thing, what if the majority ruled against abortion? Three things : No, I don't have sex. Who said I'm a Christian? And no, the Christians who think that sex is only for reproduction are wrong. I don't think most Christians think that way at all. You were raised ( or got your beliefs elsewhere somehow ) with some weird ideas, you know?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Remember, these are the people who want to bring back the so-called " good old days ". well that was what they were like, when only men had any real rights and freedoms, and mostly if they were white and of the " proper " belief as well. As to your second point, exactly. Then the so-called " Good old days " will come back as well and it would mean that the USA is degrading. Who are you to say that since to them you're only a woman. I was raised in an environment of traditional Christian values. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Just how long ago are you talking with the " good old days, " anyway? Also, legalizing abortion has nothing to do with whites and blacks and other races of humans. It also has nothing to do with the equality of women and men now. Women aren't fighting in Iraq because abortion is legal. Women aren't senators and governors and in the Supreme Court because abortion is legal. All that didn't happen because abortion was illegal either. What about the women in the positions I listed who are pro-life? They aren't there just because men decided women have the right for abortions! Reeeeaaally, huh? As for as I know, the majority has the say in most things, and that doesn't mean that every time the majority rules against something that others don't like that everything is degrading. I didn't say I wasn't a Christian, did I? Which religion / church were you brought up in?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Back before women got the vote. To many of them things went down hill from there. :) Didn't say that it did. Yes, it does. Unless you have the right to choice all others will be next to go. When it involves the negation of a natural right than it is a degradation. Didn't say that you weren't either. That of the majority of Christians in the world. Roman Catholic. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>Things went downhill after they could vote?? Also, they could vote in 1920. 1920! That's back right after the " good old days "? You DO know that's a long time ago, and many things have changed since then, don't you. I certainly hope so. You had said something about " blacks " in your post. Abortion doesn't make men and women equal. Women started to vote before abortion was legal. We did have rights before then. Abortion is a natural right, huh? That's irrelevant. Just was curious. :) By the way, you had asked, " who is raised in a pro-death household, " in the thread I started. I want to reply on it here : I believe everyone who is pro-choice.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>It has taken much hard work over the years. Many of your rights have come about quite recently, though. When? Didn't say that it did, since it is solely a woman's right. Not as many as you've gotten since it became legal. The right to choose is. You brought it up. :) You would be quite wrong since it seems that most of those who are against abortions support the killing of persons instead.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>" WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court upheld the nationwide ban on a controversial abortion procedure Wednesday, handing abortion opponents the long-awaited victory they expected from a more conservative bench. The 5 - 4 ruling said the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act that Congress passed and President Bush signed into law in 2003 does not violate a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. The opponents of the act " have not demonstrated that the Act would be unconstitutional in a large fraction of relevant cases, " Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion. " http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070418/...59UoFloUOs0NUE It will interesting to see how quickly all these people here who have, at various times, said they aren't really for late term abortions will applaud this ruling.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>If the partial birth abortion procedure was only outlawed in the third trimester and if it allowed for the exceptions of risk to mother's life, health, etc., then it would be fine. However, reading your article, it doesn't look like the mother's health exception is being honored. Quoting from your link : The numbers of women for whom this procedure is the only viable one may be small, but I think exceptions need to be granted them if that is the only way for them to avoid serious health risks. Do you personally think that serious risk to women's health is not a viable exception to abortion restrictions? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>A lot of people have taken issue with " the woman's health " phrase as a caveat due to the fact it is so vague. I tend to think it is too vague to be reasonable. If specific standards were put in place as to determine at what point such a phrase is violated, then I might be more open to it. Because " health of the mother " could be so wide-open to interpretation, it would be an allowance for abortion that would basically have no meaning and significance. And that is, I think, one reason the pro-choice lobby wanted such phraseology. Yeah, I certainly think it's a good ruling. IMO there is no reason ( other than the life of the mother ) to do such a horrible thing to a late-term fetus.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I agree that the mother's health exception is vaguely worded and that vagueness can be a problem. Right now, it seems like we have a choice of two extremes - either grant the health exception for any health risk or don't grant it at all. Of those two extremes, I would rather err on the side of allowing it and let people's consciences decide. As to the idea of trying to narrow down that health risk exception, I had set up a thread specifically for that purpose. I, for one, thought that the health exception should cover severe health risks ( ex. of paralysis, severe heart trouble risking an early death, mental health risking suicide, etc. ) but not everyday health risks associated with normal pregnancies. It is the gray region in between that is tricky and I had opened that thread to hear people's opinions on it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Sorry I missed your thread on that. It sounds like you are mainly concerned with health issues that could very potentially lead to the mother's death and or / complete debilitation ( like paralysis ), and I'd be much more open to that. But as you said, we have two extremes to choose from, and SCOTUS chose the one that doesn't take into account the woman's health for this particular procedure. I'd also add that because this is a late term procedure, if health is the reason to not take the baby to term, then caesarian delivery very well might be an option, in many cases.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I agree that all other reasonably safe options ( such as caesarian delivery, in womb operations, etc. ) should be looked into before resorting to abortion in that third trimester. As with the example of the friend of jitobear, sometimes there is just not a reasonably safe option for a particular woman since her conditions might not allow those alternate procedures. As for the question of limits on the health exception, yes, the exceptions that are clearer to me are the ones that could ultimately lead to the mother's death or complete debilitation. However, there is also a gray region that I am undecided on. For example : - What if the pregnancy would lead to less critical loss - such as the loss of use of her legs or arms? What about one limb - such as the use of one arm? - What if the pregnancy would give a medium chance of loss - such as a 20% chance of paralysis? The gray region is harder to quantify and the moral balance gets trickier. Perhaps that is why this issue hasn't really been addressed specifically in law. Where decisions in morally gray regions are concerned, it is too easy to criticize them and politically unwise to venture into that territory. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>These are all very specific situations, and all ones that are something to think about. Crafting abortion law that would cover every conceivable circumstance would be very difficult and tedious, not to mention difficult to follow. I guess a vague statement is the only real option at all, and so I think it's always going to come down to deciding whether we want to simply include the " health of the mother " as a caveat or not. Personally, I think it's always going to be too vague, and there's really little that can be done about that.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>We also have the option of leaving it up to a judge who follows certain general guidelines or set up some loose guidelines that at least narrow that health exception down ( ex. limiting it to permanent damage, or permanent damage of a particular degree, etc. ). I just don't think that this issue has been addressed enough yet. Discussions on forums such as this could help narrow down that health exception definition.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>As I understand the procedure the child is delivered breech EXCEPT for the head and then a syringe is inserted into the base of the brain and suction applied. Can you tell me how the nearly full delivery, BREECH mind you, is safer than a normal delivery? Huck<br><b> S2:1-  </b>All fetuses are breech. The critter turns around at the very end. I don't know why it is, but when you look at the numbers, it ( intact dilatation and extraction ) has the lowest maternal mortality rate of all second trimester pregnancy termination procedures and comparable morbidity to other second trimester techniques* ( systemic and intrauterine abortefacients. ) What do you mean by normal delivery? This is an abortion, not delivery. What is your thinking on why it would not be safer? * Stubblefield, PG. Pregnancy termination. p. 1303. In : Obstetrics : Normal and Problem Pregnancies, 2nd ed, Gabbe, SG, Niebyl, JR, Simpson, JL ( eds ), Churchill Livingstone, New York 1991. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>My understanding of the procedure is that the fetus sometimes has to be turned into a breeach position in order to have this procedure occur. As far as safety goes, I am thinking if a baby has been delivered except for the head, the hard part would be over and the mother's life would not really be in MORE jeopardy than when the procedure began. I guess I have a hard time thinking that this particular procedure actually can put the mother in LESS risk. It seems to be far more risky than actual delivery given the descriptions that I have read ( not on anti abortion websites but form surgical journals etc. ) Huck<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The facts, it seems, belie these suppositions. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>which suppositions ( I made a couple of them ) and which facts are you talking about?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The medical facts. You supposed the E & D procedure would not be safer, based upon, well I'm not sure. But anyway, the numbers don't bear that out. It is has the lowest mortality rate of 2nd trimester procedures. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Is the procedure different than the one I described?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>That's why I said worthy. Not legally punishable with. The idea that this man will spend years in prison for a totally illogical crime disgusts me, whether its legal or not. If I said that someone taken to a death camp had done nothing worthy of death would you say that they did because that was the law? Everyone's well aware of the legal position, so that obviously wasn't my meaning. if you want to argue that breaking the law is itself an immorality worthy of a life sentence, go ahead.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I can't see where it disgusts you, unless you feel that committing, or assisting in the perpetration, of a crime is logical / illogical... Even though rationality should play some role in our actions, it has no precedence here. What was done was against the law ; murder. Should he be alone in this? No. She should be there with him.... be they from Texas or Riptarse, Tennessee. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It disgusts me because this man has killed something which the law recongnises may be killed, and he even had the permission of the mother. The idea of spending years in the hell that is American jail because of whatever stupid reason they didn't have a proper abortion is agonising and ridiculous. But what she did wasn't as Fox News admits. You can't say he should be in jail BECAUSE its the law and then ignore the law so you can put her there too. If she's done something wrong, then I see no moral difference to every other abortion. Would you put every mother who has an abortion and every doctor involved in jail? This is an unjust law because it does not tally with others.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Even though I see where you're coming from - feelings play no part in it. I would like to run the conduit and wire in our football stadium. I could do it, have the means, but I have no license. It would be against the National Electric Code and I could be fined for even installing a receptacle in public housing or commercial buildings. It's the rules. It is pure and simple murder, just as some abortions ( not all ) are themselves, pure and simple murder. But, I can't allow my feelings to go against the law. I can, however, change the law to fit my feelings if I have the means. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I can allow my feelings to go against the law. If I had means to allow this man to escape imprisonment I would use them. I think a moral duty overrides obedience to law. Which abortions are ' pure and simple murder ' BTW chloe : ' On what basis? ' Finish reading the sentance, please....<br><b> S2:3-  </b>And, once caught, be in there with him. I absolutely hate some of the laws, and like you ( once upon a time ) would fight the law, but soon figured out that the law does not discriminate and certainly couldn't care less about our feelings. Very noble gesture, but ill advised. Outsmart the law - that's better. The ones that are not are : Life and Death, Rape, Incest, Horrible Disease / Disorder... along those lines.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>For example ; you would never hear the police describe a ZEF as a ' person of interest ' - but they COULD describe the woman pregnant with the ZEF as a ' person of interest '. One is not born, one is. It is, and always has been common practice to use the word as such. See below :<br><b> S2:1-  </b>But you may hear the police describe a fetus as an unborn baby. They would never describe it as a parasite. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You seem to make a LOT of red herring statements whenever you reply. I hope you're keeping that frying pan clean. LOL<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You are and regularly do, the very thing that you accuse others. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Post the definition of what a red herring is. Then try to post one that I supposedly made ( start Jeopardy theme music ). Let's prove how prejudice you are. Put up or shut up gansao<br><b> S2:3-  </b>juvenile and pointless post but still typical. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Oh look, more gibberish. Amazing how you couldn't post the definition of what a red herring is, or show us any examples of what you claimed. No big surprise there. You seem to make a habit of using words that you don't know the definition of. Hmmm... wonder why? ;)<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Juvenile, pointless and typical are all apt words to describe your post. As far as finding a definition of red herring for you, that request is junenile, pointless and typical<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Do you respect anyone's opinions or authority onany subject, Steeeve?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I respect everyone's opinion no matter how wrong they may be :) With abortion you have a unique situation in that no person's opinion is above anyone elses because there is no human authority on the matter. Human's don't get to decide the value of other human's. You get value from an authority above you. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Steeeve where are you getting this value angle from? People have a right to their lives regardless of the value of that life as determined by others. Don't they? So, if a child is alive,.... no matter what stage of life, growth or development they are in,... they have a right to the life they are living. Don't they? I don't get this " value " angle. We have established that human beings have a right to their lives. A prebirth child is a human being So, a prebirth child should have a right to their life. The life that they are already living. Simple as that.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I argue that value comes from something higher than what is being valued. So for example, I can't decide your value is less than mine, have that be universally true, and therefore make you my slave. We have a history in this country of thinking we can place values on ourselves and we try to arbitrarily create a definition based upon your own criteria you are giving to yourself. It actually creates a circular argument because you assume you have authority to give yourself value but you'd have to have value to do so and it makes a big circle. They have the same rights your or I do. The DOI said it best.. right are endowed by our creator. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Right,... so tell me at what point ( I conclude that it's conception ) is it that those rights are endowed in a new person's life? Then tell me how to prove that point to others in a forum that stresses a separation ( that i agree with ) between church and state.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It is largely irrelevant because if you take my argument that we aren't able to determine value of humans to begin with than abortion is already out of the question. And a right to life can be taken away from the person that granted it. Separation of church and state is a bogus argument in my opinion. It has gotten to the point where if a certain issue has a majority ( not 100% ) support by a religion than you can't make it a law. This is a perversion of what Jefferson said and frankly if you read the rest of his work he didn't mean it to be more than the state to stay out of the churches business. He never meant, and no one meant, that you can't have a moral code from a religion and based upon that vote for or against moral laws. Abortion laws and separation of church and state are unrelated. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Ok,... I've read that twice really slow. I got nuthin from it. I don't disagree with your conclusion. I do think that the arguments against elective abortion can and should be made without a religious basis when it is being presented to people who are not interested in a religious perspective,... or who are actually offended by it. I for one oppose elective abortion. But I can not stand anyone getting in my face about religion, god or souls. But that's just me.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Does a human zygote have rights? Why stop there, why not ask if sperm and eggs have rights? What about human DNA does it has rights?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You can always ask, Accipter. Of course, you should be mindfull of the fact that extablishing the rights of gametes cells would also result in laws against elective abortion. So, While I get your sarcasm and see where you are going with your comments,.... You would not be doing the " pro-choice on elective abortion " movement any favors by taking it further than ' conception. ' Brief pause,.... " You know what, Accipiter,.... I think you should lead the way and demand human rights for human Gametes cells! " You can do it! <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I wouldn    t defend it because it's ridiculous. And now you are defending it.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Do you mean to say those scientists don't know what they are talking about? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>they have a right to an opinion.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Don't we all? Tell me Accipiter,... " when do you think a human individual's life biologically begins? "<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I believe there should be laws that only trained, licensed, medical professionals conduct abortions. I also would support that late pregnancy abortions only occur if a doctor deems them medically necesary. ( And I mean DOCTOR - not religious leaders or peckerwood politicians - a DOCTOR. )<br><b> S2:1-  </b>( Playing devil's advocate ) And, by what authority would you deny a woman's " right to choose " an abortion that happens to be " late in her pregnancy? " <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Thats a very good question. To be honest - I would prefer no legislation period - but I would not get up in arms about a late term restriction like I described because 1 ) a fetus could very well survive outside of the mom at that point, 2 ) most reputable doctors won't conduct an abortion at that stage without a legitimate medical reason anyway.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I see,... so ( to you ) it's not like the child has a right to it's life or anything like that. Thanks for the clarification. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I would like to state for the record that I am a woman. As long as it is in my body, not above and beyond my rights to my body, no. Come up with a reasonable argument that doesn't demonize women and trivialize the realities of pregnancy and I will respond. Abortion so the mother can take a vacation - frakkin #####... I am aware what pro-life advocates got presented to congress. I also know that there are doctors that disagree. Like I said - doctors decision - dependent on each case, not blanket decisions by peckerwood politicians ( who probably could not pass 8th grade biology if their life depended on it ).<br><b> S2:3-  </b>::: gasp ::: So, do you think a child has a right to their life from the moment their life begins? Or no? I really don't need for you to respond, Jitobear. You have made your positions clear and I am posting mine. The readers can ( and will ) decide for themselves which of our positions ( if any ) will give them cause to reflect or rethink their own positions. I think that's good enough for any forum,... isn't it? Interesting,... can you please tell me of any one situation where it is more beneficial for a woman's physical health to remove her baby from her DEAD by way of the procedure known as " partial birth abortion " as opposed to surgically removing the baby alive? Please be clear on how killing the child is more of a benefit to the mother than delivering it alive would be. ( waiting patiently ) <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Somebody called me " he " - just wanted to clarify. I already answered this. That was directed at Cyberateos - not you. Yep My understanding is that late term aLate term abortion is extremely rare and generally done to remove a fetus that is not viable. I have a friend who has a serious heart condition that makes any kind of surgery extremely risky. She is a mother of two - it would be ludicrous for her to undergo a surgery that could kill her so as to not perform a D & E to remove fetus that isn't viable. Just one story there. But I am not a doctor, nor ( I suspect ) are you. As I said - leave it to them.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>So far the medical community is remiss in providing even one case where a " partial birth " abortion has any advantage over any other procedure. Not even in cases such as the one you described. You have to understand the procedure itself to understand why that is. The baby is pulled out of the womb " breech. " It is turned in the womb to accomplish this. It also has to be turned so that it is " face down " ( so the dr. can later poke a hole in the base of his / her skull and suck out the brain. ) Forced breech birth of all but the head,... Not much healthy for an already traumatized mom. It's no less traumatic than delivering the baby alive. However! ( and just in case you didn't know ) There is in fact a " life of the mother exception. " It's just never going to be put to the test because the procedure itself is simply that barbaric and un-necessary for the health of the mother to be affectively addressed using other ( less traumatic ) means.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I'm not quite sure how you come up with that point since most Americans are Christian and more than half of Americans are pro-choice. I suspect that you are creating a circular definition here - i.e. A Christian is, by your definition, one that is pro-life. If you like circular definitions, then so be it, but your definition would be ignored as illogical by the large percentage of Christians that ARE pro-choice, as well as by myself.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Such is the beliefs of not only Esdraelon,... but seemingly a large number of those who find elective abortion as an affront to their religious doctrine. The reactions to your comments should have been expected, Esdraelon. Were they? I wonder if you would consider reading my views on religion and politics ( posted here ) and maybe telling me what you think. As for a response to your other responders? I have linked to a post which shows my own outrage with ESD's remarks above,.... But I also have to ask what seems to me to be an obvious question ; " How can you so seriously feign being outraged at Esd's " playing God " and appointing him / herself as the final say in who is and who is not a " Christian? " Even as you yourselves take on that role as you deny the status of " personhood " to pre-birth children? " I disagree with Esd's comments as much as you guys do,... but at least no-one is killed or denied their basic rights as a result of His / Her denials. The same can not be said for yours. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Heck, if the fetus considers him / herself a person, then he is a person in my eyes! Of course, he would need a mind to be able to consider him / herself a person...<br><b> S2:2-  </b>-- God So much for arguing for someone else's rights by proxy, huh. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>YOU were the one making the comparison to whether or not people can consider themselves Christian despite being pro-choice. It was simply a logical extention of that comparison. Of course, my own view of personhood doesn't require a mind to be as advanced as would be needed to recognize itself as a person. I just require ANY human mind - no matter how rudimentary - to logically see a living entity as a person.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>" I just require " = " God wannabe " <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Each of us - both you and I included - have the right to our own views based on what we have found to be logical. Obviously, you and I disagree on the definition of person. That doesn't mean that either of us is " playing God " by holding that opinion. We could only be accused of playing God if we expected everyone else to agree with us because of an inherent feeling of superiority instead of through force of arguement. I always present my arguements and defend them point by point without running away from an uncomfortable point. That is not playing God. That is simply the process of engaging in debate. Do you think that people do not have the right to their own opinion? If so, then you are living in the wrong country.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No AO, I agree with the definition of " person " as it applies to pre-birth children. If I had the time I would link to them yet again. You are the one who places a higher standard ( brain activity ) that is not a requirment of the definition " human being. " So it is in that respect that YOU are playing God. A human fetus is BY DEFINITION a " human individual being. " There is no requirment in the definition for an ability to think or feel pain. Gotta go,.. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>We've already had these discussions on semantics in another thread and they have led nowhere so I have no desire to repeat them over again. Readers can judge each of our arguements on this subject for themselves by reading those earlier threads.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Semantics? While I take offense at your claiming we are only arguing semantics ; I do agree with you on one thing... Readers should read the earlier threads. Words have definitive meanings. Human, being, person, begin, etc. Each reader who truly cares about the issue should take the time an avail themselves of all the sources for information they can find, and educate themselves on what the meanings of those words are, and how those words apply to the beginnings of a new child's life and their right to the life they are living. Can we at least agree on that much? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>As people who know how to use dictionaries realize, words have multiple meanings where you have to look up the meaning most suitable to the context in which you are trying to use the word. These are basic concepts known by most people starting in early school years that you often fail to grasp, as shown by your posts. Your posts have shown that, first, you try to force the definition from one context to apply to another context and, second, you fail to fully defend your interpretation of the definition. Readers will be able to judge for themselves...<br><b> S2:6-  </b>The words mean what they mean. The facts are what they are. I think we both agree on that and I'm hoping you have no problem with encouraging others to educate themselves on what the facts are.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I keep hearing you claim that the government has no " right " to use someone's body against their will, but you're argument is patently false. The government can and does use people's bodies against their will, it's called the military draft. Hundreds of thousands of men were forced into military service, so don't claim that the government can't " use someone's body against their will ". It can.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Quite frankly I do not approve of the draft either. But aren't there recourses and exceptions that can be made? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>A few, just as there are exceptions for abortions that threaten the life of the mother. :)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Health and rape. I will fight hard and mean against lifers until they can meet in the middle where women are valued a little earlier than the verge of death. Plus I know you don't support helping those in need and complain about bleeding heart liberals who do. " Be pregnant, have baby, ( unless your gonna die ), but don't actually expect me to care if it starves. I can meddle with your body - but you need to stay the hell out of my wallet. " <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I would have no problem with those stipulations if I knew that they weren't already being abused. If you changed it to " the life of the mother " instead of " health ", I'd agree. But you and I both know that there are plenty of abortion doctors out there who are more than happy to justify abortions based on the " mental health and wel-being " of the mother. That nebulous term is an invitation to abuse, IMO. Quite the contrary, I believe highly in helping those in need. That's what CHARITY is for, NOT government. That's my beef. Uncle Sam shouldn't be in the charity business. Between you and me, want to wager who gives more money to help the needy? I hear you spout liberal dogma all of the time, but do YOU put your money where YOUR mouth is? I DO.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Go to hell. You will neve value women and we will never agree. Balls. It would go back to everyone working for the king ( s ) and nobody giving a damn for the poor. Why not? I donate to several organizations, have worked in homeless sheltered, have volunteered my time to lead activites for the mentally ill. I give money to my family when they need it. Sponsor other kids on school field trips, when their parents can't afford to. And on top of that - I don't whine about my tax dollars going to help those in need. Conservatives seem to think that they are the only ones that pay taxes. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I value women enough to still be married to one for 26 + years and still going strong. I've raised two intelligent, independent daughters. I'll let my actions speak for themselves. My bad. I forgot for a second that you were a true liberal that believed that Uncle Sam knew what to do with YOUR money better than YOU did. Isn't it great that Uncle Sam gets to chose YOUR charities so that you don't have to do any thinking on your own. :) How refreshing, a liberal that actually does something other than talk. Considering that the top 50% of wage earners ( majority are Republican ) pay 96% of all income taxes, you're not far from wrong. :p But that's not the point. The Federal Gov't has no business being in the business of charity. Charity should NEVER be coerced. It should be freely given to those charities that the donor deems worthy. Your problem is that if Uncle Sam wasn't in the business of charity, your left wing social engineering programs wouldn't get any funding because nobody with money to give would find them worthy enough to receive any support.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Precisely, if a master craftsman destroys his finest creation because it is flawed, is he doing something wrong? Or isn't it his right to do what he wishes with his creation. So it is with the maker of all that is. So they may seem like terrible acts from your VERY LIMITED PERSPECTIVE, but from the perspective of a perfect and holy God, His judgement was a righteous one on all levels. But why would one expect you to get that?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>If your god were to ' destroy his creations ' because they are ' flawed ', how come any one of us is still here? Smiley <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Because God is free to show grace to some and judgement to others. It is what makes Him God and we can't begin to understand His perspective. He is not obliged to explain His eternal perspective to us at all.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If we cannot begin to understand his perspective ( or indeed him ), how can you possibly claim to understand him any better than the rest of us? Smiley <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I don't claim to understand the mind of God, but He has revealed His nature to us in His word. So although I don't understand why He chose to reveal Himself to me on a personal level and not others, I know through His Word that it is His right to have done it. Rom 9:21 Does not the potter have power over the clay, from the same lump to make one vessel for honor and another for dishonor?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're always claiming to understand him. It is just we the spiritually dead than cannot possibly understand him. You claim to be indwelled by the holy spirit ( probably means you've drunk to much ). If your god is so all powerful, omniscient, unfathomable, etc etc etc ( a claim that is all too often made by your ilk ), then there is not a chance in hell that any mere mortal could come close to understand him / her / it. How you can say that you are any closer to the real god than muslims, shintoists, zoroastrianists, yoruba is pure idiocy. Smiley PS Your scripture quote is just an excuse for those in power to say that whatever they decide to do is god's will and should not be questioned. Seems you're gullible enough to fall for that one too. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I'm sorry for you smiley. I really am. I can't help it that you are blind and deaf to the things of God, and that as worthless as I am, that I have a personal relationship with Him. But I can tell you this for certain, even though I am no more worthy than any other person alive ; because I sought THE TRUTH as a young person, and not just my personal truth as you did, that the living God responded to my sincere search by revealing Himself to me. So I am born again by grace through faith in Him who died for my sins. Just think about those words as you scoff and mock me for the ignorance I reveal in your sight by admitting that I am submitting the authority over my life to an invisible God. The reason you don't get it smiley is the difference between eternal death and eternal life. And the time to decide which of us is being deceived is now, in this lifetime.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Don't worry, Archie. I feel sorry for you too. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Thanks for your concern. As misplaced as it is, I truly appreciate it.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Back in the day, no one even thought of abortion. They would go thru with it even if the mother was going to die. I believe that the mother has a right to decide if she could die from the birth or if it was the case of incest. NOT OTHERWISE!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Ah, back in the day. I get misty eyed when I think of back then. Trading horses for wives... no antibiotics... poor nutrition... having 10 kids so 2 live to adulthood. Ah, the memories :D Fallacy. Just because it's an old idea does not make it a good idea. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Your right. Some things back then weren't okay but it was better than the society we live in today where everyone is killing each off and robbing each other and instead of letting people live after they've been raped they kill them!<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That is totally, completely and entirely opinion. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It's truth. Period. What? you think that today's society is better? Prove it!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You think that today's society is worse? Um... prove it? :p There is no ' proof ' that society is better or worse. There are good things and bad things about every aspect of any society. Once we live in Utopia we can talk about being in a perfect society ;) Every era thinks that the previous era was a mythical ' Golden Age ' when the truth is that when it was that time, they thought the previous era was the ' Golden Age ' as well. I can guarantee you that the people during your ' Golden Age ' probably thought there were problems too.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Well, you ARE the one advocating the murder of physicians.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And that would make you the one that IS advocating the murder of our future generation. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Your lie about me is duly noted.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Which lie is that? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>That would be your outright lie that I advocate murder of anybody.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I don't partake in your word play games. So lets call it like it is. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Yes, we have already called it to be your lies. Nothing more to add.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Hey, I am all for the right to murder an unborn child. Someday I may choose to due just that. I am also for calling like it is. If your technical terms help you justify the process then you are hiding from the way that you truely feel. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Really? You are supporting illegal killings? Well, to each their own. Good, then you are all for not calling abortion " murder " ( funny though, as you just did that. That must have been an oversight of yours, then ) and thus is not supportive of the anti-choice revisionist linguistics. That's encouraging ; that you are going to change your ways from calling things what they are not. Eh? What gave you that idea? My support for the right of women to chose what happens to their own bodies rather than have fundie misogynists enslave them, that has nothing to do with technical language. Your outright lies about me, though, does have something to do with your recent use of revisionist linguistics. It is encouraging, though, that you now have forsaken that silly approacha and will deal with reality instead. Given your false premise to begin with, I am sure you can see the error of your claim. :)<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Your post was fine until you started into the " demonizing " bit. Why did you feel the need to get in that dig? It's sad that the pro-choice movement has resorted to portraying a desire to protect the life of the unborn as " demonizing " women. Intellectual dishonesty.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Perhaps not demonizing them, if castigating women who choose to abort as selfish or immoral is not demonizing. But, favoring fertilized eggs, embryos and fetuses over women certainly reduces greatly the humanity of the female sex. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>What you don't seem to understand is that we would have far more women in the world today if it weren't for abortion. There are far less women in the world today because of it than there would be women as mothers who would die or are seriously injured in childbirth. So in that sense, abortion is very anti-woman. It's anti-humanity.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Obviously, you don't think it inhumane to strangle a baby at birth because it is female, as is done in many patriarchal cultures where women are despised. Or, exposed to wild beasts in the forest, as often happened in the old Roman empire. Or, abandoned to an orphanage and the great neglect that resides there, as still happens in China, where women and girls still are not valued as they should be. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Of COURSE I consider that inhumane. Why would you say something like that?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>One does wonder because of what you say. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>What did I say, specifically, that gives you the idea I would it inhumane to strangle a newborn??? Are you out of your mind?? If you are going to make such reckless and inflammatory accusations, I'm going to hold your feet to the fire and expect you to back them up.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I was an embryo, I have a point of view.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Then please do tell us what the first trimester was like. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It was like yours.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Then you have no memory of it. Your nervous system was not developed enough to generate pain signals... and there was no brain there to interpret the signals as pain. You had no thoughts. You were nothing more than a lump developing slowly into a mammal to be born when ready. You were a burden to your mother. You hadn't the ability nor the knowledge to protest an abortion or to beg for your life for you had no brain with which to think about ANYTHING. You had no point of view. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I still have a point of view.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>As does every person alive... it has NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with the fact that each was once an embryo. You have a point of view because you survived the embryonic stage. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I don't disagree with that.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>With no idea how or why he came about, he trusts in his mummy it will all be sorted out. From time to time a tune will be played, it's only his mother humming away. It is like being in space and bouncing around, especially when mum is running up and down. But it is all cut short one bad day, a bladed catheter sliced me away. First it ripped and severed my leg, then it punctured my guts, removed them today. The jabbing and slicing makes me feel bad, I wonder why mummy is making me sad? I never got the chance to see her face, now I'm dismembered all over the place. I will never know her or see her, not a trace, I have been removed from the human race. Want to cuddle and give her a kiss, and say hi to my brothers I know I will miss.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The only reason why that makes no sense is that no one exists inside the embryo. It would be like writing about someone weeding their garden from a weeds point of view. The anthropomorphization of non-mental existant beings is implausible at least. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I never claimed anyone did live inside an embryo.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well, you're writing from an embryo's point of view, when an embryo doesn't even have a point of view. It would be like writing from a rock's point of view. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I was an embryo, I have a point of view.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Your flesh was an embryo, what we know as " you " or who is typing that, came to exist somewhere in the third trimester. Besides, I used to be a sperm, that doesn't mean sperm have points of views.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Anti-Abortionists want to deal with a " moral issue ". Someone else's babies and children aren't involved with that issue. Simply a by-product.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>How is abortion not a moral issue? Murder is a " moral " issue as well.. same with theft... etc. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Remember where you are. This is the " What ' gets ' me thread ". Abortion IS a moral issue. But that's all it is to anti-abortionists. Pro-Choice people realize that the decision carries the weight of raising the child or not.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>hmmm, I think the weight of raising a child is a moral issue as well. To say that pro-life people don't think about this is ignorant ( not that you are... cause I don't think you are ). It is hard to worry about raising a child that is killed though. First you gotta let the child live, then worry about how to raise it. Ok, but you can't claim most since you haven't met everyone on the planet. Did you want a cookie? Good to know you find a cats life more important than a humans. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Cart before horse Steeeeve?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It would seem thats the way the pro-choicers see it now. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>First you gotta let the child live, then worry about how to raise it. I don't have any problem whatsoever with letting children live. It's the failure to abort the cell sacks of the unwanted pregnancies that bothers me. If we are so intellectually advanced over the common animals of the planet, why do we rut in exactly the same fashion?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>The question is, how can raise a dead child? I mean, what good would it do to worry about raising a child if you just plan to abort it? If there were little to no abortions then you start asking the question about raising a child. I like the term " cell sacks " too.... you realize that you are a just a " cell sack " as well right? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Dead children do not require any raising. But, prior to an abortion, one must decide whether their promiscuous rutting session error in good judgement, or basic prophylactic failure, should completely upset their life's plans. That's why I think that " worrying how to raise the child ", should come first, meaning that the pregnancy is planned. Men are socially allowed to think with their little heads instead of their big heads. Women have a strong animal sex drive too. Love can temporarly blind most people to their best laid plans. These are small mistakes, or accidents, that can be remedied with an early abortion. It's a mistake that some learn from and some repeat. Have your children when you are ready to raise children. I am the undisputed King of the Cell Sacks. IMNSHO<br><b> S2:5-  </b>You can always put them up for adoption which requires " no raising " and thus abortion shouldn't be a question here Oops! got into a car accident... I'll just kill the other driver and no one will know, mistakes happen. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Why hassle with being pregnant for nine months, giving birth, and then giving away your newborn? The whole process can be legally nipped in the bud. You'd have to be a darn fool to go through all of that misery to give life to a child that you don't want to develop into a human being, just ' cause Steeve and his ilk thinks you should. Try grasping for another analogy. this one fell flat.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>It is actually already a human being at conception... but thats beside the point. You were talking about raising a child. I said, you don't need to plan if you give it up for adoption. Is this not true? Therefore you get pregnant you say " i won't kill my own child " and then you go " do I want to raise it or not? ". No need for " do I want to raise it or not ", no? " kill the baby then " I'm just using your same logic. Accidents can be remedied by killing the other driver. Is this the only way to handle it? No, but it is a way... just like abortion is a way to handle it. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>Terminating a pregnancy is not " kill the baby then ". There's no ' baby ' to kill. Abortion is legal. Killing the other driver after an accident isn't. Hence, no parallel.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>[ QUOTE = Mickey Shane ] Terminating a pregnancy is not " kill the baby then ". There's no ' baby ' to kill. [ quote ] What are you killing then? Nothing? Then why have an abortion. If you don't like the term baby use unborn human... I don't care. The point still remains from my last post. what does legality have to do with remedy for a mistake? I am using your same logic... hence parallel. If abortion were illegal would you find it morally wrong? <br><b>S1:8-  </b>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.. No<br><b> S2:8-  </b>[ QUOTE = Mickey Shane ] [ QUOTE = Steeeeve ] well there is an educated answer :) thanks for the feedback <br><b>S1:9-  </b>" No " is my answer for : That other garbage that you attributed to me, are your words, from your inability to form ' quote ' brackets properly, three posts back.<br><b> S2:9-  </b>Perhaps it was just at typo and I really have the ability to form " quote " brackets... considering I have done it many times before on these forums.... but thanks for the support.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>irrelavent since you provide nothing to the contrarty. These are standards currently accepted in medical arenas. Check with the AMA or NIMH or NIH if you want. EF<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I provided something to the contrary. Please note. [ As an aside, what possible good would come from checking with the AMA ( a political organization ) or the NIH, of which the NIMH is a part ( a research institute that does not publish primary research )? ] <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I am answering you separately. The AMA places standards for treatment that are used as an authority in legal procedings and is acceptable. My comments here are simply in response to Simone's statement that the studies posted are relatively old. The standard of care and of physiology can be easily documented. Lastly, Again, My argument is simply that abortion is in no way " pro child " There is nothing in any post so far to show even a shred of evidence that abortion is good for the one being aborted. EF<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It most certainly does not. Standards for care are based on local practice and are regulated by state boards of medical examiners. The AMA has nothing to do with that. You clearly are making up statements. You do not seem to know much about medicine or science. That is fine. You should therefore be more careful before making medical claims - such as claptrap about fetal physiology. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>http://www.ama-assn.org/ You might try looking under their ethics and standards section. They are most certainly a setter of the standards of care. Where do you think the local boards get their standards of care. It is that which is decided by the AMA. Also, you may have been arguing about my statement that babies have brainwaves as early as 6 weeks. You have yet to disporve that only you have proven the reason for them. Irrelevant. You simply cannot argue the point that I was making so you headed down a rabbit trail trying to derail my argument that " pro choice is not pro child " which I posted the physiology information to simply support my claim that these are babies and not some amorphous blob of tissue which is what the abortion advocates will claim so as to make it seem okay to kill a human before they exit the womb. My comments about post term abortions are to show the illogic of defining life by sentience or capabilities etc when taken to the extreme. Clearly you have little in logic training. EF<br><b> S2:3-  </b>This will be my last post to you on this. The AMA has no function other than advocacy. I am a XXXXXX. I know this. Linking me to the home page of the AMA is not a very convincing argument. My reference demonstrated that brain waves do not appear until much later. It had big words so maybe you missed it. I would be interested in knowing where you got your " logic training ", whatever that is, and if you can get your money back. How can you look at yourself in the mirror when you know you are posting ideas beyond your comprehension and present them as facts? You are not fooling anyone about your limitations. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>My last post too. It is not beyond my comprehension. I resent your statement. I find you arrogant and without a shred of intellectual integrity. You may be a fine physician. While the AMA is advocacy, are you saying you do not anwer to them at all concerning any standards of care and a medical board never references them. Yipes you are arrogant. EF<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What about the possibility of adoption? We so often act like there are only two choices, raise the child or abort it. There are many other options, including being careful in the first place. Just because a child is inconvenient seems to be a poor reason to abort it.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>There is also almost an entire year in between conception and that adoption. Pregnancy ain't easy or cheap. Quit trivializing pregnancy. It ticks me off. You asked how abortion is pro-family. If my already born family starves because I can't work an abortion would certainly be pro-family. If a pregnancy will endanger my life and leave my child motherless - an abortion could be pro-family. It could also be pro-child when you consider the possibility of multiple children. I am know my examples are possibly the extremes, but I felt inclined to answer. By the way - hello folks - I have been out awhile. Life got busy and tough for a bit. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>If you will please note, I have already been very careful to consider the health and safety of the mother. Please reread my posts. Some folks have abortions simply because they are too lazy to use birth control or too stupid to simply not have sex. That is not true in all cases and I think I already made that clear. I have trivialized nothing. Others trivialize the potential for life within them. Please stop trivializing that. Please don't call it " just a lump of tissue " that is simply not true. EF<br><b> S2:2-  </b>When you consider any cisrcumstance in a woman's except her health - " incovenience " or " laziness " or " stupidity " you do trivialize women. Life is not that simple. For starters one area that lifers continue to overlook is FINANCIAL. Pregnancies are EXPENSIVE. Doctors - new clothes - meds - hospital stays - potentail loss of work leading to unpayed bills, lost homes, etc. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Financial difficulties are overcome almost everyday. Do you think that because it is expensive to have a vasectomy that some men should not do that? I see a lot of men and women buying cars they cannot afford. Please just admit that some women ( and men ) make a stupid choice which leads to pregnancy. I never said they were all that way and your characterization of me in that vein is unfair, illogical, and in bad taste. EF<br><b> S2:3-  </b>And people starve every day. Even in the US. Not in my neighborhood. Nor in the five years I lived in poorest state in this country. I am not talking about things being tight for awhile. I am talking about being able to feed yourself - or get to a doctor when you are pregnant. Are you kidding - people do stupid stuff all the time. Irresponsbility ticks me off, too. ( But not as much as a governments, churches and neo-cons making major medical decisions for strangers without their input ). So is was your implication that abortion for any reason outside of ones health is a " convenience " matter. But I don't really wanna battle with you anyway. You seem more interested in education than imposition - and I am all for that. :) <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I never intended to say that abortion is always a matter of convenience. I appreciate your willingness to consider my full position. I am still opposed to abortion in a later term. I am opposed to some abortion procedures completely. I also believe women need to be told about the possibilities. I also believe Children are not able to clearly make that decision. I also believe certain abortion clinics are not held accountable as they should be. I am christian and I am also a TRUE conservative ( I don't really fit the neo con mold ). I would not judge a person who decides to have an abortion. I would want to counsel them that it is a very grave decision and that they may regret it and that they should consider other alternatives if possible. That is my stance. ' EF<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Not true if you are to successfully argue that exception, you would be required to prove that a human at conception is not a person. Furthermore, my argument does hold up. Just because two people can share one body, or the same DNA, it is not true to say their lives did not begin at conception<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Nobody can prove either way what a " person " is because that term has not been strictly defined by society. That is part of what we are all arguing here in the abortion debate. I define person as a human with mental existence. You define it another way. Neither of us has proof because proof is irrelevant where terms such as " person " that have no clear definition are concerned. Either way, the relevance of when a " person " starts is when rights start. I have given my reasons about why I think rights are given in the first place and how that relates to the minimum requirements for those rights ( i.e. mental existence ). I still have to hear from you about the reasons behind our giving rights and when, based on those reasons, rights should start. This is another one of those examples of points which I have brought up which you have ignored. If you do not wish to continue to be criticized for your debating style, then address the points which your opponents bring up. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>So you are claiming things with no facts to prove them. Too bad, you lose. Their lives still began then.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You are missing the point again. Neither of us win and neither of us lose when it comes to the definition of the word " person " since there IS no clear definition. I challenge you to answer this question directly : Do you think there is a clearly defined and widely accepted definition of the word " person "? If so, give a link to show the definition and its widespread acceptance. You can't? No surprise. That is because there IS no universally accepted viewpoint on when a " person " starts. That is why we are debating it, along with its influence on rights. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So stop claiming and speaking from a perspective that suggests you do.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I am stating my opinion about my meaning behind the word person, just like you have a right to your view as well. If you think that I said that my definition is the universally accepted definition, then quote me. Indeed, I have mentioned many times - in this thread and others - that the term " person " is not well defined and is something we are trying to debate. Also, I asked you : Do you think there is a clearly defined and widely accepted definition of the word " person "? If so, give a link to show the definition and its widespread acceptance. Does that mean that you accept that your definition of the word " person " is also not universally acknowledged? As for stating opinions on that definition and the rights behind it, it is not enough to make a statement. One has to give ones reasons behind it if one wants to be at all convincing. I have stated that I think people begin at mental existence and that is when we should first get rights, and I HAVE given my detailed reasons behind that view. I am still waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting for you to give your DETAILED reasons behind why you think a person starts at conception and deserves rights then. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So I was right to claim that your life started at conception, since this is true, whereas your opinion is just a lonely opinion. I have said many times now, how many more times do I need to do this : per   son ( p   r'sn ) n. A living human.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Abortion concerns a woman and her doctor, and no one else. A vote which would take away this control violates reproductive and sexual freedom. This involves an operation done by a doctor. I don't see the reason it needs to be voted on, as it tells a woman what to do with her own body. How would men appreciate women voting on whether or not they could have vasectomies, use condoms, be prescribed anti-impotence drugs, or be circumcized? Who is best to make these personal decisions?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It is one thing to say that something does not need to be voted on, and it is another thing altogether to say that something cannot be voted on. I don't so much mind the former. It is the latter that I disagree with. But I also think it is somewhat silly to say that we need should not pass a law that tells a man / woman what to do with his / her body. There are already laws which do this. Laws against prostitution, bigamy, and public decency laws, for example. These all tell women, ( and, incidentally, men as well ) what to do with their own body. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That is taking democracy to a ridiculous extreme, in my opinion, if we were to vote on everything, including the most highly personal matters. However, they do not affect one's body as intimately as when it comes to operations such as abortion.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>And? I'm glad you view child rearing as the imposition of a lifetime of suffering. Many people don't agree with this opinion. There is still nothing special about abortion that makes it off limits to the masses in a democratic society. As I said earlier, you would be free to vote against any restrictions on abortion. But, your opinion is no more valid than any other person's opinion. If the majority of people want to restrict abortion, they ought to be able to do so. In a democratic society, the purpose of government is a matter of opinion, and as such, it should be decided upon by a vote. In a democratic society, majorities are not constrained by a single conception of the purpose of government ; the majority determines the purpose of government. This of course means that the purpose of government can ebb and flow. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And I think that is even a greater intrusion on the individual as it more intimately involves one's body. In fact, in Canada the Supreme Court found that restricting abortion was a violation of the woman's right to security of the person. Oh, it can be if one was pressured into it. Forcively having to remain in a state of pregnancy one does not want is also suffering. People may have an opinion, but it doesn't automatically give them the right to force others to live by that opinion. There are also laws and a Constitution which protect the individual from every popular whim or opinion that may impose upon individual liberties.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I don't know anything about Canada. But in the United States, the things which are considered intimate personal decisions free from regulation are decided by the majority. And the majority in the United States has not ever conferred such an exception to their right to legislate. No, one person does not have the right to force others to live by their opinion. But, the majority has that right in a democratic society. Perhaps they give some level of protection, but that protection is not absolute as laws and Constitutions can both be changed.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No, it's simply that people often claim the existence of some sort of ' external world ' is proved, when all statements about matter are simply statements about how our sense data is ordered.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yes, in the absolute sense, the existence of the ' external world ' is not proved. However, in the practical sense, all of us, including yourself, live as if the external world is proved and nothing has proven us wrong yet. Every experience we and all humanity have had is consistent with that, so we have no reason to doubt the existence of the external world. Ultimately, it would be extremely arrogant for any of us to believe that existence is only composed of our own minds. I am guessing that your doubts are simply doubts as to what that external world is really composed of and whether our senses are reading it correctly. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>To be fair, all our experiences are also consistent with other scenarios, such as demonic deception, that we find less palatble, or seem more unrealistic. I think the claim that it would be ' arrogant ' to think that existence is our own minds is strange... when trying to reach truth this shouldn't be a consideration. An atheist might call a religious person arrogant for thinking that the supreme being cares about them, and a religious person might call an atheist arrogant for ' denying God ' or ' thinking there's nothing higher than them '. The philosophic position of solipsism is not the same as mere arrogance, although I know some who claim one who are merely the other.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>However, there is nothing in our experiences which suggests that it is a demonic deception. As long as there is nothing to support it, it remains one of an infinite number of possible theories. We generally have to work with what we have. Demonic posession also assumes an external existence ( namely, at least the existence of the demon ), so does the Matrix scenario ( in the existence of the machine world ). The only way that an external world would not exist - only our own single and solitary mind - would be if we were self-deceiving and self-created ( or always existed ) - essentially god-like characteristics which, yes, I still would consider arrogant. I am not saying that the idea of alternate versions of existence is an arrogant idea, just the idea that we are the only thing that exists is arrogant since its possibility would assume god-like qualities in ourselves. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>One of which is this idea of an ' outside world '. We generally have to work with what we have. Well, by ' external ' I was meaning apart from consciousness. The demon wouldn't necessarily exist physically. Another idea might be that we're one of many souls reaching closer to the truth of God or somesuch. The fact we have to think of these things in terms of an external world only shows how powerful a preconception it is, not that it's true.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>What we have is the experiences of all humans where our senses tell of of an outside world. Our eyes tell us that there is a section of floor in front of us and, if we step on it, we will not fall to oblivion. Our senses tell us that the object we see in front of us will respond as if its real - we can touch it, etc. All of our senses are telling us that the things we see are real. Yes, our senses can deceive us, as in optical illusions or false images that people might see when mentally damaged. That's where the trust of mutual experience and investigation comes in. One person may have the mirage, but ten others will not, so one can recognize which one is imagining things. I haven't heard of any mutual experience that people have had that suggests that the outside world we believe exists indeed does not exist. Yes, one scenario is a non-physical existence. However, once again, none of our mutual experiences have suggested that that is the case. That doesn't mean that it isn't, just that it has no support in human experience ( which is the only means we as humans have of finding out about our world, besides the unreliable means of imagination ). <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Our experience doesn't tell us that there is a physical object. We seem to instinctively reach that conclusion, but no sense data can tell you what caused that sense data.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Our sense data cannot tell us in an absolute sense that there is a real object, just that there appears to be a real object. All of the experiences of all humanity make it appear as if what we experience is real. Does that mean that it is absolutely real? Possibly not, but I would think that that possibility is small since NONE of our mutual experiences hint at those sensory inputs not being real.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>And you lost it again. That's OK - we'll get there. ;) But the point is you can't take the livlihood from the mother and expect her to have the resources for a successful pregnancy. True enough. It's an excuse - but then the illness or disorder has to be treated. Not until you tell me what the acronym stands for.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why not? because she doesn't want to? No one leaves the mental hospital after killing :p BPD = Borderline Personality Disorder ( see the movie : Fatal Attraction for extreme example ) there is also APD = antisocial personality Disorder... kinda like Hannibal Lector in Silence of the Lambs.. But my work is BPD :) <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I can't wait until you have to pay the bills all by yourself. No - because no means of support leads to no money leads to no food, house or doctor for her - and any other already born dependents that she supports. Time to take a quiz college boy. Now if jeapordizing one's career or livlihood is a reason women abort - which is the best answer - - - a ) BAN ABORTION ( and potentially let her and her family feel the repurcussions of that loss of money - or let her get an abortion illegally and unsafely ) OR b ) Find ways to make sure that pregnant women can continue to be supported if they have to stop working, and ensure that their job will be there when able to work again ( much of this is in place for higher paying jobs already - but there are severe gaps for the working class ) aaaah I actually am curious to know more about that, too. However I primarily work with pschyzophrenics, so I have been reading up on that more.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Yeah BPD is neat stuff. In taking the quiz. I would go with none of the above. If a women is in need of medical help and lets say she is homeless... I think people should help her out by providing home and food and medical help... whether she is pregnant or not does not matter here... we should address the problems that she faces. Now if she got into a situation that she lost a job and thus became homeless due to getting pregnant then we have a violation of the law and the company gets into some trouble. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Agreed. And if there were better things in place to address this and other needs - I think you would see abortion drop - not to mention both women and children would be happier and healthier. What beefs me about the pro-life side isn't that they want to reduce abortion ( I don't believe it's realistic to completely abolish ). I can totally get on board for that. But I can't get on board with how the pro-life movement. They put very little energy into actually helping these women, and a lot into demonizing them and trivializing everything they go through. You have done it countless times here. You have dismissed rape, mental health issues and even the need for a livlihood. I can't help you hurt women like that. Help me help them not need abortion and I will join your fight - until then, no. To a fire a woman for being pregnant - sure. But if she has to quit because she is pregnant? I was a waitress - had to quit at five months due to a major bleeding episode - I had to not be on my feet so much. Nobody fired me - but jobless I was.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Don't have a stroke anyone but I actually agree with Jitobear here. In fact, at the pro-life group on campus my roommate and I are trying to instill a new way to look at pro-life. We don't believe pro-life means anti-abortion... pro-life means help out life everywhere. And actually the group with " LIFE " across their mouths are like this... anyway, I think that all life should be charished and not just the unborns. If someone is hurt we should help them, if someone achieves something we should support them, I believe that if we try to help others become better then we will achieve more than trying to make yourself better. The idea may seem unrealistic but it has happened before. In WWII people set aside differences and worked together to achieve something. Look how awesome our country acted during that period. We can do better by working together and supporting life by helping each other rather than helping ourselves. This is my vision, my goal.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Well if the Mother is so desperate to hold on to her needs and wishes that she will kill, why on earth did she risk a pregnancy having sex? They are all so important, who did she think she was even daring to risk it? You're all under this idea that sex was created for pleasure, and it should be as available to everyone like Movies and Games. Well you are all badly mistaken. It's people like you that has treated sex as a thing for fun, and should be treated casually to the extent that young children are infected every hour daily by STD's and HIV. Ok, we've already blown off the resonsibility for sex all over the U.S. Look at how well that has done us.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Because sex is one of her needs. Check out Maslow's hierarchy of needs. This is just a theory, but it is very interesting. Many " needs " theories include the need for sexual intimacy. Along the same lines of reasoning, you are under the idea that sex is solely about procreation. Well, you are badly mistaken. That doesn't work so well. It would help your cause if you tried to understand that sex isn't just about making babies. It's easy to tell adult women who are in committed relationships that they shouldn't be having sex unless they want a kid, but in practice it's ridiculous. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>She won't die if she doesn't have her sex. But I'll be sure to check it out. I don't usually get this detailed on sex matters, but I will in this case. Sex is not strictly Vaginal Sex. Sex in general means a lot of things, and sexual satisfaction can be gained without Vaginal Intercourse. Vaginal intercourse, on the other hand, is the direct route to pregnancy. Then a couple steps back later in shock and says " Gee, she got pregnant! How did that happen? " Well guess what, they forgot a little reality of nature. What's ridiculous ( in this particular scenario ) is saying " I am in a sexually commited relationship with my boyfriend. Therefore, I am going to release my rights to my body and allow him to use me and risk my getting pregnant and all sorts of other things so he can get his sexual satisfaction.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You're right, but it is a NEED and to deny that fact is indeed a denial of the reality of what the human psyche needs. Thanks so much for the sex ed. I wasn't aware of other routes of sexual pleasure. So you are prescribing that people engage in other aspects of sex? Suddenly, you aren't so worried about STD's. Whoa! I don't " release " my rights to my body to my boyfriend / husband so he can get " his ". This assertion is ridiculous! You have a lot to learn about sex, young man. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Vaginal sex is not without its own risks, Bell. Then don't make statements about women in a sexually commited relationship as if they owed it to their boyfriend.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>* gasp* I did not say this, nor imply it in any fashion. I challenge you to support this statement. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Yes you did. I accept. ---- When you say this, you imply that it is ridiculous to tell women to abstain from sex since their partner may want some. I was showing off the dumb thinking a girl might have if she actually believed that.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No, you implied it. I did not. I said, I said this in response to your concept that if women don't want kids, they shouldn't be having sex. I said naught about their partner " wanting some ". You have either misread my comment, or read what you wanted to into it. You really think I believe sex is for pleasure only? I've said many times that sex is NOT JUST for procreation. Either you are being dishonest or have not retained this information. I said, " You have alot to learn about sex, young man! " and this was in response to your comment that women " release " their bodies over to their boyfriends for their boyfriends sexual satisfaction. Indeed, if this is your sentiment, then you do have a lot to learn about sex. Wouldn't you agree? Again, I said it's ridiculous to tell women in committed relationships not to have sex unless they want kids, because it is. Telling married women that they shouldn't have sex with their spouses ( for whomever's pleasure ) is a ridiculous notion. I didn't say YOU are ridiculous, but that concept is. Do not misquote or misrepresent me again. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>No, I believe I received the correct message when I read your post. I've made reading mistakes before, but I don't think I did this time. You're doing it again. I am referring to YOUR PARTICULAR SCENARIO that you said I either misread or read it in a way I wanted. I know girls don't normally just hand themselves over to their boyfriends whenever. And now I'm signing off for the night.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>You're right, you didn't make a reading mistake - you just made up something and then went ahead and said that I implied it. You have completely failed to address the facts laid in black & white before you.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Exploitation in that many women, who are concerned about their circumstances, aren't thinking clearly. Now, here comes this doctor saying, " we'll kill your baby for free! " That's exploitation.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You are SO insulting. " Oh, the poor dears have been through too much and are considering an action I disagree with so they must not be thinking clearly. " Who are you to say they aren't thinking clearly? I'll give it to you, Bassman. You are the most polite, best veiled misogynist I have ever encountered. You nearly had me fooled. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Try again, your arrows keep missing the target. I have repeatedly stated the reasons why abortion is wrong. Not only from a moral standpoint, but a practical one as well. And on the subject of the practical, I'll give you this little tidbit of info. We are fast becoming an aging population. Now, do the math. When you've already had 40 million unborn children aborted on the altar of " choice. " What does that leave is with? It leaves us with fewer younger workers to support the retirees. Now, with all due respect to you and yours, I did not mean to come across as insulting. I'm simply pointing out the connection betwwen abortion, euthanasia and eugenics.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I am not arguing with your stance on abortion. I am pointing out that your snide little comment that these women must not be thinking clearly is insulting and misogynistic. And it is. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>My bad, I should have been more sensitive. What I should have stated is that, with any traumatic situation, people have enough on their minds without the added trauma of abortion ( I know where you might go with this, so I'll save you the wear on your keyboard ). The effects of abortion are a well documented fact!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You continue to insult! The implication still stands that you are better able to make choices for these women than they are for themselves. God help your daughter. Will she grow up believing she is capable of making a single decision on her own? Sure, you do - regardless of what the mother may think about the situation. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Now that's a pack of lies. The thing is, abortion should never be an option. It is flat out murder. Pure and simple.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>And men who wish to hold our bodies hostage as you do should not have the option to touch any of us. Murder is a legal term and abortion does not fall under it. Are you saying killing is never justified? Self-defense? How about monkey head's war in Iraq? Are you saying women should even lay down their lives for a pregnancy - and even if they were raped? You coward. It is so easy for you to say what we women ought and ought not to have as an option. Really really damned easy. Not like it will ever realistically affect you. Every time you post your true colors show. You don't give a damn about women. You may care about your mom, sister, wife, daughter - but women in general? We don't even exist to you. No surprise. My family doesn't exist for you either. It amazes me that you see past your narrow vision at all to hold debate with me. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Now, now ; no need to get testy, there Your problem is that you can't or won't see past your blind hostility towards those who embrace life.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Using the same logic, then, you're advocating the right to rape, the right to steal, the right to arson, the right to... etc. So what is the difference here? " Well it's my body. " < buzz > wrong answer. In this day and age, we've lost the mere concept of duty, loyalty, responsibility, and obligation.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Try staying focused on abortion instead of going off on moralistic tangents ; the issue is civil liberty, a woman's right to abort a pregnancy. That is a woman's body and for you or a government to deny her the right to abort is infringing on her individual civil liberty, nothing else. I suggest you avoid using the word we in a patronizing manner when discussing abortion unless you can conceive, carry to term and give birth. It does create an appearance of substitution to avoid using a subjective I. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>" Patronizing? " I'm pointing out the flawed logic of your stance.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Using the word we to associate yourself with a theoretic woman's pregnancy while trying to impose your opinion of abortion when you're incapable of pregnancy is blatant patronization. ~ we've lost the mere concept of duty, loyalty, responsibility, and obligation. ~ And the flaw in civil liberty recognizing a woman's right to abort is? Stay focused, don't drift off into other subjects or moral issues. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I'm referring to the nation as a whole. That's easy, we need to regain those concepts and apply them into our lives. It's found nowhere in the US Constitution. And yes, it is a serious moral issue because we are talking about life. Not just lives of the unborn, but lives of the women who have been exploited by the abortion industry.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're evading the issue. This isn't an issue of a nation, including men, this is an individual right. Those women choose abortions and it is their right. You are not capable of conception so you use your belief system mythology to dominate their rights. Exploitation is denying them that right and forcing them to spawn children who are unwanted for what ever reason. You, as a male, are attempting to force your abortion moral standard on women. Why don't you just take away the rest of their hard-earned liberties? Voting, land ownership, divorce, freedom from servitude and on and on? Shuffle on back to some past point in history that fits your moral standards? I hear the ME World of Islam is looking for converts, just change some worship names and you'll have the moral standards you're seeking.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>1 Someone else = anti abortionists 2 you = a woman If a woman does not share the anti abortionists religious beliefs against abortion, then why should she be legally forced to abide by the anti abortionists religious beliefs?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Perhaps we just see it differently. If a woman does not share the view of the pro-lifer then you say being forced to could kill her. The difference is the pro-lifer sees it as two people, the unborn and the woman. So basically you ask if their is a chance of killing one should we be allowed to kill another. I'd say no. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>So then the anti abortionists POV should, in your opinion, overrides the POV of the woman that the issue concerns? Why is it that to you the religious belief of the anti abortionist is more important then the body of the woman? The fetus is a parasite on the woman, just as a tape worm is. Are you then saying that if the cult of the tape worm arises, then their religious belief should then be forced upon those who suffer from tape worms. Yes I know there is a difference between fetuses and tape worms but the principle is the same. Is someone elses religious belief more important then to be secure in your person and body?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>A fetus is not a parasite as a parasite has to of a different species. But even if you want to call a parasite it is still a human being and that overrides any belief of another. I reject the idea that a dispute implies we should have no laws on it. If this were true slavery should still be legal. Should your belief that slavery is wrong prevent those from getting slaves? If yes then why? You can tie it to abortion because you will end up saying something regarding a persons right to be free or whatever. Well, I believe in a right to life that overrides any a woman may have. Just as you may believe a right to do what you want with slavery doesn't override the persons right to be free. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>As I have said before. The fetus has the same rights as the woman if and only if it can crawl out of the womans body, stop its parasitic existance upon the body of another, and live on its own. In the salvery issue the right of the individual is violated by slavery. Why don't you read my posts? Is someone elses religious belief more important then to be secure in your person and body?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Those seem to be beliefs you are imposing. I, of course, disagree with all but the slavery issue. In any event, you wish to impose your belief that slavery is wrong on those that believe slavery is right. I believe I can impose my belief that abortion is wrong on those that believe abortion is right. Why don't you read mine. In the case of abortion ( which is what you are saying ) the right to life trumps any right the woman may claim with the obvious exception of life ( because in that case both are claiming the same thing ).<br><b>S1:1-  </b>If someone has a religious belief, you do not share that belief and the others religious belief could kill you, then should you be legally forced to follow the others religious belief?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Beside this being a description of the doctrine of fundamentalist ISLAM, would you post any evidence that any other religion has threatened to kill those who refuse to bow before their God? Knowing you, I resume you're off your meds again and are referring to Christianity. So feel free to support your claim with some evidence that you're being legally forced to follow this other religion rather than simply your paranoid hatred for anything righteous and good. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>1 Someone else = anti abortionists 2 you = a woman If a woman does not share the anti abortionists religious beliefs against abortion, then why should she be legally forced to abide by the anti abortionists religious beliefs?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You're displaying your irrational mindset again Matt, and as usual making no sense at all. In the OP you inferred that someones religious belief will lead to the death of someone else who doesn't share that belief. And above you switch over to abortion as if not getting an abortion will lead to a woman's death. Point 1 matt, abortion isn't a religion. Point 2, child birth doesn't = a death sentence for women. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>My OP was always about abortion, it is not my fault you can't read between the lines. Sometimes it does mean a death sentence. Anti abortionists want to ban all abortions.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Do you really think we would reject a revised law if it allowed abortions when the life of the mother was at risk? Is that what this thread is claiming, or are you once again making an extreme claim to support an irrational belief system? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>This thread is about the religious beliefs of the anti abortionists being imposed upon a woman, who does not share those religious beliefs. The right of the individual to be secure that their body will not be violated against their will is supreme over someone elses religious beliefs. I know what you will say next. What about the fetus? Yes the fetus has a right if and only if it can crawl out of the womans body, stop its parasitic existance upon the body of another, and live on its own.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>So is your skin, your brain, all your internal organs. There is a difference between a living cell and life. None of those living cells in your body alone could be construed as a human being. The sperm and the egg do not equate to life until the moment of conception / fertilization, which is their sole purpose. You try again.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It's a fair response. What is human life is different than asking what makes a human being. We could probably keep a brainless body alive for some time, but it wouldn't be what people would generally think of as a human individual, a human being, a person. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Is it? Scientifically it's not. What you're talking about is a philosophical and religious debate. And although I won't discredit philosophy, it's not a science, nor can it be proven. I can give you proof that a fertilized egg is a human life by the standards of science ( we can argue semantics all day but you can't refute that it is by definition " life " ). But you can't provide a single shred of proof that a fetus, unborn child or whatever you prefer to call it, isn't a person, a human being or a human life... not from a philosophical standpoint or any other.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Then I can certainly prove that the fetus is not a person, since ' person ' is a legal construct ( not a biological one ) and I can point to the relevant legal precedents that outline the subject in question showing the boundaries of ' personhood ' begin at birth. Q.E. D Of course, that ignores the crux of the question : namely, is the fetus a person in the philosophical sense. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Like I said, whatever you prefer to call it... they are one and the same. Can you deny that a fetus is a human life? I suppose YOU could, but that would be disregarding science as it's already been shown conclusively that it is, in fact, a human life. Technically the crux of THIS question on this post was " When does life begin? " There was nothing about the philosophical discussion of person or personhood. So, can you prove that a fetus is NOT a " person " in the philosophical sense?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I assumed this had relevance to the abortion discussion. Yes, the fetus is alive. If we agree on some basic tenets, certainly. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>It does. I thought I'd define the beginning of human life. As you can see, many people are still confused about whether or not a fetus is a human life. Please, do go on...<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Since you've agreed it is as alive as an individual organ is alive ( human life at that ), I don't think you gained much. I start with a hypothetical. If we remove the brain of an adult and put it in a jar while keeping both the brain and body alive and separate, would you agree that it is rational to say the ' person ' is in the jar? Meaning that if you killed the brain it is rational to say the individual would die, while if you killed the body the individual would continue to live. This hypothetical is to determine, loosely, what the definition of a person would be. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Wow, you have completely missed that entire discussion that just took place, didn't you? I don't know how many times I can say the same thing a different way for you to understand. I tell you what, go enroll in a biology class at your local college. Ok, so let me get this straight... your argument to " prove " to me philosophically that a fetus is not a person hinges on a basis of a hypothetical? One that isn't even possible? Sorry but to PROVE to me that a fetus isn't a person, you should probably start with facts, evidence or at least a common shared belief ( not based off a hypothetical situation that can't actually happen ).<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I read and even understood the thread. Sinjin posted : So far we appear in agreement that a thing can be composed of living cells with human DNA and not be a " human being " aka " person ". You replied : Yes, we are in agreement at that. If you want to add additional qualifiers such as " separate " and " distinct " that's fine but not part of the original point. Actually I'm starting with a definition. As I stated, the first goal is to establish the " basic tenets " to see what we agree on. So I'm seeing if we agree on the seat of individuality. If there is no agreement on the basics, then there is no common ground to even have a discussion because we would be talking about different things. So I'll ask again : Would you consider it rational to say that the individual person is in the jar? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Go back and re-read my entire response to that. Yes, a thing can be a living cell with human DNA and still not be a human life ( a skin cell, a sperm cell, an egg cell, any cell within the human body is a living cell with Human DNA and is not a human life or human being. Actually, you started with a hypothetical question, not a definition. A hypothetical question that isn't even based in reality. Yes, we have to start with common ground, but I'd prefer any common ground to be rooted in reality, not fantasy and science fiction.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>lol, alright. It hasn't improved upon review. Rofl, sure, we can start on an even more basic level if you wish. It'll just take longer. Surely you won't argue that human organs, even removed from the rest of the body, are not alive. After all, transplants occur and the organs don't die between one body and the next. Would you agree it is rational to say that you are not any less of a human being when you lose a kidney, and that kidney should not gain recognition as a human being, despite being alive and containing human DNA?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>A breast fed baby can be considered a parasite then... just as a flea and a tick is a parasite. Lets kill ' em<br><b> S2:1-  </b>if you believe that, then it's fine. i say it's more commensalism, even mutualism. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>So if I believe it its true? Id say that the fetus and the mother have a symbiotic relationship... which kind of makes it not a parasite<br><b> S2:2-  </b>actually, a parasitic relationships are symbiotic relationship. it's all a part of symbiosis. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Actually a symbiotic relationship is mutually beneficial wheres a parasite is not necessarily beneficial to the host. Its not all part of symbiosis at all. If you want to expand this into gaga land ( where you are heading really fast ) Flatmates / pets and pet owners / shopkeepers and customers / parents and children all must have a symbiotic relationship and therefore one of them are parasites. Its stupid. A woman has developed specific organs for the fetus.. this is not a parasite host situation. The mother gets to reproduce via the fetus.. this is not a parasite host situation. A fetus is the product of a mixture of the mothers genes... this is not a parasite host situation. Your assertion that a fetus is a parasite is stupid. A newborn feeds off the mother.. so does a flea and tick from the host. If you really think this constitutes a parasite host situation then you can believe what you like.. but you would be wrong<br><b> S2:3-  </b>actually, any parasite / host relationship is in a symbiotic relationship. yes, i agree what you are saying is stupid... but a fetus being a parasite is not stupid and science can proves it. you missed the part where i explained how the zygote invaded the woman's uterus. well, you are wrong... breast-feeding counts as commensalism.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It proves that if you take the tools of knowledge from M.D. ' s ( outlawing abortion ), that women, established lives, may be faced with a certain death. And it also proves that those who can afford the insurance, will recieve services. Are you willing to have PPhood close it's doors, so only those who can afford services, will get them?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Hydra no one want to take away the right for a woman to have and abortion if carrying the baby to term might kill her........... At least I don't........ Please............ <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I know a woman, who had a nursery prepared, had a number of baby showers. Both she and her husband wanted that baby. One day she went to work, and her auto was the first car at the stoplight. As that light turned green, she thought she was proceeding safely. The last thing she remembered was the name, Mack, on the truck that broadsided her. She suffered 5 broken ribs, lost the child, and her chance to ever have children, again. That is one reason she and her husband became so involved in foster-care.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>And my hat is off to you for raising foster children.. What is your point? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Maybe you missed it! That woman in the auto accident, is typing this. Take the life-saving away from the M.D. ' s, and allow the blood to drain from the body ; it's just another woman, her husband will find another...........<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I know it was you that is why i said my hat is off to you for raising all those foster children............ I am sorry you feel that way about men.......... <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Oh puhleeze! Grow-up ; I have a lack of respect for men who value the fetus over an established life.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I have a lack of respect for them too..... What about men who value both lives equally? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>When there are total doubts about the safety of the woman's life? Well, you just shot you Pro-Life stance in the foot, by placing the woman's life at risk.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I have always professed that stance.............. you are new hear you need to go back and read the thread.......... We know......... If you say so, that still does not make unnecesary abortions ok which is what we are talking about........ <br><b>S1:6-  </b>We are talking about abortions that may be necessary, whether you believe it or not! Tell me what an ectopic pregnancy is, and the danger it poses.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Again Hydra are there any abortion that are unnecessary in your mind? What percent of the 40,000,000 million butchers in the womb since 1972 would you consider unnecessary? And educated guess will suffice.. Just curious.......... <br><b>S1:7-  </b>What is an ectopic pregnancy?<br><b> S2:7-  </b>You answered the question with a question..... Just answer my question........ Are all abortion justified in your mind?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Just to add something that Parcum's said before : we are able to save babies who are more and more premature - so the woman can leave her baby, so to speak, earlier as medicine advances. We may even be able to raise babies purely in a test tube before too long. ( although I have reservations about how healthy the baby would be )<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Thankfully, some US states and other places have " safe haven " laws, so that people can avoid prosecution if they give their children to hospitals, etc. The difference is that you can just hand a baby to someone else, which you can't do with a fetus. It's not as simple as pre-birth vs post-birth. I don't know exactly what the laws are in all states, but it seems to me that people either have an abortion while the fetus is still in it's rudimentary developmental stages, or keep the pregnancy until birth, unless of course there are other complications. So you are comparing a fetus at mostly 8 - 12 weeks to a pre-born infant at almost ten months old - they are not the same. Again, a medical procedure is required. In other words, this doesn't mean that a woman can reach in and pull out her 4 month old fetus and walk into the emergency room with it. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That's true. I guess I would go back to my earlier question of whether the difference justifies the killing of the unborn human.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I think so. I generally follow the doctrine of harm reduction in terms of decisions usually considered in the category of " morality ". <br><b>S1:3-  </b>That seems to be a common beleif for someone who doesn't beleive in a Creator. What is your position on animal, and human testing? For instance, there's a rather infamous scandal where troubled children in an orphanage were used as test subjects for a Hepatitis immunization. Half of them were deliberately exposed to Hepatitis to test the drug. Do you think that these things are justified if they may save thousands, or millions of lives? Another question I have is about people who live painful lives. In my province, a man was jailed for killing his severly retarded girl - who went through a lot of pain and treatment. He continues to claim it was a merciful action. What do you think about such cases? Finally, back to abortion, what do you think of the arguement that abortion generally increases harm for women and society? I recently read an article that said things like child abuse - which it was beleived that abortion would decrease - have increased substantially since Roe vs. Wade. And there are the hundreds of women who have presented testimony to the Supreme Court on the harmful effect of abortion.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I think you're mixing up harm reduction with utilitarianism. Harm reduction originates in the field of health providers for drug users, but is now a broad philosophy of health care services in general. There's more info on-line, if you're interested. It has nothing to do with belief or disbelief in " a Creator ". That hasn't been my experience, I've known several people who had abortions of various kinds. That's anecdotal, but so is your claim. I wouldn't bother. The video is heavily doctored, it isn't a clinical analysis of the abortion process. Yet when it's done to an animal that is not human, it's okay? That makes no sense. Organisms that can feel pain we should avoid inflicting pain on. Human or not. We should avoid killing when we can. However, I'm not going to refuse to take antibiotics based on the bacteria's " right to life ". Obviously a human fetus is not bacteria, but it isn't a born human either. Life is full of hard choices. Whether or not to have an abortion is one of them. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I see... harms reduction means " they're going to do it anyways, so we might as well make it as safe as possible ". I assume you wouldn't follow harms reduction when another human being's right to life is involved. If so, our disagreement lies with wether or not the unborn human is as valuable as the newborn. I didn't know that. I think it would be interesting to see a real time video. I beleive that human beings are priceless. That stems from my beleif that God created us in his image. I completely beleive that animals should not be killed or damaged for no reason, I beleive they are amazing creations as well. One of God's directives to mankind in the Bible is to be a caretaker for earth. I can't say I've thought much about the morality of animal testing... but I think if such testing can save human life it is justified. I have to say once again that the disagreements here seem to boil down to whether we view the unborn human as different from the born one, with regards to rights and value.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>First, I don't believe in " rights ". I believe it's important to having a manageable human society that people aren't running around randomly killing each other. I believe it's bad to make a being endure unnecessary pain. Abortion is not applicable to the above. Second, as I said, we are not comparing an infant 24 hrs before it will be born from an infant the minute after it is born, we are comparing an 8 - 12 week old blastocyst / fetus to a newborn. For one, it's not a " real time video ". Its a piece of visual propaganda, heavily edited, with fake sound effects and slo-mo camera work. It's like how B movie directors make their monsters look scary when they're just a 4 inch high plastic doll. Camera tricks. I also don't see how an abortion could be interesting to watch. Seems a little wierd to me, unless you're an ob / gyn surgery resident. I get it. You believe in the church, I don't. That's the difference here. It has nothing to do with relative value, it has to do with your religious beliefs, that I don't share.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I agree with you, that's just plain silly. First of all we don't know if a soul even exist, and secondly, even if we had proof that it did, we have no way of knowing when it becomes reality for that person. Maybe it's like sin, you know, aman-made concept ;)<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I know that the soul exists, which is why I made my claim. Just as sin isn't a man made concept but a reality that is proven whenever you feel guilty for doing wrong. I mean only sociopaths feel no guilt when sinning, are you saying that you're a sociopath? What's a ZEF? Is that another secular humanist term that's intended to marginalize the unborn babies that pro-abortionists endorse killing to the tune of 1.4 million a year? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>LOL :p If you knew it was a fact ( which is impossible ) then you wouldn't have called it a ' claim ' ;) Ooh... that's gotta hurt If that's true then you should be able to prove it. Knock your socks off. You'll excuse everyone else if we don't hold our breath. OH MY GOD! You're in an abortion debate and you don't even know what a ZEF is? What a joke! You have just lost all credibility. Please wait for the ride to come to a complete stop before attempting to exit.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Why not? I can make any claims I want to make about any facts I choose to make them about. Is there some grammatical rule that states that using the word claim in conjunction with a fact is improper or fallacious? Be clear son, you're not making any sense. So no, it doesn't gotta hurt at all, for me anyway. Duh... me so dumb. And evidently google is too because nothing came up in reference to the unborn or abortion when I googled it either. I must assume that I hit the nail right on the head when I said this : What's a ZEF? Is that another secular humanist term that's intended to marginalize the unborn babies that pro-abortionists endorse killing to the tune of 1.4 million a year? Which explains why you edited everything after my question in order to attempt to ridicule me with just the question. Kind of lame and a very weak style of debating, not to mention dishonest. Now if ZEF means anything different than how I defined it, then own up and define it unless you just made it up. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Most anti-choicers do :p Since when do grammatical rules have anything to do with proof about souls existing? We're still waiting for that hard core proof ;) That doesn't say much for google now does it Try a medical dictionary or a dictionary with acronyms. It's a well known medical term so I'm sure you'll find it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're a sanctimonious fraud ingus. There's no definition for the word ZEF in the online medical dictionary. No match for ZEF Sorry, the term ZEF is not in the dictionary. Check the spelling and try removing suffixes like " - ing " and " - s ". Here, check for yourself. http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/omd/ Now stop playing games and just admit that you made the word up or tell us what you claim it means. Are you referring to the word zygote? And I ask only because it starts with a z also. Either way, stop calling me ignorant if you can't explain what a word you used means. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well that's not very christian of you now is it? :p There is only one online medical dictionary? So just because you aren't educated in these matters that suddenly means that the other person is playing games or made something up? Stop acting so immature, and stop making accusations. No one made anything up. Ask a midwife or a Obstetrician if you don't believe me Archangel if you don't know these BASIC medical terms then how can you claim that you know anything about abortion? If I just give you the link then what would you have learned? I've read at least 3 posts from you where you have displayed an immature outburst. Debating the topic of abortion is one of the most heated issues that you will find. If you can't swim in the deep end of the pool then you should be in the shallow end. Quit embarrassing yourself while your ahead If I, or someone else has to post a link, that's going to take away all of your credibility. You wouldn't want that now would you?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You need to read the statement from the person who was saying it's point of view. A person would not say " my claim is that the sun is hot " if theyreally knew it was hot, they would just say " the sun is hot ".<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Bull hockey. It is common to refer to statements as claims regardless of their truth value. This is especially true in philosophical / logical arguments. I'm a new part of that education system, bub. The fact is that you said you didn't say what you actually did say, and now you're trying to cover that up by giving an alternate explanation that ignores the fact that this is a debate forum where " claims " are labeled for what they are : claims. It's a shame our education system has to compete with numbskulls who hold their misplaced opinions in higher regard than people trained in those areas. News flash, Holmes : I never said that souls existed. I never even implied such. I took a quick rip at Archie's pathetic arguments early in the thread and have since been arguing with you about why calling something a claim would mean that it isn't believed. If you want to argue that souls don't exist, or that nobody has shown that souls do exist, then your arguments had better be better than vacuous attempts to nail someone for faulty phraseology. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I know what I said and so does everyone else. It's a matter of public record Quit trying to manipulate the facts. It just wastes everyones time and leads the topic even more off course than it already is Sorry electrolyte, that one was my fault :( I wasn't trying to suggest that you made that comment, just that I was still waiting for said proof. My appologies. I should have re-quoted the person that did say it but now I think they ran away. Oh well... guess they can't prove it :)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But I'm not manipulating the facts. Any reader with the inability to read your mind ( which is everybody on the planet besides you ) can read your words but apparently not know what you mean, since you say what you don't mean. I posted our statements right next to each other for everybody to read. This is the point. They can't prove it. They can't even present halfway decent arguments. So let's make that the issue instead of pulling claims of psychology-induced Freudian slips. And no, he's still here. He just loves " allowing " the thread to be derailed. Trust me, he does it himself, especially when he's getting his XXX kicked. Keep pointing out that he hasn't shown ( and can't show ) that souls exist, and he'll stop posting in the thread. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yes you did. Funny how your interpretation was different To be honest I'm not even sure what this thread is about anymore, this is the abortion section isn't it? :p My oh my how on Earth do you ever debate someone like that? Seems it would just waste a lot of precious time. In any event THANK YOU for the heads up. Looking forward to a great debate<br><b> S2:3-  </b>This is what happens on internet debate forums when you aren't very clear. Sadly enough, some people here can take a statement that is only the tiniest bit unclear, spin it, and then continue to misrepresent it even after explicit clarification. ( Free preemptive tip : don't try to be sarcastic online unless you somehow make it incredibly obvious that it's sarcasm. ) With Archie, it's not " debate " at all. I beat him over the head with the Truth Stick of No Mercy    and expect no rational response. Another free tip : don't look forward to many of those with Archie. Other people here do show promise, though. He's not ; he's just purely irrational. His irrationality stems from the fundy mindset he's locked himself into. Beware the vile he'll spew at you when you kick his XXX. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>[ sarcasm ] The cow jumped over the moon [ / sarcasm ] LOL He's probably just frustrated ( or constipated ) :p<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Forced pregnancy will not fix it. It will not fix rape, incest or other causes. But when women start realizing they can't jump out of being responsible for their sex life, they will start having sex less. Even if it doesn't work completely, it will decrease the amount of abortions some. Oh, and killing a baby so you can enjoy sex is purely selfish. It is nothing less than murder. It shows off inhumane people will go because they are so desperate for sex. Sex is pleasurable, but it was created first and foremost for sustaining human life. You can't ( unless tubes are tied ) just have sex and kill willy-nilly.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This has no basis in fact. I don't know what forced pregnancy means. If you mean making abortions illegal, it will reduce the number of abortions somewhat, I predict. But, like most prohibition, it will not have much effect and illegal abortions and their consequences will proliferate. Abortion is not baby killing. Stop saying that. Using silly sensational language indicates a lack of a thoughtful argument. This paragraph demonstrates little understanding of sexual drive and sexual behavior. Also, no one is having abortions " willy-nilly. " <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It would help though. Murder and rape are illegal, and people still commit those crimes. It obviously helps to keep those crimes illegal, it would lower the numbers, Abortion is baby killing to me, and I'll use the wording I prefer. I'm to look at a person willing to kill a baby just to have sex and try to be understanding?!? And I did not say people have abortions willy-nilly. People want to have sex willy-nilly, so they'll go to extents like abortion to get it without extra burdens. There are people like that, a lot of people in fact.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Please let us know how you know that. What do you think about prohibition and how that affected alcohol consumption? As well as the other crimes that were associated with it? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You don't know, thelmoose? I guess not. Well I'm not here to educate you as if you suddenly had no idea of the effect prohibition can do. I don't know what you're talking about when you say alcohol consumption. You got a specific issue?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>1. Nice dodge. I repeat : How do you know what effect making abortion illegal will have on the frequency of abortions and the amount of sex that occurs, both of which you asserted. 2. If you don't know what my reference to alcohol means, you may not know what Prohibition was ( capital P ), which is directly relevant to #1. Look it up and then you might be able to respond. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Because laws have stifled things like this before. Even if it hadn't completely stamped it out. Slaves were considered a legal right before Abraham Lincoln came along. It was abolished and made illegal, and now there are very few if any people who have slaves in their homes. Now do you understand?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Huh? That's pretty whacked. You said that if abortion was illegal, " they will start having sex less ". Please tell me what evidence you have that this would take place. You have yet to anwer that. It is clear the Prohibition reference is still sailing over your head. When Prohibition went into effect, alcohol consumption did not cease, and there was a great deal of illegal activity generated. Now, the comparison between the behavior of alcohol consumption and abortion is not perfect, I'll admit, but I wanted to discuss you assertion that making abortion illegal will reduce abortions by comparing it to an historical precedent. I think it is a fair comparison if you are talking about sexual behavior. This kind of thing is what you do in arguments, rather than making claims and not backing them up. Making abortions illegal will create unsafe abortions to occur and many unwanted children to be born. If my Prohibition comparison was off the mark, your slavery comparison is positively looney. It's a little difficult to have slaves on your plantation and not have anyone notice. One statement you made is a safe bet, but I hope you were trying to be humorous : " now there are very few if any people who have slaves in their homes. " <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I can understand where you wouldn't believe laws stop things altogether. I find myself agreeing that making abortion illegal may not make it completely nationwide itself. But making abortions illegal will reduce sex a little if not a lot. I believe that if pregnancy was an issue you once again were made to live with, men and women would not be so casual about it. There are two points where you're predicting results are faulty. 1. Children unwanted is nonsense. There are couples out there who can't wait to adopt a child or children. 2. And making it harder to commit a crime is not wrong. If abortion were declared a crime, then illegal abortions being made would make no difference. Men get injured and killed during robberies all the time, maybe we should make that legal.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Let me turn this around on the pro-choice side since it is a common objection but an unfounded one. Why do you advocate a means of violence to solve a woman's problems ( abortion ) when you object to a means of violence in solving society's problems ( capital punishment )?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Capital punishment : A major act of violence killing a human being, and you are in no imminent danger of being attacked. Abortion : Sometimes a necessary measure to make sure that Women's needs are met, and that they may pursue happyness. Yes, its a horrible thing, but some pacifists would argue killing something in self defense is wrong too. Such as if a criminal or rapist attacks you on the street, and you were carrying a firearm and shoot and kill the offender. It is legal to do this, and it would be justified. Same with abortion, the law says its justified, and for now, we should follow the law. Trying to change the law is ridiculous, and in my opinion horribly immoral. Again, opinions. You have the opinion that a fetus or embryo has the power to override a womens right to her own body, and we think that a woman has an inenfringable right to her own body. Don't get me wrong, i think abortion is horrible. But denying a woman the right to her own body is even worse. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I'm puzzled as to why you think abortion is horrible yet you don't even think the thing being aborted is human or worthy of protection. As for changing the law being immoral... changing an immoral law is not immoral but moral. Is pursuit of happiness a legitimate reason to abort?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I think the REAL human is worthy of protection from people like you. The law is not immoral now. It is the woman's choice if she wants to abort or not, NOT YOURS. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Perhaps you can explain then why you think abortion is horrible yet the thing being aborted is not a human. Perhaps you can tell us as I have requested many times, when your arbitrary point of humanhood occurs. Elementary science tells us that a new, distinct, living, human being is present at conception.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I think squishing bugs is horrible too, but i dont think bugs are human. I do have sympathy for non-human organisms too, just not as much as i do real humans. Humanhood occurs when the baby starts to take form, its brain starts to grow, its heart starts to beat. I think its a human when it starts to develop some human characteristics. I don't like abortion, but who am i, and who are you to tell the woman what to do with her own body? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The REAL human : human life begins at conception 18 days after conception the heart is forming and the eyes start to develop 21 days the heart is beating and pumping blood throughout the body 40 days brain waves can be recorded After the 1st trimester almost nothing new develops or begins functioning. There is mostly growth and maturity of what is already there. It is a human when " it starts to develop some human characteristics? " Then it is human all along. The trick is to get the woman to begin thinking of this other thing in her body also... to get her to begin thinking that there is more present than just her body.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Human life begins at conception, however a human being or " person " begins at first sign of intelligent. See above. I'm not for late term abortions, but I don't really worry. 95% of abortions are in the embryo stage, so we should be really referring to whatever it is as an embryo. I meant its a human being or " person ". My hair is human, my nails are human, my kidneys are human. An embryo is just another organ in the womans body. Its completely dependant on the woman, but I don't see you rallying against kidney donations. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>How is it " human " life if it is not a human being? You do acknowledge above that " human life begins at conception. " How have you come to know that the " person " is present at first sign of intellect? Again, you need to study elementary science if you would classify an embryo as " just another organ. " It is quite different than that.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>My hair is a human life [ form ]. I am a human being. Because how we think of a person. People are not people if they arent even aware of their own existance. How come it is not? It is completely dependant on the woman, and resides inside of a woman's body. I believe that is the defonition of an organ, however my internet is acting up. I'll get the def. shortly. Stand by... Ah! Here it is : Biology A differentiated part of an organism, such as an eye, wing, or leaf, that performs a specific function. Well, a fetus is part of an oraganism, and performs a specific function. Therefore it is an organ.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Eugenics may not be the same but they are related. Abortion and artificial birth control have their origin in eugenics ( Margaret Sanger ). There are elements of eugenics in the current abortion mentality even if there is no united, cohesive, entity promoting eugenics. You hear it said on other threads that abortion will reduce crime. There is a mentality of abortion in the case of deformity or down's syndrome as being common sense or the standard that should be instituted. There is a tinge of eugenics in those who abort to preserve lifestyle or reputation.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Almost lost my lunch here. You really think abortion started with her? That's HIGH-STARE-ICKLE! I know - it's not like women need money, jobs, a place to live, food to eat - us, our kids and our fetuses survive off of air alone. And pregnancy is easy and delivery don't hurt! Ahh, the tinge of the misogynist in all lifers out there.... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Please see my above post to simone. I don't argue that women need those things but is it worth killing a living, human, being, flesh of one's flesh, bone of one's bone, blood of one's blood for? No misogyny here.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If its result of rape or a threat to my health or the livlihood of myself or son - yes. And that is my stance. Period. Regardless of law. But don't worry - I am safe and my tubes are tied. And here is one I hope doesn't make your head explode. I don't agree with eugenics. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>http://http://www.defendlife.org/newsletters/June2005/maas.htm http://www.humanlife.org/abortion_jenni_story.php<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Good for Jenni's mom. She made her choice. My life and and body are still not up for grabs. Ever.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>A fetus only has one of these things. BTW, what is a soul? Can you prove that you have one, that I have one? It is more than easy enough to prove the existence of a mind.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So, you don't think that they have a body? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>What does that have to do with the so-called soul? The old saying goes " body and soul ". What exactly is a soul and has it been actually proven to exist like all other parts of the body have, including the mind?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I'll go over this again, as you seem to have missed it. Let's look at it now in a little more detail Robbie says the person has three things ; mind, body and soul You say it only has one of these things. You obviously don't believe in a soul, that leaves only a mind, or a body. So, which is it? Well, now you're saying it's just the soul that doesn't exist. So, before there was one thing, now two. A case of you changing your argument again? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The fetus only has a developing body and you knew that is what I had meant. You really like to twist words into something which isn't there. Don't you. Well, I guess that you have to since you don't have any valid arguements to begin with.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So you're saying you have valid arguments that don't make sense? I can only argue against what you write, and you wrote that they only have one, then you changed it. If I'd have made that mistake, I'd have gone " Ooops, sorry ", but you don't, you just blame that on me too! That's a valid argument! :) As I've asked you to do in the past, take some time before you respond. If I made a mistake, I'm sure you'd be the first to point it out, actually there'd be a three-corner race between you, Lurch and SLP. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I changed nothing. You knew which one I had meant.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Don't confuse murder with justice, sport. You radicals always do that. You want to mess with God? Then be prepared to meet him at your Judgment.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>If we adopt your beliefs will we become like you? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>For starters you'll quit defending butchering the unborn.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Because defending the butchering of the unborn will get us sent to hell, right? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yep, unless you repent and receive Christ. You can count on it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So my motivation is purely self serving? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>He wondered.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Sorry, I should have said YOUR motivation is purely self serving.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>So, how many unborn babies did your God drown in Genesis? Talk about hypocrisy.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What if the answer to that was 0? You have begged the question. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Then you would have to be believe that out of the supposed millions upon millions of people who walked the Earth none of them were pregnant and there were no newborns either. Then again, to be Christian, you also have to believe the world was created in 7 days and their was a Biblical great flood too. The best part about writing a fairytale is that the author gets to make up everything as they go along.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Or could it be possible that God, as the sovereign and just Creator of the universe, through his divine will, could have orchestrated the world in such a way, that there was not one pregnant person on the earth during this time period? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yep, the same    sovereign    creator who gave parents the right to slaughter their unruly children just POOF made everyone magically become unpregnant so it could ease the conscious of those who oppose abortion hundreds of years later and not find themselves feel conflicted over worshipping a supernatural abortionist. Or did god just kill millions of    unborn babies    because he knew hundreds of years later their would be Christian apologists who find ways to sugarcoat his brutalities? I suppose the later would take less effort in the end. But God never said he stopped people from giving birth or having babies so I assume he just went ahead and slaughtered them none the less. Wow, some divine being you worship. Killing tiny little unborn babies. What a tough guy! Sure showed them something about morality!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Oh I don't sugar coat what he did. I just hold to sound Biblical doctrine that says God is just in everything he does. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So then you renounce your pro-life feelings and decide to worship and support a being that used genocide and chattel slavery against innocent human beings? Apparently you just did.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Wow, apparently you can't deduce one logical thing from any statement I make. I said : If God is just in everything He does, as the Bible obviously states He is, then it directly follows that he cannot be impugned by anybody for what He does. He especially can't be impugned by any human being, who we can safely assume is not omniscient, and therefore cannot know the situation fully. For you to imply that you are more just than God, is to imply that you know more than God does, which by reading your posts on these forums, we can safely say is flat out wrong. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Thank you. There isn    t anything logically about what you said. If Position A says you must respect Authority X and if Position B makes you worship something that doesn    t respect Authority X then you provide a double standard. A person can only serve one ideology in matters like these. You may feel god is against abortion but it isn    t. Apologist logic    people commonly use to this defense to excuse psychopaths from their crimes. Because we can    t understand we cannot judge. And pro-choicers use it to when they believe men    s opinions are irrelevant on the issue because they    ll never be pregnant. No human being can judge the complete motives of another and by your logic we should let all criminals free. Your comment is weak of morality. More me to judge your god is to imply just that    I can judge. If you want to search for hidden meanings then be my guest but you are just utilizing the fallacy of attacking the messenger instead of the message.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>No it isn't. I clearly said God is just in everything He does, not that men are just in everything they do. When we are talking about what the Bible says about something, we assume the entire Bible. Thus it is impossible to refute my claim, on Biblical grounds, that God is just in everything He does. I have shown that for you to judge God is to in fact claim that you know more than God. The only way you could be right in saying this is if you know more than He does. This thread is arguing on Biblical grounds, that is, what the Bible says ; and as such, it is again impossible to refute my claim. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>God is just in everything he does because it judges it    s actions as such. It has nothing to do with reason. Since when was knowing more then the other guy a prerequisite to judgment? God commits murder, therefore I condemn the murderer. Understood? I am not interested in the excuses of a murderer. Murder is murder. I am not arguing on    Biblical grounds   , I am arguing on moral grounds. This forum has left talking on just Biblical grounds a long time ago. Another logic fallacy. Are we catching red herrings in order to compensate for a lack of substance to the topic? Do you have an axe to grind with me? I must warn you that people who hold grudges discard logic and dignity to fulfill their emotionally charged impulses. Having an axe grinding and army of logic fallacies will serve you no good against me.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Um, not really. It is murder for the state to execute a innocent person?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I dont see where VOR says those people should be murdered. So your claim is unfounded again. he didn't say innocent person.. he said people that commited those crimes that he stated. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>What is the punishment for such crimes as dictated in the bible? DEATH. Except he doesn't believe anyone has been innocently murdered when the facts say there are. I'd like to get back to your claim. Your claim should be changed to " we don't let people who support abortion say unfounded claims but people who don't can say anything they want, even itf it is obviously wrong in every obvious way. "<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This is another claim that you provide no backing for.... It is a " because you say so " arguement, which you are against ( as stated by the thread you posted ). I will point out if I see a claim that is unfounded to me.. it is that simple. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>What? Now you're just lazy. I haven't seen cone argue once that VOR was wrong. Even in his most INSANE arguments, especially the one that because a bill was one vote short that it has a hard time passing from now on. I haven ; t seen you do that either. That's pretty selective. It appears you people are fully willing to let someone who is aganist abortion go off on insane arguments which have no facts but hold someone who supports abortion to that standard. Your claim should be changed to " we don't let people who support abortion say unfounded claims but people who don't can say anything they want, even itf it is obviously wrong in every obvious way. "<br><b> S2:3-  </b>If not reading every post on every thread is lazy then YES I am lazy. However, as said, if I see unfounded claims I will call it out. I have pointed out your unfounded claims so far. Will I miss some? Maybe! I can't read everything everyone writes. However, yours was called out and now I think you owe VOR an apology for making a claim about him that was untrue.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Luke 1:15 "... he ( John ) will be filled with the Holy Spirit while yet in his mother's womb. " Here John is deemed a person while in the womb.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I didn't see the word abortion in Luke. Maybe if you wouldn't mind so much could you please show me where God mentions something about it? Because I asked for a direct passage on abortion. Not one that you think / feel / believe that COULD be. I am looking for the concrete. Not the subjective. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Luke 1:15 "... he ( John ) will be filled with the Holy Spirit while yet in his mother's womb. " Take this along with the passages denouncing murder. Along with the passages Cone and Steeeeve have mentioned.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That is nice but that still doesn't condemn abortion. Abortion is legal. The Hebrew word for murder exclusively means illict killing. Abortion isn't illict. You failed again. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yes it does How not so? Prove it Biblically. Its been proven to the contrary.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No. It doesn't. You are just forging links and it is starting to look depserate and sloppy. I am not here to prove your points. That is your job. There has never been a Hebrew law against abortion that placed it as murder found. Never. However if we had to guess I would think abortion was permitted in Hebrew society. Considering the Jews believed that life started at birth and burial rituals were only permitted to those who were above six months of age after birth. Apparently fetuses were not equal to born people in burial cermonies. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Sloppy Joe Sloppy, Sloppy Joe Sloppy Joe Sloppy Sloppy Joe. You are living in lunch lady land. Here is an obvious link. We have seen that in the Bible, people are viewed as persons while in the womb. We have also seen that murder is unlawful. Conlusion : Murder of those persons in the womb is unlawful. How hard is that? Points have been proven. Guess all day long if you want. You are waisting your time cause it is black and white.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I see you are living in redundancy land    where apparently if you say the same time long enough it becomes a truth. All you did was re-write the same argument but vomited it out before but this time using different words. Abortion is not unlawful. You haven    t even proven it as such yet. Keep trying    I see you are at the end of the line here. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Well, truth is truth no matter how many times you say it. We are discussing what the Bible says about the issue of abortion not what you or I or augustine or the pope or anyone else says about it. We have proven that it is Biblical to say that abortion / murder of the person in the womb is unlawful. That means that the Biblical and true Christian stance on the issue of abortion is that it is unlawful. Linus, I dont understand. The actual words have been given to you. Yet you ignore them. If you have a point to prove then prove. Or if you already feel you have, show me where you have proven that it is not Biblical to say that abortion is wrong.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I don't understand why you search for something that can't be found. Every theologian agrees that abortion is never mentioned in the Bible and this is very apparent because you haven't proven anything except your poor use of mixing and matching bible verses to support your political agenda. I have asked for biblical proof of how abortion is murder and none so far. However, it doesn't matter and I asked specifically for a verse directly on abortion. You can mix two, three, four or even hundreds so you can boil it down to a single message but it still comes down to the fact a direct verse would only involve one passage. This is all I asked for and having read the Bible myself I expect you'll never find something that doesn't exist. Nice try though.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I find it interesting how you are using the fraudlent argument of changing the subject to get around the fact that you are too lazy to actually find the link I posted 4 times that shows VOR's history. While you may not have been lazy there, you are clearly using the fallacy of argument via laziness here.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why? Because you say so? Hypocrite, flat out, hypocrite. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>call me names all you want. It's not my fault you are too inherently lazy to click on a link I provided many times. After all, I provided the means, I cannot force you to look. Is someone cranky that I called the fallacy before you could use it to gain a advantage? Don't worry, that happens alot. When a argument is primarily based upon a fraudulent means, the user often gets very irrated when the foundation is suddenly pulled out from them and the argument crumbles like a house of cards. Don't feel bad. Besides, keep defending VOR, it won't be my problem when you support someone who has no grasp of political ideologies, financial systems, or history in general. I must say though, it has been a while since I've seen a argument entirely based upon a single fallacy. But I suppose that is because of your lack of expierence with them. If one is going to base their argument on a fallacious method, they normally do so using a few, as to guard aganist what just occured to yours. One or two can be pulled out, but as a whole the argument is still alive.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>As such, your argument is still a " because I say so. " Because of this, I have clearly pointed out that you are a hypocrite. Not only that, but by your own words, you have called yourself one. Why should I listen to anything else that you say? I have not tried to defend anything, except possibly your reputation. I have asked you to provide evidence for your claim that VOR is a hypocrite so that you could avoid being called what you call him. But by your refusal to provide this " so-called evidence, " and that's all it is at this point, I have shown that you have effectively called yourself a hypocrite. This settles itslef if you just back your claim up. You cannot get around the fact that you, by your own words, have called yourself a hypocrite. How does that feel? Woops, I might have just committed the fallacy of telling the truth. Shame on me. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>On the contary, the posts are there for you to find. Merely because you are too lazy to find ( easily ) the many posts where I linked his past doesn't make my arguments " because I say so. " Your laziness doesn't make me wrong. Keep telling yourself that. You don't. You never had to in the first place. Still, you're laziness doesn't make me wrong. Why must I do what I have already done on 40 different threads? Very amusing. This is just my advice : learn what a fallacy is before contesting it. Still though, you have provided me with some amusement. Call me what you wish, it doesn't change the fact that your laziness doesn't make me wrong. Interesting. The plan actually worked. Thank you, I now know how to properly go about when someone who doesn't understand what a fallacy is but uses them reacts when the house comes crumbling down. Very interesting. I wonder if i should use another one on you and see how it works.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>My laziness doesn't make you wrong, but your laziness makes your right? Interesting. I don't need to. You do a fine job of telling me yourself. My laziness doesn't make you wrong, but your laziness makes you right? Interesting. Because someone has asked for it. Besides, if you've done it on 40 different threads, then it shouldn't be too hard to make it 41 threads. Fallacy schmallacy. And your laziness doesn't make you right.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The reason abortion at any stage of a pregnancy is unethical is because you cannot justify killing a human life based on its stage of development...... Abortion has its place. In the need where the mothers health is endangered its completely understandable but its not understandable when its done out of convenience.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>How do you define " convenience "? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>An abortion that is done because you had an unplanned pregnancy is done out of convience. If you cannot raise a child there are plenty of families who will.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I'm sorry you feel this way. How one defines ' convenience ' someone else sees as ' necessity '. I'm sure you can come up with some examples. Like, the very young girls who get pregnant, the rape / incest victims, the financially broke young adults, the women with six other kids, the women who's birth control failed. Please remember that adoption is not an alternative to pregnancy. I know you are only 18 but I hope one day you make your home available to an unplanned child. :) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I understand rape / incest victims. Everyone else took the chance when they had sex whether they protected or not. That is something you have to think about everytime you have sex. Maybe if abbortion wasnt so easy people would be more precautious when they have sex. I'm not a fan of abstinence. I have sex myself not to give you guys too much info. But there is aways away to protect yourself a 100%. If you are on birth control, your wearing a condom, and you pull out you will not get pregnant. So dont give me this sappy story about people making their mistakes because for some who you named if your a single mother with 6 kids you've made a couple mistakes and you'll keep having to live with them until you learn that you can't keep making the same mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes and everyone has to live with them. So stop all the whining about how bad you've got it. You starting building your future along time ago and if you **** it up get over it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>A few comments : You've either got to be 100% pro choice or 100% pro life. Why is the innocent baby of incest / rape any different than the innocent baby in any other circumstance? That is something to think about. Even if you are on b.c., wearing a condom, and doing everything responsibly, you can still get pregnant. What if you took all these precautions and she still became pregnant? What would you want her to do? Your harsh words about women in unfortunate positions bother me. Shouldn't we do something to fix the problems rather than tell ' em tough XXXX? Clearly, a women with many kids needs more help then just turning your back to her. This will only further the cycle.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>As usual I emerge triumphant. None of your inferiors have managed to put up even the slightest resistance to My Superior arguments. I win.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>" Abortion is not murder. Murder is illegal. Since Abortion is legal, it cannot be murder. " That's not a commonly used argument. You're just saying it is because it supports you. It's not the " formal structure. " I don't really have a firm opinion on abortion, but I don't like people with big egos and big attitudes. The " mother's rights " argument is used far more often. Also, by calling everyone inferiors you really seem like a snob. And I read your website. It's a sack of horse ****, and you had no evidence for any of it. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes it is. Pro-WTC murder supporters often claim that abortion cannot be murder because murder is illegal and abortion is legal. Incorrect. It is a formal Truth-based notation of their argument. My " attitude " is just what you see in anyone who has the correct and accurate information. The mothers rights argument is based on human rights. They say that the womb-trapped child is not human, therefore her right trumps the child's right not to be brutally and callously murdered. You are a supreme inferior.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It's not because the Abortion discussion is wether or not abortion should be legal. There are tons of arguments used far more commonly, most often is the mother's right argument. No, you are incorrect. The whole discussion is over wether or not abortion should be legal, not wether or not it is. Big ego is not correct and accurate. You're just a loser who failed in life and now blames society because your frail ego is offended by the thought that you might not be better than everyone else. And it's used far more often the legality argument, which is the point I'm trying to make here. You are a supreme arrogant douchebag failure in life who believes in a bunch of mindless bull**** that you can't prove to make you feel superior to everyone else. Get a life. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Does not matter, you are 100% wrong. Whether or not abortion is being discussed as to whether or not it should be illegal ( only one tiny aspect ), does nothing to negate the Truth regarding the OP. You cannot say that because there are other arguments, that the argument in the OP is not True, it is. You are being illogical and irrational. That argument ( in the OP ) is commonly used. It is false. I know there are OTHER arguments, but that does not change the fact of the matter. You are clearly dumb. You do not meet My Superior quality control standards. Goodbye.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well, I completely refuted you but somehow you're still right. I know that you're too arrogant to do this, but if you take the time to read posts on other threads made by pro-choicers, you will find that the mother's rights argument is used far more commonly. You're talking about something you don't even know what you're talking about. No, you are being illogical and irrational. If you read other people's posts on the issue, you'll find that you're wrong. It is not commonly used, read other people's posts on the issue and you'll find that I'm right. The fact of the matter is that the other arguments are used far more commonly, you're just taking one, less commonly used argument and falsely saying that it's the formal structure of people who have the audacity to disagree with your royal highness. If your head shrinks enough to pull it out of your rectum so you can read what other people say, you'll find that I'm right. I knew you'd dismiss me. Because it seems anyone who disagrees with you is inferior. Using your logic, you are inferior and stupid, and you can't read what I say. I know that no matter how bad I prove the stuff you vomit onto here to be the bull**** it is, you will always accuse me of being inferior.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No, theo, it is not. As I asked Steeeeve, how would you render those passages from Exodus? Keep in mind that Biblical Hebrew is not as scientifically precise a language as English or even Latin.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I don't see how it matters how I render the passage. The only part that matters is that " yatsa " has never and never will mean miscarriage. so how I render the passage could be anything without " yatsa " meaning miscarriage. The most accurate translation I know of is on the website I posted earlier. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You don't have give me your ideas as to how the passages are best rendered. I have already given you the number of meanings that    yatsa    has, chapter and verse on the number of translations from    begotten    to    carry    to    go       bring       forth   , etc, etc. You insist that you know exactly what the writer intended in those passages. I am saying most scholars agree that they are ambiguous. I agree with them. If you know exactly how it should be translated, I was just curious for you to present it. You are the one who is saying there is one meaning and only one meaning to those passages in Exodus. I am the one saying they are not clear. If you won    t present exactly what your version of the words is, there is no more for me to say.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>none of the things you said were miscarriage... so can it be safe to say that " yatsa " doesn't mean that. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I truly don't understand your point. When a pregnant woman falls down the stairs and looses the child, I consider that she miscarried. Do you?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>the point is, if " yatsa " doesn't mean miscarriage ( and there is no indication it could or does ) then you can't really use Exodus to support abortion. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I have been saying that all along Steeve. You can't use Exodus to support abortion and you can't use it to condemn abortion. That has been my point. It is too vague. I asked a question in good faith so that I can understand exactly what you mean. I asked : When a pregnant woman falls down the stairs and looses the child, I consider that she miscarried. Do you? It is not a trick question. I already gave you my answer, I consider that a miscarraige. I hope you will answser because I truly am at a loss in understanding some things.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Yeah but you haven't been saying that all along. But thats neither hear nor there. If a women falls down and looses the child ( I assume you did mean looses and not losses ) then I would say this is not a miscarriage as the baby did not die. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>If I had been unclear in saying that previously,, but I will review my posts to see where I was confusing. Also, I was unclear in the question. The question was acually taken from a discussion with minister. If I were to put put the question in my words I would ask, " If a pregnant woman falls down the stairs causing the death of the fetus, I consider that she miscarried. Do you? " Sorry for the lack of clarity.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Clearly changes the question because " looses " is actually a word and doesn't imply death at all. If the baby dies because of " spontanous " acts ( such as falling down the stairs or the baby just dieing naturally in the womb ) then I believe the qualifies under what a miscarriage is. I also am assuming she did it on accident. Even if it wasn't an accident I believe it is still called a " miscarriage " but I don't think it is a spontanous abortion but more like a planned abortion. Hopefully that makes sense. http://www.teenwire.com/infocus/2005...iscarriage.php <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Thanks, Steeeeve. You make perfect sense. Miscarraige and abortion have the same consequence : the pregnancy is over. There is the additional element of " intention " that changes the meanings. I had other thoughts about this, but maybe later.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>To me it is all about intention and consequences of the intentions ( in a general sense ). Some say the intention of abortion is not to kill the baby but to free up the womans life. Maybe that is her reasoning but her intentions are selfish ones. And selfishness at the expense of anothers life is not gonna fly with me.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Well if you want the end result of pro-life to be " government imposing " then my end result for pro-chioce will be ranking humans like Hitler did. Your end result will always be ranking one human over another. But why do I have accept the consequences of my position but you don't have to accept yours? You want the government to support the killing of innocent humans and you want the government ( and others ) to rank peoples worth. I've accepted my strawman consequence.. will you do the same?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Steeeeve : Because that is what grownups do, Steeeeve, accept the consequences of our words and actions. We don    t avoid the hard questions, we face them and address them. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Look as you selectivly quoting again. I want everyone to how you mis-represent just about everything... Besides the disregard for forum rules, you are just flat out lying. And once again, you " avoid the question " I hope my fellow forum posters will read this and realize that mis-quoting is wrong and I hope they will condemn what you do.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Grownups take responsibility whether others do or not. That was the point of my quoting you and my response. I quoted the only relevant phrase,    But why do I have accept the consequences of my position    the    but    doesn    t matter. Grownups accept the consequences of their positions no ifs, ands, or buts. As far as calling me a liar on numerous occasions, I suggest you stop slandering me. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Well if the shoe fits.... You mis-quote me, say I didn't answer question, and misrepresent my position. That qualifies as a liar to me ( but I am not going to say you are one ). Not only this, but it looks hypocritical if you are not answering any of my questions. I will ask it again. Do you believe in ranking humans like Hitler?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I never said that so I never thought you were posing the question to me, Steeeeve. The answer is No. I repeat No. When I ask someone to repeat the question it is usually because I missed it in the postings or didn    t understand it. You    re use of the word liar is a personal attack and should stop. I quote what you said that I responded to. I clarified it in an additional post at your request. Your tactic of personal attack to distract from the weakness of some of your positions won    t work Steeeeve. It is very transparent. And before you start accusing me again, why not ask pertinent questions or make substantive statements and request replies? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So you admit that when you said http://4forums.com/political/showpos...33&postcount=9 You really didn't know if I was avoiding the question or rather missed it / misunderstood it? If you admit that you did not intend to misrepresent my post then in my next post I will correct myself in saying you were mistaken and not lying. However, there is a difference when someone says " I don't believe I should have to accept the consequences of my position " and " why should I have accept the consequences of my position when you don't do the same yourself ". The second implies that the other person is making a double standard and does not imply ( or say ) that I don't believe I should accept the consequences of my position. You clearly made it seem like I don't believe in accepting the consequences of my position and thus it seemed to purposly mispresent my position..o r lie as it is commonly called. If you can't see how it is twisting the facts then maybe you shouldn't be posting on these forums.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>At your request I clarified my statement. At your request I will clarify further by stating I did not intend, nor did I try to misrepresent your post. Will you apologize for slandering me by calling me a liar? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>It would be nice for you to re-quote me in previous posts... but since you say you did not try to misrepresent me, I will take your word on this and apologize for assuming you were lying.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I would say we see it a bit different... 1. The government has a the right to stop one human from killing another 2. The government does not have the right to stop one human from killing another<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And how would the goverment do that? ( in accordance with the subject of abortion only ) By... Why not just admit it, and move on? You think the government has the right to impose mandantory gestation and forced childbirth whereas others, like myself, think / know that women have the right to make a decision about what to do with the human growing inside her? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I actually looked in this whole thread and did not find a question mark typed by you. Can you just admit that you feel the need to rank humans like Hitler did?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I beg your pardon, I didn't know Hitler had an abortion. P.S. Godwin's law. You lose. Also, you didn't answer how the gov't would do this : Wouldn't they have to by this? I don't understand how that's hypocritical, nor do I understand how I " misrepresented your position ". How do you disagree with the above quote by Howard Beale? Honestly, I don't get it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I just decided to make a strawman like you did. You lose? Grow up<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I didn't make a strawman, I stated facts. Please reread my previous post. And yes, under Godwin's law, you lose the argument. Why do you respond with emotionally charged comments instead of answering the questions? I'm actuallly on here to learn something, not to insult people that don't agree with me. You and I have had this happen before where you jump to defensiveness where it is not needed. Do you have a response for my last post? How was I hypocritical, and how did I misrepresent your position? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>If you didn't mean to misrepresent me then I am sorry. However, stating " You think the government has the right to impose mandantory gestation and forced childbirth " is emotionally charged and thus can become a strawman just like being comparing your view to Hitler. Your comment is not a fair representation of the pro-life message. Could you state it like you did? I suppose so, but then I can state your message as ranking humans like Hitler did. While accurate it doesn't really protray the actual view very well and it comes across is a wrong way.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>How is this statement : " You think the government has the right to impose mandantory gestation and forced childbirth " emotionally charged? Isn't that exactly what anti-choice people work for? Isn't that exactly what will happen if the anti-choice sentiments make it into law? On the other hand, I, as a pro-choice person, do not work for " ranking humans as Hitler did ". That is the emotional response. If you want to go head to head with facts, you'd be better off with a statement like " you ( I ) believe that women have the right to kill their offspring as they grow inside of them ". I would go along with this, as would ( I think ) almost every pro-choice person. I could give you an example of an emotionally charged statement that is anti-choice in nature, but they involve cattle and deities and all kinds of stuff we've heard before. :) I'm trying to avoid it. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>It is emotional to say " government forcing... " because you are trying to make pro-life something it is not. THe whole purpose of you stating it the way you did was to get an emotional response. The fact that you think it is just about having the government force things upon people shows that you don't get our position. I really mean this too. If anything, atleast understand our position as I try to understand yours. I realize your position is not all about " ranking people " but if I did then this would show how I don't understand your postition at all. Perhaps you would like me to PM you what pro-life is really about.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Isn't that the result of the pro-life movement ( " gov't imposing... " )? And no, the whole purpose of stating it that way was not to get an emotional response. It is factual and what will happen if anti-choice gets it's way. I understand that that is not what the anti-choice / pro-life movement is about, it's about preserving life, but that is the end result regardless. Just like the pro-choice view isn't about killing feti, it's about choice, but that is the end result regardless. No one ' wins '. You are more than welcome to PM, but I think others would benefit from hearing your points as well. Thanx! :) <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Well if you want the end result of pro-life to be " government imposing " then my end result for pro-chioce will be ranking humans like Hitler did. Your end result will always be ranking one human over another. But why do I have accept the consequences of my position but you don't have to accept yours? You want the government to support the killing of innocent humans and you want the government ( and others ) to rank peoples worth. I've accepted my strawman consequence.. will you do the same?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>There are any number of reasons why a sexually active woman might not use contraception. Some valid and some borne of ignorance. As far as being abstinent as a sure-fire method for not getting pregnant, I doubt this is acceptable to most modern women. Pregnancy as punishment is a poor way to bring a life into this world IMO. Pregnancy is not indicative of promiscuity either. I don't know what truth is, I only know when what someone is saying isn't.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Pregnancy is not a punishment. Even if it were, I would rather be brought into the world as a punishment than to never be brought into the world at all. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It would be difficult to make this observation given the latter scenario.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It would be difficult to make this observation given the latter scenario. [ / quote ] What scenario is that? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Firstly, the punishment I meant was to the mother not the baby. Secondly, if you were never brought into the world, you'd have no opinion on that fact either way.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I am perfectly aware of that. Pregnancy is not a punishment. You would have no opinion regarding whether or not pregnancy is a punishment? Is that what you mean? If so, somebody not having an opinion on something does not make anyone else's opinions false. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Being denied access to abortion when dealing with an unwanted pregnancy and forced against your will to carry to term amounts to punishment. Punishment for what? For having sex of course. The real issue for moralizers. The opinions of folks who never existed trouble me little. Methinks you're being pointlessly argumentative.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I did not say it did. I said that SCOTUS can strike down State laws that violate constitutional rights in response to you saying that States can do what they wish regarding abortion. Obviously they cannot if a woman has a constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What a confusing statement then. Your statement is so obvious that of course someone would look farther into it. Yes, if something violates the constitution then the state can't make that law. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>One would indeed think what I said was obvious. However, what Cone said was as obviously incorrect so such an obvious statement was needed to counteract it.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>they can do what they want regarding abortion as it is not in the constitution. He was not incorrect about that. Saying " the state can create laws against speeding " is not incorrect eventhough you don't include " unless it violates the constitution "... it would never violate it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Oh Steve. Steve Steve Steve. Abortion obviously has been a Constitution issue for many years now. It obviously has been considered a Constitutional right for a woman to have the freedom to acquire one. Whether you agree with that or not, that is the truth in practice. Therefore, obviously, States cannot " do what they wish " regarding abortion. I doubt Cone needs, wants or appreciates your help. Hopefully not.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I looked again today, abortion is not in there. However, if you make stuff up in a magical world, I suppose it is there. I think the US Tax code contains a right to abortion as well... since I say it does then it must! I agree that states right now cannot do what they want... however, if we actually thought words had meaning they, in theory, they can do what they way regarding abortion.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Maybe not, but again, wheat IS NOT TOAST, and should not be treated as such. Then every sperm is sacred, huh? You miss the point. Cake batter IS NOT CAKE. Period. What you're proposing is we take a big ball of cake batter, smother it in frosting, and serve it at a child's birthday party. It is not cake, and most definitely should not be treated as such. How many fairies can dance on the head of a pin? Lemme go grab a copy of Harry Potter and start quoting it. Once you provide solid proof of that bible quote and the truth of the bible I'd be happy to oblige.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It was a simplistic anedote... but since you cannit even get that, why bother. Sperm in and among itself is not an issue, niether is the egg. I noted that and made it abundantly clear that it isnot until those to come together that we have the orgins of human life, which deserves to pretected from the behavior police. No, that anolgy was highly accurate to the point... you have no cake without all the developing stages that bring the mixture to the point where it cane become cake, parsing it won't help you... for the love of pete, trying being honest. Oh, well I guess you're not into parsing what constitues dessert... at any stage. Well... you said it, not me. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You are correct. Why bother making lame analogies? Why do you believe that a mixture of sperm and egg is more deserving of rights than both separately? You still miss the point. There are many things needed to produce a human, just like there are many things needed to produce cake. Without sex, there can be no human, yet you do not legislate a certain number of times a couple must have sex. Why is that? Only a fool would claim that I posted a bible quote.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Because even simplicity escapes you. Why do you ignore the fact that is the begining of life and is deserving of protection from bad judgement errors? I am not missing any point... you keep dodging the point, and think splitting hairs is an actual argument. The last part of your comment simply made no sense at all... and don't know where you were trying to go with that? We can all have faith and hope for the best for you, but I never said you did. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>[ QUOTE = Darn Republican ;3 34098 ] Because even simplicity escapes you. [ / quotes ] If that's your idea of simplicity then I guess you're correct. Why aren't sperm? They're alive. DR's logic at its best here. When I can't understand something he said, " simplicity escapes me ", but when he can't understand something I said, it " makes no sense ". Talk about not making any sense...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>True... Yeeeeah, you get a cookie today! But they in themselves cannot produce human life. Niether can the egg from the woman. Because you can't expect a reasonble mind to keep a straight face with the " logic " you present... and I just tell it like it is. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>They themselves are human life. They are alive, and the contain human DNA. That's all you lifers need. Again, a great retort from DR! Wow, you got me there.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Ok, and your point is? If you are insinuating [ in your typical jocular, immature disposition ] that sperm cells need to be protected themselves... you are being facetious. Present something people can take serious... other than your feelings. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>What makes a zygote more deserving than a sperm cell? You don't say! Thank you for summing up my opinions on your comments.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I'll tell you this, the zygote is looking smarter than you everytime you open your mouth - at least it doesn't question the obvious. A sperm hasn't itself fertilized anything... <br><b>S1:6-  </b>If you had the intelligence of at least a zygote you'd realize that not once have I opened my mouth while typing. And why is fertilization significant?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>You know what I meant... it was an expression. But I really don't need to know if your mouth was open or not, way too much information. You're joking right? Fertilization is the catalyst for the beginning of human life, but you of course knew this.... rrrrrright?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>They themselves are human life. They are alive, and the contain human DNA. That's all you lifers need. Again, a great retort from DR! Wow, you got me there.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You think GAMETES are living human organisms? You get an " F " in biology, shutterbug ; stick to Papparazzi. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You think cells aren't alive? Looks like my photographic ability is not the only thing you're wrong about. There's no point in debating two ninnies who lack basic biological knowledge.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Oh really? According to the laws of biology, living things : 1. Exist at the Cellular level 2. Are organized in their structure 3. Use energy 4. Grow and develop 5. Have specialized tissues 6. Regenerate 7. Are autonomous, not part of something else, and 8. Maintain homeostasis While gametes are somewhat organized and use energy, they fail of the remaining 6 factors. They are not even life, let alone living human beings. Seems YOU'RE the ninny. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And saying this, you are aware that sperm are one celled organisms? And where did you get those criteria? A fetus surely isn't organized. As far as I know, the only criteria of life sperm does not meet is the ability to reproduce. Disqualifying it as life based on that is as ridiculous as disqualifying infertile humans as alive.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>NO, they are NOT organisms. They are GAMETES -- and gametes are not organisms ; rather, they combine to CREATE organisms. College biology class -- unlike you. An AMOEBA is organized. " As far as YOU know, " is a pretty short trip. Nice to know your two-cents ' worth, which still leaves change one can rub together. I'm sure the entire field of biology will be thrilled at your breakthrough announcement, waiting with baited breath * GUFFAW* <br><b>S1:4-  </b>They are Gametes, but this does not disqualify them as organisms. They are made up of one cell, and they have one purpose. Lemme guess. Prestigious Christian college where they teach you about how the world was created 6,000 years ago and everything revolves around the earth? I'm not quite sure what you mean by organized. If you mean organized socially, then June bugs would be disqualified as organisms. By now I can tell that your opinion of your own intelligence is great enough to build a statue. Sperm - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia " The term sperm is derived from the Greek word (             ) sperma ( meaning " seed " ) and refers to the male reproductive cells. " Looks like someone beat me to it.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Er, nope. Gametes aren't organisms ; whatever legend you are in your own mind, the field of biology says diffo. No, actually they taught the state-of-the-art field of BIOLOGY -- which again, does NOT include gametes as organisms. Yeah, sure. That's what I meant, organized socially. Gotcha. Not " organized, " as in the sense of having ORGANS. At least I know that GAMETES ARE NOT ORGANISMS -- which puts me above you. STILL doesn't make them organisms. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Not according to biologists in this solar system. Right, and I'm sure you learned how wrong Copernicus and Galileo were as well. Lemme put this in simple terms. Sperm = Cells Cells have organelles. Done. If that were true then I would have to have the biological knowledge of a fetus. Cells aren't organisms?

Once you provide solid proof of that bible quote and the truth of the bible I'd be happy to oblige.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The problem with the analogy is that the embryo is a developing human being, just as an infant is a developing human being. This cannot be said of fingernails, hairs, tumors, or even sperm. There is a clear and unmistakable difference between a human embryo and human hair, and to fail to acknowledge that is a gigantic mistake in this debate. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No, the infant is a human being. It may still be growing, but that has nothing to do with being human or not. A baby and an adult are simply different. The baby is not any less than the adult. The fingernails etc. have one major similarity ; they do not mentally exist. While there may be physical differences between hair and an embryo, mentally there is not.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The infant is a human being at a particular stage of development, just as a human embryo is a human being at a particular stage of development. This is confirmed by science, as has been pointed out in this forum multiple times ( e.g., here, and here ), and has conveniently been glossed over by many of those who claim to base their view on science. Whatever that means. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It is a human body in development, not a human being. The term " human being " contains the word " being " which implies that someone " is " or exists mentally. Don't get them confused. I don't know how much clearer I can be. A fetus, just like a fingernail, does not exist mentally. There is no person inside of a fetus, just as there is no person inside of a fingernail. I would think it would be quite obvious. No person exists inside the fetus, and since no person exists, there can be no person. This isn't a deep and complicated philosophical question.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I am not getting them confused ; I am merely using the scientific definition. I might add that science does not denote a human embryo as " a human body in development. " No, science says, " A zygote is the beginning of a new human being ( i.e., an embryo ). " Thus, if I am confused, it is only because I stubbornly refuse to ignore what science has to say. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Science says it does not possess a mental existence. That's all I need to know. They call it a fetus and not a kid for a reason.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Now I know what it feels like to be a black person in the south. I'm talking about the death penalty and unjust wars. Two things that conservatives don't pay much attention to, despite their massive waste of lives and tax money.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>< Flush > There's never been a war you far-left loons have ever thought was justified, except your all-out assault on God, truth, and the American way. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Why is something that cannot be proven the " truth "? And isn't the " American way " all about freedom? Freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of choice, freedom of expression, etc., and not religious rule? World War I, Vietnam, and Iraq, all undeniably unjust wars, unless you have information I am unaware of.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I served two tours in Vietnam. It was a just fight against enslavement by a ruthless, evil, Marxist Leninist regime who is still oppressing the South Vietnamese people. I'd go back again if we would fight it the right way. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>What's the right way?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Increasing force in all theaters of operation until they give up the South. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Do you really think that would've happened? The Vietnamese were and still are a proud people with a strong sense of nationalism, and they fought hard for their freedom from the French. As Ho Chi Minh said, " You can kill ten of my men for every one I kill of yours, but even at those odds, you will lose and I will win. " We had already bombed the living hell out of them. We dropped more bombs on that little country than we had in all of WWII combined. Vietnamese support for us was falling rapidly, especially after incidents such as My Lai and the Tet Offensive. We bombed them, shot them, captured them, napalmed them, and did many other things to them. We DID kill 10 of their men for every 1 they killed of ours, and yet their will remained stronger than ever. You simply can't fight an enemy with that kind of determination. We're learning that the hard way again in Iraq. How do you fight an enemy that is unafraid of death? Short of killing every last Vietnamese, I don't think any amount of force would've won the war.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Judging from your views on the life of the unborn that is great to hear........<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And you wonder why she told you to, " go to hell? " <br><b>S1:2-  </b>And I told her to save me a seat and those goes for you too.........<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Honey, I am just content to call you a bastard. I don't care where you go in the afterlife, provided that it's not in the same place as me. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>First, I ain't your honey........... Second, you don't have to worry about that because I am going to heaven and you my friend are going to hell........ Oh and I would not be a bastard if you kept your mother off the streets........ Now since you can't conduct a civil debate except to call name and insults you are on my ignore list.......... Even " Little Man " has not made it........... :)<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I already got my handbasket purchased. I'll be where the party's at. :p As far as insults go, this one makes no sense, except in your little mind. And I made your ignore list? Finally! I am getting somewhere!<br><b>S1:1-  </b>There is your opinion.. It is not the opinion of most people of faith.......<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Fortunate then are we that the truth of the matter lies not in opinion but in fact. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I just know what my faith teaches on the subject........ no more no less. I consider it fact you don't........ That is life in the big city........ On judgment day you will find out if it is ok to murder the unborn or not..... I already know.........<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So I don't know the teachings of the Catholic Church on the sanctity of life? How do you figure that I don't know them? They're so straight-forward that even the laity can understand them. Also, Halifax is a big city? You live and learn. Funny you should mention that, but God already told me that we must respect the autonomy of the mother, even at the expense of the child's life. Also, about Judgment Day. God mentioned that you might not want to hold your breath unless you want it to come early this year. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Halifax, what part of Philly is that? :) I am ready for judgment day.......... As you know the bible says that death comes like a thief in the night....... Well maybe your bible does not say that... sorry........<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The nice part. I'm surprised that you've even read the Bible. Presumably you're commenting on 1 Thessalonians 5 : 2, wherein Paul admonishes the Greeks to be watchful for the coming of God? The funny thing is that all of my Bibles say that. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Refresh my memory, Does you bible say its ok to indiscrimnately murder babies in the womb?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>My Bible? There's only one Bible. However I don't think I've ever found a passage in the Bible that's about abortion, either for or against it. Exodus comes down hard on the extermination of hebrew newborns, but those are babies already out of the woman and ready for a fulfilling life of slavery. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>We really are going around in circles on this........ My bible through the RCC and Jesus Christ says all life is sacred including that life in the womb.........<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I do have great compassion for unwanted children that can't be adopted but that is a whole another thread........ It is a red herrung.......... That is not the problem with new borns............ Here in the U.S. there are long waiting lines to adopt newborns, some up to 5 years.........<br><b> S2:1-  </b>While I'm sure that's somehow relevant to you, if not to me, you still haven't answered my question. Is all life equal, or not? Whichever way you answer, please reconcile it with your previous allowance of abortions where the pregnancy results from rape. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I will try this one more time..T he baby conceived in a rape life is just as important... This baby did nothing wrong....... It deserves life and i would hope the mother would carry it to term but if doing that endangered her life by causing her to attempt suicide or to have a mental breakdown then I would understand the decision to abort...... I would not like it but I would understand.... If you don't understand that then I don't know what to tell you.........<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Okay. But here is the quandry : The baby concieved through rape is just as important as that which is not. Correct? You would understand if a woman wanted to abort a baby concieved through rape. Correct? Why then, can you not understand if a woman would want to abort a baby not concieved through rape? Take a moment to answer, and try to make your answers consistent with your previous statements. It seems to me that you admit that the baby is important, no matter what. And that you then go on to say that it doesn't matter how important the baby is, if the parents want to, they can murder it. If that is so, why should rape be the only qualifying factor? Why is it only acceptable to abort a baby concieved through rape? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Because there is no rational reason to do that.......... A headache, or a bad day at the office. or for birth control is not a good enough excuse for murder........... Of course you don't believe the fetus is a living being so it is useless to debate with you......<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But VoR, if all life is precious, there can never be a good enough excuse for murder. Even if the baby is concieved through rape, if it's life is percious you cannot murder it. End of story. There are certain socially sanctioned forms of killing. Killing in self defense, or the defense of another, killing during times of war or as punishment. But these aren't murder. If abortion is murder, there can never, ever be a good reason for it. Not at all. I believe a fetus is a human baby, a live and living being. I just don't care. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Again if you have to chose in the case of the mother's life being endangered you have to choose the mother............ Well its a good thing your mother did not have a bad hair day when she was carrying you or you would not be here to debate.......<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Like a rat in a cage he scurries about, dodging questions :p He has no argument, only emotional rhetoric.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>More name calling............... Is that all you have? so sad............. Oh by the way I rarely respond to " Little Man's " tripe and he knows that........ It goes back a couple of years........ He already knows my views on all those questions but like a broken record he just keeps asking them over and over again........ <br><b>S1:2-  </b>When you scurry about and dodge questions, that's what it reminds me of :) All I have? You can't seem to answer what I have.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>your only interested in murdering babies in the womb........ <br><b>S1:3-  </b>* sigh* Can you actually construct an argument, or is all you have emotional rhetoric? Can you answer any of the questions posed to you? So far you have not.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I am sorry but murdering a baby in the womb is a very emotional issue for me unlike you............ What question was that? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Other's have summed up a couple questions I have. Namely : If all life is equally precious, what allows you to choose the mother over the fetus in the case of rape and / or the life of the mother being at risk? and what makes a non-rape baby any less precious then a rape baby if they are both life? A logical argument, please.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>A bacteria... im sorry, what would the fetus be classified under in science?? Oh right, a human... we got that whole " homo sapian sapian " deal going :). Not only that, didn't they have a baby born at 3 - 4 months? I can't remember that actually.. i will look it up. Either way, this arguement is done all the time and there are many things that refute it... so not need to get into it.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>He was refering to a fetus ' parasitical nature, not it's classification ( per se ). <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Granted, however, I wouldn't want my mom calling me a parasite... although I can't really speak for everyone<br><b> S2:2-  </b>A born child, such as yourself ( I'm assuming ), does not have the same parasitical nature that a fetus does. Your mother feeding and caring for you is voluntary ( since she could have given you up ). <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Having sex is voluntary too..... And old people are parasitical on the state ( with social security and medicare )... we should kill them :)<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Being pregnant is not. We should have the right if they lived off of our bodies as a fetus does against our will and without our consent. That is a red herring. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Actually being pregnant is a direct result from having sex. For example, if you enlist in the army and end up getting killed you can't say " i never signed up for getting killed "... well, ya did, you knew what you were getting into when you did it.... as to the second part.... you did consent as stated.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>If one fetus will jeapoardize the life of three ( itself, it's mother, it's already born sibling ) - then just what do you suggest? Letting everyone bite it and suffer in the name of your cause - just so you and your misogynistic brethren can continue your unhelpful women hating? Who said I wasn't moral? Who said I was promiscuous? Neither of these things are true. Even if I were married I would be safe - I don't want more kids. I am pretty sick and tired of you and VoR. All I have asked of either of you is to acknowledge that the reasons women abort are real and serious and that maybe we could do something about abortion by helping them. But neither of you will do that - you insist on your demonization of women faced with that choice. You even demonize me - and I have never had an abortion, haved busted my XXX for my son, and am responsible in my sex life. But no way can you guys acknowledge that - VoR takes all I went through to be able to have a baby and turned it into my not having had a " bad hair day " and now you label me as promiscuous and immoral. What a pair of hateful bastards you are.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And I have acknowledged a couple of your reasons for abortion but I will never acknowlege abortion for convenience........ You seem like a good woman who is leading a good moral life.......... How you can be so adament for abortion for any reason is beyond me.......... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>How you can continue to see the health, educations, finances and other resources of women as mere frivolties that she, any children she may have, and any baby may be carrying don't need is beyond me.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>How you can not see that except for the health issue al of those other things can be overcome......... We are talking about a human life here......... <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Excuse me? It figures I would have to point this out to you - but in a pregnancy - at the very minimum, we are dealing with TWO lives.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>That is so very true but how can you trivulize the one in the womb? Why can't you have compassion for both.......... I do......... <br><b>S1:4-  </b>No you don't. Demanding pregnancy be continued at any expense short of death - regardless of who it may hurt and what may be lost - is not showing compassion for women. It's alwfully brave of you to be willing to sacrifice a total stranger's health and income without her input - and then to dismiss why and how that may hurt her and her family. When I told you my story and what I went through when faced with an unplanned pregnancy you trivialized and insulted me. I see nothing from you that even remotely resembles compassion for women. As a matter of fact you are one of the worst misogynists I have encountered.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>What about the death of the baby in the womb? Oh and I never trivulized your situation.. I commended you for what you have done........... <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Really? I remember quite clearly you posting that my choice was based on not having a " bad hair day. " And anyway - what do you care? - had I been to turn to the likes of you I would not have been able to make the choice I did since you adamantly refuse to acknowledge that anything is an issue.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I did not say that was your choice.. What I said was there women out there not like you that do have abortions for convenience..... You can not deny that...... I apologize if you thought I was pointing you out.......... That was not the case........<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The hand reached out and grabed the doctors finger... You mean to tell me thats not a person? From that website : " By 15 weeks, ultrasound reveals babies moving in reaction to something as simple as a mother's laugh or cough ".<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Its likely reflexs if the brain isn't showing activity in the right places as well, especially when you consider the what the fetus will be responding to in the case of laughs or coughs - its not hearing the sound but being compressed by the movement of the diaphram. A lot of movement ( probably the majority of it if we take into account moving to balance weight and smooth muscle stuff as well ) requires no concious control from the brain at all, and in many cases you won't even be aware its happening. Don't forget that on top of this there are a lot of instincts babies have as soon as they are born that then are replaced shortly after, grabbing things is one of them. Though I don't know quite what the level of brain involvement is when it comes to instincts. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Is this based on you guessing or do you have any backing for what you said here?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Not quite a just guess, but what I would assume was the case if the brain wasn't showing any ( let alone higher ) activity in the brain. Its the case with with more traditional reflexs like recoiling after touching something sharp or hot, or when your leg moves when the knee is tapped ( which is one the balancing ones I mentioned ). On top of that there are the frog leg and lizard tail examples. The laughing and coughing on is almost certainly going to be a reflex ( you don't conciously move when you are poked or prodded unexpectedly, the signal doesn't even go up to the brain until after the movement is complete in these sort of cases in adults ), the grasping one I'm less sure about as I don't know entirely where instinct works within the brain. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>ok? I am not sure what your point is with all of this...<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It was in response to you saying that brain activity occurs early on the pregnancy, whilst there may be some neural activity and even brain activity - it doesn't require there to be a mind, or even for the body to be alive in some cases.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>not if the other will die.... even so, that is wrong. I was referring to where one was the dominant<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Umm actually they can, it called a parasitic twin. Parasitic twins are removed all the time and left to die. Why would you consider it wrong? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I am talking about walking around conjoined twins where one is the dominant.... stop stalling Because you are killing a person.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Here is an article on parasitic twins. http://phreeque.tripod.com/parasitic_twins.html So you consider removal of a parasitic twin wrong? Do you see the picture of the lady with the three legs, one of the legs is not hers if she had that leg removed would that be wrong? Would that be murder? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Why do you keep on talking about something I am not? You can look up the types all day long here : http://www.conjoined-twins.i-p.com/ The point of the matter is, it is unethical to kill one conjoined twin to let the other be " free "... unless you support killing some people, which it seems you do.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Why is it okay with you to get rid of a parasidic twin and not a conjoined twin. How did you make that dermination? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Who said I said that?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>So which is it then? Is it morally permissible to remove a parasitic twin? If not why? If yes Why is that different from removing a conjoined twin? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I just want to know why you assume things I didn't say. Things like that make me not take you seriously. As for your question, it would bepend on the situation I presume.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Okay both situations are done for convience. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>That's nice... Are you going to expand on this?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>But you're completely missing the point. Although spanking meets the definition of assault, calling it " assault " would be a gross exaggeration, don't you agree? The same way calling spanking " assault " is an exaggeration. Parasite : An organism that lives in or on and takes its nourishment from another organism. A parasite cannot live independently. Sounds pretty accurate to me. Plan B/ Morning after pill. Oh, but it did. We're obviously talking about abortion when we say " choice ". This is the abortion forum after all. " Pro-life " is just as vague. Why aren't you complaining about that?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yes, I agree. It just makes a lousy comparison to the topic. Calling levonorgestrel a contraceptive is incorrect, its not a less exagerated replacement for abortion. Your right, I stand corrected. It is a good example of an exaggeration. Unfortunatly, those terms don't tell you what levonorgestrel is, were back to vague again. For instance, Keflex can be rightfully called an antibiotic. Calling it an antibiotic tells you what Keflex is / does. Calling levonorgestrel " plan B " isn't very helpful. Look back a few posts, I already said I also think " pro-life " is too vague. " Anti-abortion " makes much more sense. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That was my mistake, I should've called it something like Plan B, which is a less exaggerated replacement for abortion. Calling orange juice " Sunny D " isn't very helpful either. It's just a name, not every product must be called by its scientific definition. Then I stand corrected.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Your helping my point here. " Sunny D " is the product name, but, calling it orange juice isn't an exageration because thats what it is ( taking your word, I've never had Sunny D ). Calling " Kleenex " facial tissue isn't an exaggeration because thats what it is. Calling " Levonorgestrel " an abortion pill isn't an exaggeration because thats what it is. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>But " Sunny D " is not exaggerating orange juice. " Sunny D " does not describe something else more accurately, as abortion describes the procedure performed by an abortion doctor, not a pill.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>" Sunny D " is a trade name, so is " Kleenex " and " Levonorgestrel ". Calling " Sunny D " orange juice is an accurate way to describe the product ie. " Sunny D is orange juice ". Calling " Kleenex " facial tissue is an accurate way to describe the product ie. " Kleenex is a facial tissue ". Calling " Levonorgestrel " an abortion pill is an accurate way to describe the product ie. " Levonorgestrel is an abortion pill ". The description is accurate, succinct, and precisely describes the product. It is not an exaggeration and any attempt to claim otherwise at this point is willful ignorance. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>When I say abortion, what do you think of? Do you think of taking a pill? When someone says " I had an abortion ", nearly everyone assumes you went to a doctor and got the fetus removed, not taking a pill. When someone says " I drank some some Sunny D " or " I used a Kleenex ", we know exactly what they are talking about, the words don't have any alternate connotation like " abortion " does. I'm not disputing that " abortion pill " is an accurate description, it is. It's just an exaggeration, and exaggerations are always accurate to some degree. When we start calling Levonorgestrel the " abortion pill ", it gives the anti-abortion crowd leverage to ban it, when in fact it prevents much nastier abortions from occuring and keeps women safe from back-alley abortions. So lets just call it what it is, Levonorgestrel, and forget about it. There are much more important things to debate than fussing over the name of a freakin pill.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Perhaps if the abortion supporters arguement is damaged by their opponent using the truth, its time to re-think their position. " Prevents much nastier abortions "?? If I was an abortion supporter I don't think I'd use this line of reasoning. The " lesser degree of wrong " argument seems flawed from the start. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>If by " using the truth " you mean " bending the truth without breaking it " to vindicate your position, then yes, that is what you do. Exaggerations like that distract us from argument, and are an attempt to sway the reader without making any valid points. Here is an example of more pro-life falsities. They think we love abortions, when in fact we don't. We hate them. We just have the sense to know that forcing women to carry an unwanted fetus inside of her body is far more disgusting than any abortion could be. Everyone choose to have unprotected sex. Your mothers did.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>A couple of points need to be made : 1 ) First, though I agree with you that people should act more responsibly where their sexuality is concerned, it should be pointed out that, as Simone implied, when you only criticize one partner, it does seem that you are presenting an illogical double standard of morality. Such a double standard would then make readers lose respect for your moral stance. 2 ) Even anticonceptive precautions fail ~ 1% of the time so responsible sexuality does not guarantee protection from an unwanted pregnancy. 3 ) If, either through irresponsible sexuality or bad luck of failed contraceptives, a woman gets an unwanted pregnancy, then the decision of whether or not she should be allowed to get an abortion should not depend on how she got pregnant but on general factors of rights of woman over her own body vs potential rights of the fetus. Indeed, if a woman did get pregnant through irresponsibility, then that would only ADD to the arguement of her getting an abortion since there would be a bigger risk of her being an irresponsible parent than if she simply got pregnant through bad luck of failed contraceptives.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I read a study from Australia that said 70% of the women who got an abortion were using the birth control pill. I guess you could say these people are trying not to get pregnant but what I see is that people should know that you still can get pregnant and that you need to know that risk and accept it. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes, people are taking a risk in having sex where the risk is higher the fewer precautions are taken. For example, with no contraceptives, there is a high risk of pregnancy. Using one contraceptive treatment runs a low risk but still significant for frequent enough sex. Whereas, doubling up on contraceptives ( ex. condom plus the pill ) would probably run a very low risk - just judging by statistics alone. For those that think that one treatment is enough ( ex. condoms ), I suspect that they do not take the statistics into account or just assume that they will not be the unlucky 1% that have the condoms fail. Either way, people who engage in sex do need to understand that there is a risk of unwanted pregnancies and STDs. However, the ethical question of how to deal with the consequences of unsafe sex is different than the ethical question of human sexuality. Having an unwanted pregnancy certainly puts a woman in a very difficult position, but I would contest that keeping the child is the only responsible alternative as, I would guess, you would claim. Abortion is also a responsible alternative - depending on the situation.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I am saying that the measures a person takes to not get pregnant are irrelevant to the debate on abortion. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I did misunderstand your post, then. Yes, I would agree that the measures that a person takes to not get pregnant ( or indeed any aspect of their sexual lifestyle ) are largely irrelevant to the debate on abortion. Of course, I am sure that we continue to disagree as to what the viable responsible options are when it comes to handling an unwanted pregnancy but, as you would agree, that discussion is independent from the discussion about the responsibility people have to not get pregnant in the first place.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Actually I think we agree on the responsible options for handling an unwanted pregnancy. Basically we both feel that once a human is valued ( I use value to mean something like it has a right to live ) than the responsible thing to do is care for the baby until born. The difference seems to be what is valued ( again I use that term very broadly ). I think a human is always valued while you give value to some level of brain function. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Yes, I would agree that we both do set limits on abortion rights once the human is valued. However, I would state my view as only valuing human bodies once there is a " somebody " in them. Since I view the core of the existence of people as their mental existence then, yes, in our current understanding of the source of mentality, that involves sufficient brain function. However, if one could prove to me that a mental existence could exist without brain function ( ex. a soul ) then brain function would be irrelevant. It is the mental existence I value - the mental existence that determines the existence ( in my view ) of a person. Brain function is secondary and important only in the sense that it achieves that mental function. Unless I have misunderstood your view all along, you value human bodies whether or not they have " somebody home " - it is the human life itself that you value, not any existing mentality.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>That is a rather stretch of the word. You have to take a definition of atheist and then define a word in that definition to come up with that. I personally wouldn't find that to be an accurate definition but you can use it if you want. Semantics. It isn't an improper use of the word. What does it matter to you? That's fine but you still don't get to define the argument between me and another member of the forum. I could care less whether you wish to join in or not. Yes.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>As long as we clarify that the word " baby " in these cases refers to a fetus, then I don't care. But in this context, I think we should be as clear as necessary. If the discussion is about the difference or lack thereof between a fetus and a borne offspring, then don't use the same damn word for each. Even if I'm arguing that five is the same as schmive, calling them both " five " just makes it impossible to follow the discussion. Fine, then I'll hold you to reasonable standards in your discussion with me instead. How is this not a fallacious appeal to authority? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It refers to what it refers to. I don't think you can easily take it out of context. I don't go around thinking you refer to a dog fetus when you say fetus. The context is known by simple reading comprehension. It is apparently clear everyone knows what I am talking about. No confusion was shown. born and unborn work just as well. There hasn't been a problem yet. Seems saying one or the other is more qualified would be an appeal to authority. Moral decisions are decided by a certain group of people unless you can establish an absolute moral right that only they know. I guess the better question is how IS that an appeal to authority.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Then let's use those. Comments like these are the ones that really make me wonder if you're as familiar with debate as you've claimed to be. A soybean farmer is not an authority on ethics. An ethicist is. Appealing to the soybean farmer on the topic of ethics is a fallacy ; appealing to an ethicist on the topic of ethics is not a fallacy. What group is that? Who makes that determination? Who decides what people get into the group? Are you arguing that such a beast exists? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>This isn't true unless there is a predetermined standard of ethics and morality out there by which only a few have studied. Since this is not the case ( to some extent ) and it is all based on belief then the soybean farmer is just as relevant in the discussion as the ethicist. An ethicist has no better judgment on abortion than the soybean farmer. An ethicist has no better judgment on right vs wrong than the soybean farmer. That should have said " are not ". So it should have read : " Moral decisions are NOT decided by a certain group of people unless you can establish an absolute moral right that only they know. " Without that " not " it really makes no sense. I do argue it exists but I also argue that there aren't certain people that can " know " it better. It is a belief structure. I would say an appeal to an ethicist is an incorrect appeal to authority because they have no authority to decide right vs wrong.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The three-fifths clause declared them " persons. " There we go again, we crazy liberals " rewriting " history by citing the Constitution. One could say the same about any science. We technically accept nothing as infallible, but that doesn't mean that we accept what Joe Schmo off the street says about quantum physics. I question the assertion that ethics is " all based on belief. " Let us suppose that this statement is true, but that no absolute morality has been established. Why, then, should Washington bigwigs have any moral authority regarding issues that don't affect them? Why shouldn't the decisions be made by those people the decisions actually effect? Which sounds to me like an argument that Mr. Washington Bigwig shouldn't force their moral decisions upon the populace ( e.g. stem cell research, abortion ). A scientist doesn't " decide " what is right or wrong, but a scientist has examined the evidence and comes to a reasoned decision based on more extensive knowledge than the soybean farmer. The same could be said for ethicists and ethics. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Are you trying to tell me the constitution treated blacks like persons? Are we really having this conversation? morality is not a science and science does have a standard by which to judge. It is impossible to prove something is good unless you have a standard by which to judge good and evil. This standard can be nothing more than belief. I think it would be hard to show otherwise. Why do you think morality falls under philosophy? Assuming no moral absolute? If you assume this then there is no reason why you should or shouldn't. Murder, stealing, animal cruelty. Those too. using phrasing like " Mr. Washington BigWig " is borderlining on a logical fallacy by tainting the water. A scientist has a standard by which to judge... the ethicist does not unless the ethicist has concluded a moral standard and if there is a moral standard then the soybean farmer would still have just as much room to talk on the matter. The reasons for this are vast but in short, morality is not an observation or investigation. Morality is the conduct of the people to right and wrong. I can take this one further as well and say my morality by definition would not be known ( or have the ability to be known ) more to an ethicist than to a soybean farmer.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Because you know the human embryo and fetus is a human being? Fallacy aside, that does not fit the definition so no. The unborn does fit the definition and is therefore a human being.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Really? But my definition of a human being includes the trait that it is an organism with a physically independent life. Since a foetus cannot survive outside its mother's womb, until fairly late in the pregnancy, and indeed from a biological perspective could be regarded as parasitic, I don't see how it is reasonable to regard every foetal stage as a human being the way you would regard a human infant as a human being after birth. Frankly, I think it's insane to think this way. There was no tradition, religious or otherwise, of making this absurd claim, till fundamentalist Christians got going on it and created it out of thin air. But then, that's fundamentalist Christians for you : human rights begin at conception and end at birth. After that, the kid and mother are on their own. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>A parasite has to be an entity of another species by definition. There is also nothing in the definition that requires one be self sustaining and if this were true a newborn wouldn't fit the definition.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, they don't. They aren't physically independent of their mother ; they aren't sentient and self-aware. Your liver cells meet your criteria. Oh? Really? Since when did you become such an expert on the biology of parasites? A parasite is an organism that derives its sustenance by exploiting another living organism during its life. It doesn't have to be a separate species, just a separate individual. Of course, the definition of a foetus as parasitical is a little tongue-in-cheek. It's just that the foetus is genetically distinct from its mother, and shares many of the same properties as the usual parasites, in that it's totally dependent on its living host. It's totally dependent on its mother, and therefore cannot be regarded as a separate organism with rights of its own that supersede the rights of its host. A foetus does have certain rights, but so does the mother. You lot refuse to recognise the mother has any. To you lot, every mother is no more than an incubator. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Physically independent of the mother, sentient, and self-aware are three things not required to be a human being. An entity with human dna is all that is required. Your liver is part of an entity and not an entity itself. Well using your definition ( which is wrong it does have to be a different species ) then you just admitted the fetus is a separate individual did you not? Dependency is not a criteria for obtaining rights. A new born is 100% dependent but they have rights. Of course you would just throw in random charges creating a fallacy and a poor argument.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>A liver can be transplanted, it can be kept alive outside the human body. So can human cell lines. A flask of human cells is packed with human DNA, but not even the pope would claim it's a human being. At least, I hope he wouldn't. So yes... physical independence and sentience are required for a definition of human being. It's an individual organism, though it's organically wholly dependent on its host. That doesn't make it a human being in any objective sense, using a definition based in part on sentience, which is in my correct view, essential. Of course they do. But a baby doesn't have a parasitical existence, it's a completely, physically separate organism. Anyone can look after it. Foetuses have fewer rights, however, in part because of their total, physical dependence on and umbilical attachment to their host, and in earlier embryos, because of their lack of sentience, or even a brain to be sentient with. A post-natal baby is not the equivalent of an attached foetus in the womb. Even a non-biologist should be able to tell the difference.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>some of you are trying to push the fact that it is ok to abort babies, and I still disagree, it is murder and I can not bring myself to believe other wise. I know that my bible teaches of the value of life at the moment of conception, and I believe my bible, and my pastor, but most of all I believe in my heart that abortion is murder. I think some of you need to look at a bible and do some soul searching, I am not the hateful one here.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It's OK to have opinions. Any opinion. However, the point of a debate forum is to make a logical argument upon which those opinions are based. Having an opinion " just because " or " because my pastor said so " or because " I believe in my heart " is open to criticism in a forum such as this, unless you also supply a reason behind those ideas. Also, I think that's a rather irresponsible way to go through life. If we don't think these things through, we have no basis upon which to make decisions when faced with novel information. Doing something solely based on another's urgings without examining the underlying reasoning is childish behavior. On reason you did supply is " I know that my bible teaches of the value of life at the moment of conception, and I believe my bible ". Where does it say that in your bible? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>THIER ARE SEVERAL VERSUS, SUCH AS THE 10 COMMANDMENTS, THOU SHALL NOT KILL OR COMMIT MURDER, CALL IT WHAT YOU WILL. AND JEREMIAH CHAPTER 1 VERSE 5, SPEAKS OF THE VALUE OF LIFE IN A SENCE. THIER ARE ALSO VERSUS THAT SPEAKS OF COMMITING ADULTRY AND HAVING SEX WHEN YOU ARE NOT MARRIED. IF A WOMEN IS HAVING SEX SHE SHOULD BE MARRIED AND SHE WOULD NOT HAVE TO HAVE TO MAKE THESE CHOICES OF BRINGING BABIES INTO THE WORLD WITH NO FATHER. FURTHER MORE PARENTS SHOULD BE TEACHING THIER CHILDREN GOOD MORAL VALUES AS CHILDREN SO THEY DONT MAKE THESE MISTAKES IN THE FIRST PLACE. I KNOW I DO. IT IS CHILDISH AND IRRESPONSIBLE TO PUT YOURSELF IN IDIOT SITUATIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE DONT YOU THINK?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Your first post did not address my post in any way. The second sorta touched on it. I would appreciate if you could supply the passage itself rather than just the reference. In addition to merely spouting bible passages, you should express the ideas in your own words as much of the bible is inscrutable to me. Please tell me why you feel the way you do. You say the bible speaks of not harming the unborn child. Please show that specifically. I would indeed also like to see where the bible states specifically that idea that we need to protect the conceptus immediately after sperm meets egg. You say that is the case " if I perceive it correctly ". Maybe you don't. Please provide a logical argument. Thanks for finally losing the ALL CAPS. That was really irritating. Now work on spelling and grammar and it will be much easier to read and understand your posts. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The bible states that your body belongs to God. 1st corinthians 6 - 19 states that your body is a temple of the holy spirit whom is on you, whom you have recieved from god, you are not your own, therfor honor god with your body. A women who is consenting to an abortion is not honoring her body, nor the life that she carries. You shall not commit murder is stated in the ten commandments, and murder can also translate into dash into pieces, which is a very accurate description of an abortion procedure. Exodus 23 7 states we should not put the innocent to death, well a fetus is an innocent. And off the subject sorry about my grammer I usually use a spell checker.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Looks like you failed to support your contention, and I asked you to supply passages / text with your interpretations, not merely citations. Your answer is that the body is a temple of the holy spirit who is " on me " ( whatever that means ), and is not mine, but god's. Fine. From that you extrapolate that abortion is not honoring one's body. There is no mention in that passage about a fetus. I could go on. I asked you a simple question. Twice. You have been unable to support your assertion that the bible states that we must protect the zygote immediately after conception. I thank you for your response, your avoidance of upper case, and your better attention to spelling. You needn't respond again. It appears you are not interested in a dialogue, but merely restating your original points without being willing to defend them by answering questions put to you. Thanks anyway.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Here's the picture of the aborted babies in the garbage can. And here's the complete link :<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The Newfoundland & Labrador Right to Life Association is a known religious propaganda site. Wouldn't put it past them to Photoshop those pictures just for ' shock ' value <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Thanks for contributing absolutely nothing as you make unfounded claims without supporting them with even the slightest proof. But hey, talks cheap ; and you've proven you've got plenty of that since showing up here.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That's right it is, so if those pictures are real and not just propaganda then you should be able to back up that they really existed. Surely you can support your ' claim ' by showing everyone a newspaper article, police report or other legal document for them breaking the law by disposing of human remains in that fashion. We'll wait for you to back up your claims. Like you said, talks cheap, Photoshop costs some bucks though ;) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>First of all, you're jumping to a huge conclusion and making a giant unsupportable leap by claiming that any human remains were disposed of illegally at all. So since you're making that ridiculous claim, it's on you to prove that assertion and then I'll be happy to produce a record reporting it. You liberals are incredible!!! You think you can just proclaim a law has been broken and then demand proof of it when no law at all has been broken in reality. It's just more evidence of the delusions that have clouded your thought processes.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Sorry but that's not how it works in the real world. Whomever posted the link to the image has the responsibility to prove that the image is legit. Whether that's you or not I don't know, but whomever it is they need to show some verifiable documentation. They can't just post propaganda and claim that the everyone else needs to prove it's propaganda. If it's real then it should be easy to document. No documentation, no legitimacy. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Wrong again ingus. I posted a valid link. If you're going to make wild accusations about its legitimacy, then it's on you to prove it. I stand by this link as valid and accurate. The organization named in it is real and verifiable as legitimate. If you believe these photos are fraudulent, then prove it. Otherwise, stop the denials and accept the cold hard truth of what abortion represents in the real World. http://home.thezone.net/~nfrtla/phot...ted-babies.htm Since you came here, this debate has stopped being about abortion and has degraded to semantics and your attempts to make accusations against posters rather than actually debate the issues we were discussing.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Thier is a big difference between an unfortunant event such as a miscariage and an abortion. And thier are many people who are willing to adopt, my parents have dedicated thier lives to adopting mentally dissabled and troubled children and have made a huge difference in lives. And I dont stand in front of clinics and I am not mean to those who have abortions, but It should be illegal and I will support in making illegal. The bottom line is we all know, including these teenagers that having sex has many consequenses and if you cant take responsibilty then dont have sex. These women are ignorant cowards. You know if someone kills a women who is preagnant that person is charged with not only the murder of the mother but also the unborn child, and a women who has an abortion should be charged with murder and senenced to the max for the simple fact that abortions are a brutal act of violence against a child. And by the way the doctor should be charged to!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Freedom of choice should be illegal? That is pretty warped and asinine. Should it also be illegal for a woman to take vitamins? According to you - yes - because a certain dosage of vitamin C will cause a miscarriage. You'll NEVER stop abortions as they have been happening since mankind has first walked this Earth. One way or another women will control their own bodies regardless of slavery nazis like yourself who try to control women, and only see women as being invisible. Wow, what in your head makes you think that's OK? First of all it isn't murder, so please learn the very basic definition of the words you ' try ' to use. Secondly, according to your so-called reasoning, if a woman dies while giving birth then the baby should also be sentenced to the max for committing her murder. Deal with it. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>OK, well freedom of choice is ####, We do not have freedom if we kill someone and I beg to differ but abortion is murder, and a very brutall murder at that. If a women does not want a child then she should close them legs and keep them that way. If her life is in danger then again keep those legs closed, adoption is a great choice.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I'm sure our founding fathers appreciate your ignorance. Maybe since you don't appreciate freedom of choice you should move to russia where you'll get a refresher course on its importance You can beg all you want but it does NOT meet ANY of the terms qualifications. Deal with it. In society you can't just make up your own definitions for words like you do. Do you know what they medically call someone that makes up their own definitions to words? Psychotic ;) Now you're just being ignorant Thank God for Karma and the fact that people who think like you usually end up having a bad life from all the bad energy generated around them. How poetic <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I am not the one having a bad life, I did not abort my children. As far as freedom goes you dont have the freedom to kill your neighbor, but the freedom to kill your child<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You can't say that as there is a lot that can happen between now and when it ends. One thing that I know is true, no one, not even you, can out maneuver Karma. All of that bitterness that runs through your veins, all of that hate for fellow adults, all of that justification for all of those lies that you try to convince yourself of, all of that poison in your head that makes you think that you can selfishly control another person... it all adds up in Karmas eyes, and as usual Karma will win. Looks like it sucks to be you, as God sees nothing wrong with abortion, as he causes them through miscarriages everyday of the week Earth to Christina, this is a forum about medical abortion. NO ONE is killing their " neighbors " <br><b>S1:4-  </b>you are correct this is about abortion, my point is we do not have the right or freedom to kill one another, so how can a mother havethe right to kill her child? And I am not a hateful person, I do not hate one who kills her child, I only wonder why she is so hateful and selfish. And God has the right to take these innocent lives, we do not.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No there is a difference and trying to say that allowing abortion will lead to the ' right ' to terminate children after birth is just ridiculous. Once a woman CHOOSES have the baby she has assumed certain responsibilities. Once she takes those responsibilities she must legally and morally uphold her end. Of course, she could give the baby up for adoption or whatever. But this initial choice is the woman's. Once she does choose to have a child she MUST take care of it or face the consequences. But because of those consequences ( and the physical ones as well ) the woman must have the opportunity to make that choice of her own free will.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why can't it be said that choice is made prior to having sex? What about if a woman had no choice for 9 months after birth? In other words, adoption wasn't available. Would this same rule apply? Seems given the first quote you would say no because all of a sudden an obligation is there. So what is the standard here? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>[ QUOTE ] Because women have every right to enjoy sex, just as men do. However, there is no 100% certain method to ensure that she doesn't get pregnant. To say that a woman MUST give up sex as the only way to 100% be sure that she won't get pregnant is unjust and creates a lower caste system for women. I'm not sure I understand your scenario. But at some point in the pregnancy the woman decides she's going to have her baby ( right now it is the limit at which to have an abortion ). After choosing to carry on past that time, she assumes responsibility for the baby.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Every standard you come up with is arbitrary with no logic. It seems like you have the solution and are creating a standard to get that answer. Why is " choice " not allowed after birth? What changed? If one does not to believe that all persons deserve equal rights then you open up the idea that any person can have rights removed for whatever reason. In this case I do argue a slippery slope because there is no instance in human history where declaring people unequal is justified ( and before we get the " what about criminals " argument let me say I believe they have equal rights because they were treated the same as anyone would have ). Why can't this be after birth? I disagree with the idea that this comes down to a woman's right to anything. I am of the idea that we all get equal rights and equal treatment. At no point would any " right to one's own body " outweigh a right to life when those two are at odds with each other. It can't because this doesn't apply across the board meaning another standard is used to degrade an unborn person. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>[ QUOTE ] What are you talking about? You said that simply having sex = the choice to be responsible to carry a baby for 9 months. I said that that's not correct. That women have the right to have intercourse without having to be afraid that they'd get stuck with a baby. No method of contraception is 100% except abstinence. Women should be able to enjoy sex as well as men or we're going to have one of those ' unequal ' situations you are worried about. That choice happens when a woman doesn't get an abortion. By CHOOSING to carry the baby to term, she's obligated herself to taking care of it ( or giving it to someone who will or whatever ) Because that's neglect. But it does. The fetus ( or unborn baby ) can't force a woman to carry it if she doesn't want. The woman must make that choice. Once she does, she's on the hook. Right now there is a time limit in which to get an abortion. A woman must make the choice by then, that is her responsibility. If she chooses to carry the baby past that time, she's made her decision.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The point is that all of these are random inconsistent standards. You think equality is important but only sometimes. You think choice is important but only sometimes. You think a right to your own body is important but only sometimes. All of these " sometimes " just so happen to allow abortion. What is the logic behind these? Why the exceptions? This violates what I said : " At no point would any " right to one's own body " outweigh a right to life when those two are at odds with each other. It can't because this doesn't apply across the board meaning another standard is used to degrade an unborn person. " So what are you saying " but it does to ". You are creating a standard but have provided no logical explanation for it. Is there a reason for this belief or is this just what your belief is? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Wait, wait. You are the one that for twenty posts kept saying ' but pretend that IF unborn were considered people ' and now you are saying that I'm the one saying the ' it does to [ sic ] '. Nice try. The standard is that no person in a free society can have the control of their bodies taken from them to the extent that forcing a baby on someone does. Your saying ' what I said was at no point.... ' Which is your ' because I said so. An unborn baby ISN'T a person ( even if you assume it is ) and even if it were, the rights of the mother always would outweigh the rights of the embryo ( at least to a point after which she has ' chosen ' to keep it ).<br><b> S2:4-  </b>The unborn isn't controlling the woman in a pregnancy but merely is living in the only environment allowable to live. The woman can still do many things granted a restriction is now placed. So what is the standard for restriction? If the burden is caused from a born child and is equal to the burden of a unborn child then wouldn't think standard, if consistent, allow you to kill both? Are you going to say " the woman has accepted the responsibility to take care of the child "? If this is the case then why does it have to be before birth? Where did this come from? Finally, why would a woman be granted the power to bestow rights? Do you prefer unequal treatment? You standard is still seems nothing more than a conclusion followed by a means to get there. I still can't figure out if this is just pure belief or if you have some logic behind it. There is nothing wrong with pure belief but I'd like to ask where it was derived from.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I'm not so sure you can take the DOI to mean abortion is ok. It clearly says " life " and not taking away life. So what is the confusion?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Read the DOI : We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights    It says all " men " at the time they wrote it, woman, blacks, etc were not equal. The same question I asked Chloe : I asked a simple question which you did not answer. Do you believe that the fertilized ovum should be treated like a person, with all the rights that come with that? I'd appreciate a direct answer -- which you have been avoiding since I have asked it. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>you are kidding me right? You realize that " men " was a univerisal ( and still is ) term back then to mean ' mankind '. The founders ( many of them ) actually realized that slavery was wrong and hoped it would be phased out over time... sadly it took a war so they were a little off on that one. When did we not answer this? I believe the answer was yes to the rights question... life liberty and pursuit of happiness are the rights I'm thinking. However, I don't believe a law is a right. The DOI would imply that the fetus would get the right to ' life '. However, I don't think the DOI was referring to abortion at the time written<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Oh I forgot! That    s how they used    men    back then, to mean mankind. Of course they were too uneducated to write what they meant. They were Neanderthals who only spoke in monosyllables. Couldn    t spell mankind, so they used what they could spell :    men   . That    s why women were so equal they couldn    t vote. And they were also visionally impaired because they couldn    t see that blacks were    men    who belonged in the group    mankind   . Maybe they took a vote and 6 out of 10 of them said the blacks were not men and 4 out of 10 said they were so they decided that a black was 3/5 ths of a human. Maybe they were just stoned. That is your typical non-answer. If a fertilized ovum is a person then why not stand up and afford that person all the protections of the law that any other person gets? Why the parsing of your words? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>lets define ' man ' since you are a person of the dictionary : number 2 on the list : A human regardless of sex or age ; a person. any other comments on this? I'm not sure I can make it any clearer than " yes "... how do you want me to respond?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Thanks for the direct answer. I have another question if you don't mind. I am trying to follow through on some thoughts. See where they go. Do you agree that pregnant woman who ingests anything ( alcohol, drugs, poison, etc. ), thereby causing harm ( brain damage say ) to the human fetus she is carrying is guilty of harming a person? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>We already had this conversation. Why are we doing it again? this post answered your first question http://4forums.com/political/showpos...1&postcount=31 As for your second question regarding the women ingestion alcohol.... is she doing it with the intent to harm or not? I know we have been over this.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Without intent -- sort of like driving drunk and hitting someone, you didn't intend to harm anyone, but you did. You know that drinking can harm the fetus, but you drink. You know you shouldn't drink and drive, but you do anyway.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>For the sake of discussion let's say it is the same one all the signers of the Declaration of Independence agreed it was.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And you believe that to be what? You really need to just say who / what you think the Creator is to save us from having to make all these clarification posts. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Do you need to know who / what Benjamin Franklin thought the Creator was to be to discuss the rights outlined in the Declaration of Independence? If he and the other signers thought the Creator was Hamburger Harry does that negate the rights enshrined in the Declaration?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Yes, it is essential to know who / what the Creator is, so we can make sense out of the unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. If we don't know who / what the Creater is, we cannot know what is meant by life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, nor can we know any of the limitations on these rights. And if we do not know what is meant by life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, then we certainly cannot know whether that Creator endowed women with the right to kill another human being. Your position is meaningless until you decide what Creator you think endowed men with these rights, and what behavior is permitted, and what behavior is proscribed, by those rights Join the club. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Then how have we functioned all these years -- unless you know what each of the signers of the DOI meant by " Creator "? Why not open a separate thread : " What did the Founding Fathers mean by the word Creator. " It might prove interesting. This thread is about whether you think the Founding Father's were correct in their statement. I do. Do you?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>What do you mean functioned? Actually, forget that. You haven't answered my first question, so let's just try and stick with that one. You started this thread buster. In it you have tried to make the case that the Creator has endowed women with the right to kill a person. We will only know that this is true if we know which Creator endowed men with rights. The only way you can possibly agree with the Founding Father's statement is if you believe in the same Creator as they did. If you think their statement is correct, then you must know who they thought the Creator was. So, it should be easy enough for you to enlighten us. You know, I find it particularly interesting that you will not answer a question so fundamental to your position as the one I have asked. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Cone : You are saying that you need to know what is meant by the word    Creator    used by our FF before you can discuss the rights they claim that Creator endowed us with. So I asked how the courts could have functioned if they needed to know what the FF meant by Creator as you are claiming you need to. The names    Howard    not    buster   , so chill. The FF said that the Creator endowed men with certain unalienable rights, not me. I just happen to agree with them. It's OK if you don't, but you don't have to be rude. I have answered you question : I believe in a Creator who endowed us with certain unalienable rights. Do you?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Where does the Creator designate a court system? Certainly they had an idea of what the definition of those unalineable rights are. What does life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness mean? What restrictions does the Creator put on those rights? This is why it would be very handy to know who / what the Creator is. Without this, we have no way to define the rights of life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. You answered a question I did not ask.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. ( The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America in Congress July 4, 1776 ) If that is the basis of our rights, then we don    t we need to acknowledge that this same Creator endowed the province of carrying of the fertilized ovum to the female of our species? Don    t we need to trust that decision? Doesn    t taking the position that a government can take that divine endowment of the Creator away from the female of our species is to undermine the very source of our rights.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>1. So... how does abortion ( the taking of a human life ) fit into this perceived nurturing responsibility of the mother? 2. Also, are you against the government keeping a mother from killing her toddler? 3. There is no difference between a mother going against nature by neglecting her innate nuturing responsibility through abortion and a mother killing her toddler except the size and location of the child. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>1. The terminating or carrying to term of a pregnancy should not be ( in my view ) a province of the government. I do not think we should let the government believe that they have the power to force a woman to carry a pregnancy to term or force her to terminate it. I do not think it wise to give the government that power. That is where abortion fits in. 2. Once born a human ( toddler, infant, or elderly ) have the same rights as outlined in the Declaration of Independence. 3. There is a valid point of view that wants the fertilized ovum declared a person. That seems to be what you are saying. Is that your point of view?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>What about doing this in america to an illegal alien? You are inconsistent. You say that a government should not be able to limit the killing of a human life ( abortion ). You say that a government should be able to limit the killing of a human life ( mother killing baby who has been out of the womb for a nanosecond ). Both involve the mother's health. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Illegal aliens are covered by the constitution. It is not limited to citizens, the constitution covers all persons. As far as points 2 and 3, you are correct. I believe that until the fetus is born the Creator has given the responsibility for it solely to the mother. Once a fetus is born it becomes the responsibility of the family and society. You seem to disagree. I asked a simple question which you did not answer. Do you believe that the fertilized ovum should be treated like a person, with all the rights that come with that? I'd appreciate a direct answer.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>If this is true, then it should cover the fetus since there is no difference between the fetus and the infant besides size and location. Every adult was once a teen, every teen was once a child, every child was once an infant and every infant was once a fetus.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>" That because a woman carries a child. " Now, would that be a woman carrying a child in her arms? I believe that the child is protected by American law, indeed, by most civil law around the world. Or, is she carrying a fetus, not a child, in her womb? Which is it?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>There is no difference. Actually, there is about only about 15 inches difference ( arms to womb ). The child in the arms may even be older and more developed than the child in the womb. I guess some people see this as reason enough to kill a child, and this is truly sad. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Fifteen inches difference from arms to womb? Just 15 inches of air space separating womb from arms? Huh? What species are you talking about?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I'll repost. Maybe this time you will get the point of the post. There is no difference. Actually, there is about only about 15 inches difference ( arms to womb ). The child in the arms may even be older and more developed than the child in the womb. I guess some people see this as reason enough to kill a child, and this is truly sad. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You are saying that absolutely the only difference between a child in arms and a fetus in the womb is 15 inches. I must ask you again, in which species? Now, suppose you rip a fetus out of the womb so that it can be held in the arms. Think about it. Think really, really hard! In what species is that possible? What happens if you did that with the human species?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Nope never said that. This is a difference. The only other difference is the size / development. Isnt it interesting that you can have a mother carrying a less developed born baby in her arms in one room, and a mother carrying a more developed human in her womb and having an abortion in the next room. Using discrimination against someone's size and development as a basis for killing them is bigotry rooted in a prejucial dogma of selfish extremism. It happens and it is called birth. C-section is even more like what you just described here. Also, remember the incident in which a woman killed a mother and then " ripped " the live baby out?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I agree with you. Do I want abortion to used for birth control? no... As you say, I agree things need to be looked at on a case by case bases ; thats what choice is unless there are criteria. But again I agree, I can't set the criteria as well. You and I surely don't want the deaths back. Be it 10,000 or 80,000. Clearly we agree. Progress.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Not only is Phyllis right in calling you what you are but you clearly ignore reality. You were already called on using incorrect facts once... you might as well say " denying abortion will cause 10000000 bagillion deaths a day " <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Steve if I thought I could help you I would. I was called on using incorrect facts and your shooting out words like bagillion? You need to know when you in a dream. Reality is scary I understand that. I can't make a blind man see steve, if I could I would. Seems you can't make an aware man sleep as well.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Your post is embarrassing. Would you care to point to a valid source showing your numbers to be correct? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You tell me the numbers can turn your heart and I will. Because one of us can actually be honest and depend on numbers from science and doctors ( all those people out to get you and yours ). If the numbers can change your mind I wouldn't be waisting my time and surely I would.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss4804a1.htm Gee, that is well short of the 8,000 you spoke of. Sometimes you hate to see such a train wreck... a rookie mistake indeed.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No, no you can't. Not by any definition and not by any reasonable method of science and not by pretty much anything other than a bias on your own self.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It is not a human being in the sense of having existence in actuality. There is no one in there. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Only if you define human being the way you feel you want to.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Dictionary definitions are not adequate when discussing fine philosophical points, Steve. They are not human beings in the sense of having someone in there. One can reasonably believe there is a significant difference in the moral status between an two week pregnancy and a newborn. If there is a signicant moral difference it is perfectly consistent to defend the right to acquire an abortion yet oppose infanticide. It is reasonable to hinge that difference upon the existence in actuality of an individual. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>haha, so we should go with your definition?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>For the sake of the argument. It is a reasonable criteria. You seem to mistake my attempt to clarify the discussion with an argument in and of itself. It is not. Your objection seems to be based solely on your inability to make unjustified proclamations using this criteria. It should provide no barrier if you have a reasoned argument. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I'd disagree. I see no reason to have the starting point be based on your own false beliefs.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Reason? Besides, of course, that it would exclude a group you wish included. A better question : If rights exist in our society, what reason is there for my group to be excluded? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>It is no more reasonable than using a dictionary definition. Actually it almost seems less reasonable to use your definition as at least mine was developed prior to the abortion controversy making it a little less biased. I have no one of knowing if your random definition was developed to exclude who you want to exclude. That is a good question. What group to you refer to? Was is the standard that these reasons have to live up to is another question I think is important.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>If my definition is as reasonable as a dictionary definition, what is your reason for rejecting it as I feel the dictionary is inadequate in questions involving complex philosophy? My criteria is hardly random. Consciousness, individuality, is a basic component in what it means to be a human being. Whatever group I am a part of that you would exclude from having rights. " Reasonableness " is an adequate criteria for this point, I suppose. What reasonable reason would you have to exclude any group, that I may happen to be a part of, from having equal rights? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Those may be your thoughts but they aren't mine. Furthermore, I suggest that yours might be worse as it is seemingly biased. Well what is or isn't reasonable? I certainly don't think your criteria is reasonable. Some folks those color of skin was reasonable... some not... seems like an odd standard.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>What inherent bias is there in suggesting that individuality and consciousness is a basic component in what it means to be a human being? On what basis do you disagree? What criteria would a reasonable person have to exlude any group of people from having equal rights? Since our laws are littered with what a " reasonable man " might do, I believe this to be a fair question. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>The fact that you are in favor of abortion limits your independence from the question of what a human is. a discussion on the law is going to be different than a discussion on what is right.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>I am not seeking independence. What inherent bias is there in suggesting that individuality and consciousness is a basic component in what it means to be a human being? On what basis do you disagree? Legislation is the morality of the weak. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>If you aren't acting independent of the question then that certainly brings up an inherent risk of bias. how enlightening.<br><b> S2:8-  </b>Since I am the one posing the question I'm not sure what independence you require :P Come now. On what basis do you disagree that individuality and consciousness is a basic component in what it means to be a human being? As you said, the question of what is legal is and should be separate from the question of what is right. Using legislation as your morality is for the weak-minded. <br><b>S1:9-  </b>You actually weren't bringing up any question. I disagree that consciousness has anything to do with being a human being because that is not what it means to be human being. Human DNA is pretty much the only requirement if you want to get scientific about it.<br><b> S2:9-  </b>Certainly I was, which you answered below. I believe most would disagree with you that there is no quantatative and qualitative difference between a fully functional person and a brain dead vegetable living only through life-support, though both would have human DNA. Yours is the minority view, Steve. <br><b>S1:10-  </b>So what if it is the minority view?<br><b> S2:10-  </b>It would suggest that my criteria is more reasonable, or more appealing, than yours. <br><b>S1:11-  </b>Perhaps more appealing but not more reasonable. I don't even know that your view is a majority view. And you of all people should know a majority doesn't make something right.<br><b> S2:11-  </b>Well, certainly my criteria is more reasonable in the sense that it does not include entities such as the dead and human vegetables, which most reasonable people would agree are qualitatively different from you or I in some way. It also follows the " common sense " feeling that what makes us unique has more to do with our mind, brain, consciousness, etc instead of just our DNA. Your criteria has more problems it must try to explain away than mine in the philosophical arena. <br><b>S1:12-  </b>If mind and brain make up who you are then why does a monkey not get more rights then a mouse ( this is assuming you give rights based on what is a human being ).<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Would it? I am sure that Mr. Gonzales and the current USPOTUS would find a way to make it work. Majority rule after all!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>If you aren't for majority rule then what are you for? Dictatorship? Minority rule? Monarchy? no rule? I mean, give me something here. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>OK try the US Constitution. We are a representative democratic republic not a majority rule nation. Majorities hold certain powers but they are limited. Minorities continue to have rights which may not be infringed by the majority. Amibiguity and sharing of interests in various types of personal and social decisions is a necessary component of this system. We are built on compromise and that has served us well.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>which is pretty much the same thing. The majority of representatives get their way. The representatives are elected by a majority. Being overally picky about it gets you no where... we pretty much have a majority rules nation. And we still haven't settled the question about how you think you can impose your belief on others but I can't. The " convention " idea didn't work, the idea that you aren't imposing a belief on others didn't work, so what is next? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The constitution always overrules the majority and the representatives are checked and balanced in what they may and may not do. Not true in pure democratic rule you know. I am not imposing my belief on you or anyone else so far as abortion goes. Its a matter of individuals making their own moral decisions freely and voluntarily. I neither tell you that you must have an abortion or that you must refrain from one. In what way does that impose any belief of mine upon you? It does not do so.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>the constitution doesn't always overrule a majority and still, the whole system is based on the idea of a majority... and in some cases the " super majority ". But you are. You can't just claim someone is not a person and therefore say you are not imposing beliefs on them. If this were the case then I'd just say you aren't a person and therefore when I hurt you it wouldn't be wrong. Would you agree with this statement? I neither tell you that you must have a slave or that you must refrain from having one. In what way does that impose any belief of mine upon you? It does not do so. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>This of course utterly ignores a third party who is clearly and umistakabely a person - namely the slave. The proper analogous formulation would be - you may be a slave if you choose to but I will not require you to be a slave. You are making ( or imposing ) a dubious assumption that the fetus IS a person and objectively so. Slaves are persons, feti are not clearly persons. You are not logical in attempting to obsecure the primary issue.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>They weren't considered persons then. This was the so called " convention " that you think is important. So I ask again, given the fact slaves were not considered persons at the time would you agree with the below statement : I neither tell you that you must have a slave or that you must refrain from having one. In what way does that impose any belief of mine upon you? It does not do so.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>On the other hand there may well be perfectly valid medical reasons for doing so. For example her fetus may have a sex linked disease or have a high risk of same if its male. What would you say if it turned out that male homosexuality was maternally inherited? If it were and there was a history of males in your family being homosexual, would you consider aborting a male fetus and trying to have a daughter instead?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Perhaps. But that it isn't necessarily the case. And it also depends heavily on how one defines the concept of a " perfectly valid medical reason " for doing so. I suppose you and I will disagree on this point. If you would consider the two reasons you cited below as " perfectly valid medical reasons " for an abortion, than I can say with certainty that you and I disagree upon how such a concept ought to be defined. No. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I am glad to know that you are pro-choice. Nobody would ( at this time ) force you to have an abortion. Isn't freedom wonderful? But now consider that some ideologs would say that having a child who is likely to be a male homosexual is sinful and some of those would if given the chance make your decision for you. They are not pro-choice.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You have no evidence that I am pro-choice, nor do you have any evidence that some ideologues would force anyone to have an abortion in any circumstance let alone the one you have specifically mentioned. Now, if you want to have a reasonable discussion, I am all for it. Otherwise, you can count me out. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Ah but its been done in China for example thus removing choice. And the opposite was done in Romainia you know. All my discussions are reasonable - if sometimes abrasive and Socratic. \<br><b> S2:3-  </b>In it's common usage, a person who is pro-choice supports allowing individuals to decide whether to abort a child or not ( although they are mysteriously not pro-choice about various other things ). Now, when you asked me if I would consider abortion to be justifiable in the circumstance you cited, I said, " No. " That is, it is not justifiable for anyone to abort a child in the second trimester for that reason. You have a knack for shifting the scope of the discussion. I am not talking about Romania or China. I am talking about the United States, you know, the place in the world where abortion has the least amount of legal restrictions. I have noticed that most of your posts in this thread are laced with little but sophistry. For example, just in your last two posts to me you tried to change the meaning of a very common phrase, and you also tried to shift the scope of the discussion. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>First of all a fetus in the second trimester is NOT a child. By definition a child is a human being living outside the body of its mother. Children must be born. Yes you said no and thus exercised your choice thank you very much. For you its not reasonable to abort and you are entitled to that choice. You are not entitled to choose for anyone else however. There are plenty of sex linked diseases which affect only one gender, some of them pretty awful. An abortion of the fetus due to its likelyhood of being badly diseased is rational to me and if faced with the problem I would evaluate the situation as best I could and choose what to do. I appreciate your allowing me to do so as I accord the same right to you. Those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it. Both Romainia and China are relevant to what denial of choice can end up looking like. You are entitled to your opinion IMHO.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You seem to be upset that I used the word " child " in a way you perceive to be uncommon. Interesting. No. I said it would not be ethical for anyone to abort a fetus on the grounds that the child is likely to inherit a particular trait. That's not an exercise of choice. It is the expression of an opinion. And additionally, that opinion says nothing about whether one should be able to exercise a particular choice. I am perfectly entitled to prevent another person from killing a fetus for trivial reasons. You have not given a sufficient reason as to why I may not do this. Actually, you have not given any reason as to why I may not do this. Though it may be rational it is not ethical, and therefore you should not be permitted to do it. Sophistry. It is quite interesting that you have to appeal to the history of other countries. Why is that? Oh yeah. It is because when you examine United States history ( a history that has traditionally prohibited abortion ), you cannot find one example of someone being forced by the government to obtain an abortion. So what you offer is an argument that looks reasonable at first glance, but when it is examined we find it is just sophistry. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>And there we have it. You claim a right which you do not in fact hold. You would force your opinion on others. To what extent would you go? Would you kill the provider of abortion services? Would you bomb abortion clinics? Would you incarcerate the mother in a prison to prevent her from doing whats legal? Where would you sto in asserting your right to prevent what is at this time a perfectly legal action???? Bear in mind that the current law does NOT require any reason at all for a womans choice, it can be totally arbitrary! I can see that you are not interested in being rational, only in being in control of other peoples lives and choices. The voice of an authoritarian raises its head.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>A ) Basic law 101 : you can be driving by the time you're 15 and a half. We are speaking mostly of 16 and 17 year old girls. Many of which cars and jobs. However that is beside the point. I would normally agree with you on other medical procedures, because of these reasons. This is an exception, as I have stated above. This is the case where parents will act more immature by either forcing their daughter to have or to not have the abortion against her wishes.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Well then you should have specified what age range you were referring to. I don't consider it to be beside the point at all. If there's the threat of abuse and evidence can confirm or at least support this accusation, then the authorities should be notified and the abuser removed immediately. Suggesting that parents not be notified because it might lead to abuse is stupid in my opinion. They're going to know something is up when there's a sizable amount of money missing, or if complications arise and hospitalization is necessary. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I am referring to all ages. Its just most common in 16 to 17 year olds. I'm saying that most girls would rather have a dumpster baby or a back alley abortion than report their parents to the authorities. They will cross that bridge when they get there. Parental notification clearly violates doctor patient confidentiality. Even getting past that, the young woman in the situation is better to determine the outcome than any voter. No voter knows a girl's scenario better than herself. She can make the decision whether it is best to tell her parents or to keep it to herself. Another problem that may arise is the girl weighting whether to be parentless and stranded in the ailing foster care system, or just take the pain of the abuse. Many would choose the latter, which is why the importance of the absence of notification laws needs to be understood.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Then you should have specified that. And as we've seen most are stupid. Those that you suggest be protected are below age of consent laws in the first place. That's a rather poor attitude to have. Tarasoff v Regents of the University of California. If there's a significant threat of harm to the individual then the doctor can be held liable for remaining silent. In this case allowing the abuse to continue by not reporting it to the police. That may be true with adults. But children are incapable of knowing what's best for them, and the age of consent laws reflect that. You just said that only the individual seeking the abortion would best know how the situation affects them, now you're saying that a majority if pregnant minors would prefer to stay in an abusive family than seek help elsewhere ; a contradiction to your previous statement. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Sorry. Consent laws are about as effective as the alchohol prohibition, and that's beside the point. That doesn't change the fact that its irrelevant to the discussion. And if the doctor reports it to the parents and the patient is injured as a result the doctor can also be held liable. Some children do know whats best for them, and some parent's do not know whats best for their kids because they may be driven by political or religious motivation. That's the problem with these blanket laws. I don't see how that's a contradiction to my previous statement in any way.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So? Well then the physician certainly has a sticky situation on his hands, what you'd call one of those " catch 22 ", " damned if you do, damned if you don't ", " between a rock and a hard place " situations where no matter what decision you make it's gonna be the wrong one. If the doctor remains silent and lets the abuse to continue he can be liable for any future harm that comes to the child, if he alerts the parents and possibly the authorities then he might be liable for setting the abuse into motion and potentially getting the child killed. Some children jump off of rooftops because they think they can fly, or that an umbrella will work like a parachute and break their fall. Some children think that they can be professional wrestlers just like the people on TV and wind up killing their younger siblings in tragic accidents that could've been avoided. Then you're not looking hard enough. Either the situation is unique and nobody but the individual in question can know how to best handle it, or the situation is simplistic and anybody can tell what will happen and what's best for everyone. Which is it? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>They don't work and are therefore irrelevant to this debate. Exactly, so stop claiming one scenario is better than the other. Some adults ruin their children's lives by forcing them to have a baby. Man, you're really blindly searching for something, aren't you. Where did I say this was simplistic?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Irrelevant or not, they're still the law. Aren't you doing the exact same? Yes and some don't. Remember that. First you claimed that only the woman seeking the abortion could possibly know the best for the situation, that no voter could ever comprehend what would be going through her mind. Then you claimed that a child would rather live with abusive parents that beat them instead of running away for their own safety, as if you know everything that goes through their minds, or like you can predict the future and know exactly what will happen. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>A different law. Are you sure you're in the right debate forum? No, you see I'm advocating for the person that has to deal with the situation to decide for themselves. America is so great. But some still do. Remember not to screw them while making laws. You misunderstood. I said meant some if not most children may choose to take the beating instead of lose their only parents. In any case, this is not a situation we want to be putting young women in.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I am for notification on other medical procedures, however abortion is different. There are many parents out there who are more immature than their daughters, and are abusive. Parental consent is not as much about a parent's right to know a it is keeping young women out of harms way. Unfortunately, not all minors are as mature as I, and not all parents are as good as mine, and therefore it would be dangerous to pregnant adolescents to subject them to this kind of potential harm, as AO mentioned. This is also a highly controversial issue, and it is not right to forcibly subject a minor to the political views of her parents.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>If a child comes in for an abortion and fears abuse from her parents then law enforcement should be notified. The only people protected by opposing notification laws are abusers and pedophiles. No elective, invasive medical proceedure should be performed on a child without the consent of a parent or judge. If a minor is allowed to have an abortion without consent the parents / guardians will have no idea whats been done to this child should complications arise, they wouldn't be able to give this information to a ER doctor or the childs pediatrition. I've heard this type of statment before and it doesn't seem to hold water. Opposing abortion is not a political view, its a moral view and children are subject to their parents moral views from day one until they are adults. Its called parenting. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Wrong. The people who are opposed to notification laws are trying to keep our young girls safe. A child may not want to tell law enforcement about her being abused because of fear of her parents. The only people who support notification laws are affiliated with the coat hanger companies. I agree, however this is a rare and serious exception. Children don't fear abuse, or their relationship with their parents being complicated from your garden variety surgery. No, its a political view. Something that the whole country is deadlocked over is not a " family value ". No one should be forcibly subjected to anyone's political view, regardless of what name you may give that political view.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That doesn't even make sense. How do you help an abused young girl stay safe by making sure the abuser doesn't get reported? Putting the abuser in jail is what will help that girl stay safe and reporting the abuser to law enforcment is what will put them in jail. Lets say the 14 year old girl was impregnated by a pedophile, your theory is definitely going to be to his liking. Complications from abortion are hardly rare. As to when a child fears abuse, your giving abusers way too much credit. Your implying that there is some logic to the abuse. They don't need a reason, the fact that it's a day ending in Y is good enough. I will go so far as to say its both. In my case for instance I oppose abortion ( in most cases ) on a moral level. Because of that I also oppose it when I'm voting. These two things are not mutually exclusive. The bottom line is this : A child that isn't mature enough to decide to see an R-rated movie is certainly not mature enough to make major, elective, medical decisions. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I want to know how giving her abusers more reason to abuse her makes sense too. Lets say the girl was a victim of incest. With that logic, why don't all abused kids immediately report their parents? Complications from not having an abortion are just as common. I'm also saying that a young woman being abused would most likely rather stick a coat hanger up her vagina than report her abusive parents. The opinion that abortion is a moral issue is also a political view. Of course they're old enough to see R rated movies. How many kids over 12 do you know that haven't? I would normally agree with you, however this is an exception. In many cases, the parents will act just as if not more stupid than the parents. We also must separate this debate from the debate that of whether abortion should be legal or not. This debate is soley to determine the best course for our young and pregnant women.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Couple of problems with this statment. First, abusers don't need a reason. Second, if the abuser is reported to law enforcement it would make her safer then allowing the abuser to remain anonymous and free to abuse again. Lets say she is. Why are you so determined to make sure he gets the chance to do it again. If law enforcment had to be notified in lew of parents they could put the pediphile under the jail. Because they are kids. They don't know any better. Which is why we should be doing everything possible to see that law enforcment gets involved. Speculation, any evidence to back it? Your big mistake in this statement was the word opinion. For me, and many others, abortion is a moral issue, no opinion about it. I agree, it would however seem to me that you are having a hard time seperating the two. You agree that children are not mature enough to make decisions about elective, invasive medical proceedures except in the case of abortion. Read : except where it differs with your " political views ". I have come out consistantly on the side of notification, if not parental then law enforcment. I base this argument on the childs maturity level and ability to make medical decisions, as opposed to " political views ".<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Unfortunately for you archie that's not how a debate works.

Also... dont ' blindly accuse me of not being open minded - conservatives are some of the most [ truly ] open minded people are around..<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It is precisely that supposed " knowledge of what is right " that makes conservatism so repugnant. The right " reasons " deductively, while progressives reason inductively. The right keeps prating about universal ; progressives know there are few if any. Also, if conservatives are so " open-minded ", where are the gay ones, the pro-choice ones, the affirmative action ones, the progressive taxation ones, the atheistic ones? For that matter, where are the ones who can spell? I have corrected your misspellings. You post as though you think others here are stupid. Give us a break! <br><b>S1:2-  </b>And this rant by you... only made sense to you. Chester... I don't think liberals are stupid, they just show us everyday they aren't smart... tomorrow's a new day buddy. How about some of that change Kool Aid you're probably high on. Secondly " opended minded " doesn't mean open to depravity... it is just more co-opted language by the left. See minds like yours believe emphatically that to be open minded [ to you ] is to lower the standard. No, it is not... But to answer your question, there are gay republicans, haven't met a gay conservative yet... but there are gay republicans. Tammy Bruce... Al Rantel, the Log Cabin Republicans [ go figure ] - see we can almost all get along! Lastly... right and wrong is not a concept that can be bartered in the halls of academia or in the back of coffeehouses, it is a universal understanding... the knowledge of which is written on all our hearts, we know right from wrong and the voice in American politics that lauds lawlessness can't lie to all the people all the time. So once again you proven to the world you a the living, breathing 2nd law of thermodynamics.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Since you are so sure that universal ideas of right and wrong exist, kindly post a single example of an act that has been considered wrong at all times, in all places, and by all people. If you can't do it, I suggest you retreat back into your Randian cave. :) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I just bet you thought you were smart just now? I'll go you several... How about : 1. Murder 2. Stealing 3. Adultery 4. Rape Almost every culture since the dawn of civilization has put to death those who have trespassed those basics. But I guess you didn't get that on the Recovery Channel huh? Your idiocy is profound only as your ignorance.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>1. The Death Penalty is judicially supported murder. 2. Jean Valjean proved the idiocy of this. 3. Jewish law at one time required brother #2 to impregnate the wife of brother #1. 4. In many societies around the world ( The Scottish clans spring instantly to mind. ), and up until recent times, men were required to abduct their wives and, whether the women involved were willing or not, to have intercourse with them. What is it with you members of the hard right religious radical lunatic fringe that you cannot engage in debate without resorting to anger and ad hominems? NEXT??!! <br><b>S1:4-  </b>to support the nonsense you believe is so socially valuable... Now let's pick this lunacy apart point by point. Wrong : Government absolutely has the right to evoke a death penalty for those crimes it deems neccessary. Secondary to that point... I bet you support abortion though? confused... Who gives a flying left toenail about what French relativist thinks? I am not bound by Valjean's humanistic machinations. Unliess you are living as an Orthodox Jew, or Christian... don't quote what you dont ' live for. You have no clue what you are talking about... so zip it. That statement is irrelevant to the whole point. Like Chris Rock said... there are some things I'm liberal about, and something I am conservative about. I can be completely candid there. But the one thing I cannot be liberal about are things that effect society as a whole... you on the other hand just have a hole in your head.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Not irrelevant at all, silly child. You posted four of what you thought were universals. All that I di was to show that each and every one of them is not as universal as you thought they were. Your argument stands demolished!!! Thus proving once again that neo-conservatism is bankrupt. BTW, do not tell me it " zip it " unless and until you can demonstrate that you are the net nanny. Your final statement once again proves what right thinking people knew all along ; scratch a rightie, find an angry hater every time. BTW, Lincoln should have thrown Robert E. " Traitor " Lee in the brig the second he resigned his command to commit treason against his country. At least he lived long enough to see his slave plantation confiscated for a cemetery for those who diesd to help put the traitorous South back under the Federal boot. For the good of the USA and to prove that Americans are forgiving people, our leaders might be getting around to pulling Federal troops out of the traitorous South sometime soon.. The Southerners needed a proper chastisement for having the temerity to commit treason against their country.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>If this is the assumption... The choice would actually be, " have this child now, or kill her in order to have a different child later. " In the progression of every life, circumstances will appear that the person may not have wanted. Suppose Alice and Bob desire to have a child, but only if it is a perfectly healthy male. Suppose also that Alice and Bob are fortunate enough to get what they want ( because everyone is entitled to have everything they want, right? ) Suppose further that five years down the road, their perfectly healthy child develops a chronic illness for which much resources will be required to address. Are Alice and Bob justified in killing their child? They did not want an ill child, but that is what they now have. Why should Alice and Bob not be permitted to kill this chronically ill child? For the pro-life community, the issue comes down to the fact that every human being has intrinsic value and worth, and their life is valuable for its own sake, and not for any benefit they might bring to their parents, their society, or any other person. This is ultimately why arguments of social utility fail to persuade pro-life individuals that unrestricted abortion is not only acceptable, but is often preferable.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That's one interpretation Here's another : " Have this child now, or remove the wad of cells so that you could ( if you wish ) have a different child later ". Of course not, it's ALREADY been born. Gee... that was an easy question to answer See above. Really? ' cuss what I always see with anti-choicers is that they seem to think that the pregnant woman is invisible. This means that all men and all fetuses have a right to life at all times, but women, for some unknown reason, seem to lose that right when they become pregnant. Weird. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Perhaps you didn't read the initial post, where it was explicitly assumed that the conclusion followed " even if you wish to consider a foetus as a living organism. " By living organism, the poster appears to mean " a human being, " since there is no dispute among anyone as to the fact that the fetus is a living organism. You only see that because that's what you want to see. I am pleased to inform you that you happen to be seeing lies. You are confusing the right to life with the right to liberty.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No I can pretty much guarantee you that I don't want to see that, as it is disgusting the way you anti-choicers treat woman. Before this thread is finished I'll be able to quote one of you subconsciously showing that you think the woman is invisible. Nope. Try again. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You have demonstrated that you do not know how the pro-life community treats women. No, you probably won't be able to. Yep. It is true that pro-lifers do not remove, nor do they seek to remove, any pregnant woman's right to life.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I've been involved in this topic for over two decades. For you to assume what you have only demonstrates your naivety. LOL Good one :p <br><b>S1:4-  </b>What is terribly naive is your assumption that your own limited personal experience with, and observation of, the pro-life community gives you the ability to justifiably make sweeping generalizations about pro-lifers as a whole. I notice you are not making an argument. That is very telling.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Because your facts are so backed up. Look, this discussion has happened a million times on this forum and anyone with any kind of objectivity has agreed that at the very least using the term " a human " is not inappropriate. If a human can be defined as " belonging to the species homo sapian " than a fetus is a human being. And when numerous sources are quoted to you, you turn and run saying 1998 is too long ago. Seeing as you are all about having " facts " to back things up, it is surprising to me that you have yet to provide any while Chloe has provided numerous.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Really? Should be easy for you to post one example of a human having a heart rate of only 3.3 beats per day like a ZEF does ;) Oh and we're still waiting for you to answer our last question. Come on stevie, these questions should be soooo easy for you to answer IF you are right, but for some odd reason you are not posting examples as needed. LOL <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Seems you just did give an example. Thanks. Where did you ask me a question?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You need to PROVE your claims stevie. That's how a debate works. What is their name? How did you medically document that this fully grown human being had a heart rate of only 3.3 beats per day? I think you know you have painted yourself in the corner and now you are just trying to be cute with your typical anti-choice word games. Sorry, but it don't work that way in the real world stevie. As they say " put up or shut up " but quite wasting everyones time ;) Post 57. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Likewise. Prove that a human being is defined the way you think it is. " Put up or shut up " remember? The waste of time is me addressing this about once every 3 months for those XXXXXX that show up and think they know everything but then realize they have no answers ( as Another Opinion.. who is pro choice... has shown ) so they leave. In any event, a simple dictionary shows that the word human or term human being can be defined as ' homo sapian ' and since a fetus is a homo sapian ( and not another species ), one can easily say a fetus is a human. This is really not in dispute. In fact, the mountains of evidence presented before you from others is just written off by you showing your ignorance. What are you asking in this post? Are you asking if I really think that? If so, than yes. You can now stop the smart XXX attitude and actually address posts with real answers. It is bad when people on your side are calling you out on it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So that's how you prove your point, by asking OTHER PEOPLE to prove another point? If you can't show us one example of a human being having a heart rate of only 3.3 beats per day like a ZEF does, then I'd say your proof is non-existent at best ;) Oh I remember, and I also plan on reminding you of it everytime you sound nonsensical like archie. LOL ;) Simple dictionaries are for simple minds, and too bad for you they are not recognized in a court of law where the definition of a ' human being ' is quite different. Guess that's why you anti-choicers lost Roe v Wade. LOL :) Good. Now where's your PROOF? Post one example of a living human being having a two chambered heart like a frog. It should be easy for you to do if you are right. " Put up or shut up " remember? ;) <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Please provide evidence that human is defined how you define it.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>So that's how you prove your point, by asking OTHER PEOPLE to prove another point? All you've proven is that you believe in hogwash.

Repeatedly posting the same childish response PROVES that you are wrong. Let me clue you in on something stevie, in a debate forum such as this unbiased documented fact rule. Childish dogma like you've been posting here only makes you look like a troll <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Please provide evidence that human is defined how you define it.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I could start by the fact that to deny that moral objectivity exists ( or to deny the possibility that it could exist ) is to utter a logically contradictory statement. I shall take the following statement as representative of what I mean : " There are no objective moral truths. " The problem with that statement is that it is self-contradictory. It is a claim about moral truth that must be objectively true to have any meaning. But if it is true, it cannot have any meaning. If it is true, then the statement logically must be false. Now, I don't know your view on this idea of moral relativism. I do not know whether your view is the strong relativist position ( there are no moral truths ) or the soft relativist position ( there may be moral truths, but we cannot know them ). It is very hard to have a discussion about any subject with a person who adheres to the strong relativist position because he already demonstrates that he is willing to dogmatically adhere to a self-contradictory idea. If one is willing to embrace a contradiction here, what is to keep him from accepting a self-contradictory idea there? Such a posture renders discussion meaningless and useless.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Instead of continuing to play your usual Jesuitical word games, why not gove us an example of a universal moral truth. The guidelines for universality ate that the " truth " you proclaim to be " universal " have to have been accepted as true by all people at all times and in all locations. Remember that a single disproof causes your system to collapse like the house of cards it is. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I've done this several times before, chester. And these are not word games. The one playing word games is the person who insists that the position based solely upon a logical contradiction is the rational position. That, of course, is not what " universally true " means. In fact, the definition of a " universal truth " is something that is true independent of what people happen to believe about it. It is something that would be true even if every person were sure that it was false. It seems you are the one prone to word games. That is not surprising because you certainly don't want to have to confront the fact that your entire ethical worldview is based upon a logical contradiction, and compels the conclusion that nothing -- absolutely nothing -- can be immoral. Do you really think that just because one person might disagree with a proposition, therefore the proposition is false? In that case, I disagree with everything you ever have said. It must be, then, that everything you ever have said has been false, no?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Still tap dancing, we see. If you have stated things previously, why not own up to them and either restate them here and now or provide a link to your writing? One person SAYING some this is false does not make it so ; one person DEMONSTRATING that a purported " universal truth " is untrue makes it false. As others have put it so well, morality is a social construct, nothing more, nothing less. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It is not my responsibility to do the legwork for you. But I did anyway. The conversation between myself and you that began here : http://www.4forums.com/political/abo...tml#post307133. This was back when you were travelling these parts under the name " bhbcu 64. " I'm sure you remember that. And how, exactly, do you purport to demonstrate that the statement " murder is objectively wrong " is false?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I don't have to. You did a remarkably good job of it when you said that it was moral for a mother to smother her infant to death if its cries would alert guards that the mother, the child, and others were in the process of escaping from a concentration camp. Your objectve morality there seems to be a Benthamite utilitarian statement about the greatest good for the great 4 est number. Now, let's see you play your usual Jesuitical word games and try to describe the mother's act as " not murder. " <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I'm afraid I don't recall ever saying that. Surely if I said it, you could produce some evidence, right? Except that I reject utilitarianism. You seem to enjoy putting words in people's mouths.

How? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>There's a difference between duration and intensity.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Yeah,... and the context of my comment that it seems you want to see the convicted " suffer more " was not based on intensity,... it was based upon duration. Remember, you said you would rather not " see them hang " as " hanging is to good for them. " YOU chose to use the words " too good " as though dying quickly rather than slowly is " too good for them. " Your preference is that they not have it that quick and easy. Right? That's what you said. When you say " Hanging is too good for them. " The not so subtle implication is clear.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>no, it doesn't say rights for a reason. Equal protection under the law means you can't say one group is allowed to be murdered while the others have the protection of the " do not muder " law. I guess if laws are rights to you then you can say that. The Supreme Court doesn't get many income tax law cases. Once again, save it for another forum. You have no idea how many cases I have read ;) nonono, if our standard is going to be the dictionary then a human is a person and a fetus is a human. I will agree with all of the above then. If the fetus is a person then Roe vs Wade get overturned ( as stated in the case ) and thus the state laws on the books will go back to what they were and the killing the fetus would be the " unlawful killing of a person ". So yeah, I'll admit to being wrong via the dictionary assuming thats our standard. http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=person A living human http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=human A member of the genus Homo and especially of the species H. sapiens.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Steeeeve, Brilliant, so you agree that we all have an equal right to life, otherwise what is the basis for laws against murder. If I did not have the right to live, then murdering me could not be against the law and laws passed against murdering me would be unconstitutional because murder would not be a violation of my rights. Why don    t you check the Supreme Court docket for 2005. You may find more than one case regarding taxes was heard and decided. Check your facts before you make a statement. Unsubstantiated statements undermine everything else you say. Based on your statement that the Supreme Court doesn    t get many cases on tax law, I have a good idea how many cases you have read. Is it 2 or 3? So, simply put, a pregnant woman who iingests anything ( alcohol, drugs, poison, etc. ), thereby causing harm ( brain damage say ) to the human fetus she is carrying is guilty or harming a person. Do you agree with that? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No its, true. I wouldn't say it otherwise. We don't need to agree about this here, however, most tax cases are heard in ' tax court ' and rarely get up to the Supreme court level. The mainly only hear cases are of " serious issue " or that conflict between circuit courts. ( source : Concepts in Federal Taxation 2006 Edition ; Murphy & Higgins ) Why are you so quick to ask another question? Are you saying what I said was correct? I want to know if our standard is dictionary definitions.. answer that then I will answer yours.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Try Grable & Sons Metal Products v. Darue Engineering, or Bllard v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service, or Comm    r v. Banks They were all this year. I am basing my question on your previous post : So the question still stands : Do you agree that a pregnant woman who ingests anything ( alcohol, drugs, poison, etc. ), thereby causing harm ( brain damage say ) to the human fetus she is carrying is guilty of harming a person? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Ok? I didn't say there were none. I said not many. Considering thats only three out of the many tax cases heard by the US Tax Code court I would say the Supreme Court doesn't hear that many. I don't think the Ballard case was about Income Tax either. Why won't you answer my question? I want to know if we are on the same level with regards to dictionary definitions before I will answer yours... so whats it gonna be?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>That was 3 cases out of eighty. There were only three other subjects that took a greater percentage of the court's docket. Maybe I am unclear. I thought I posted the thread where we agreed on terms and dictionary definitions. What words do you think we are still unclear on? Please include your definitions and I will let you know if I take issue with any of them <br><b>S1:4-  </b>3 outta 80 with one not even being about the income tax ( which was the orginal point ). We had 2 on the 10 commandments alone and thats not even a ' big ' thing. However, I see it has the Supreme court took 3 outta the insane amount of tax cases heard in tax court. ANd looking at it that way will show that the Supreme Court barely touches the issue. They only tend to look at it for the reasons I stated a few posts up. The dictionary definitions I was referring to would be the ones about person and human... just basic definitions and I thought that if we accept your definition then we have to accept mine as they are from the same source.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Looks like you could use a suppository old boy!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>oops, ouch... Such is life when dealing with the likes of jazyjason. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Hah. If you knew anything about anal sex you'd probably retract your statement. I'm an expert in the subject seeing as I am a catcher after all<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This is one of those times when an image conveys my response better than words ever could. http://www.pukeplanet.com/pukeimages/toilet_puke.jpg <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Hehehe Epic Win....<br><b> S2:3-  </b>That you find the subject humorous at all is the saddest part of this sick exchange. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Awww no I just like seeing you squirm Archie. And the fact that I even mention anything that has to do with gay sex makes you puke makes me laugh. Oh my how the tables have turned. It's one thing for a bigot to scream about gay sex every time a gay issue is brought up but once a gay person actually brings it up all the cockroaches scatter...<br><b>S1:1-  </b>way to get off topic... we are talking about someones view that abortion is personally wrong to them but supports the pro-choice thing. But I see that the " right to do what one wants with his / her body " is over the right to life. I will be sure to use this often.... I want to stab my teacher in the eye using my own body... that trumps his right to life.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Off topic? You asked a question and I answered you. Slaves are not even close to being in the same circumstances that a fetus is to a woman. If slaves were in that situation, then I would completely be against the gov    t giving them the rights you are suggesting the fetus have. The desire is not to    do what one wants with his / her body   . Do you practice being obtuse? The desire is to prevent others from using ( or allowing the use of ) ones body against his / her will. In your    analogy    ( and I use the term loosely ), the desired right is more closely aligned with the teacher. Whatever you want to do, the teacher does not want his body    used    in that manner. It does not match exactly, but your example has almost nothing in common with a pregnancy relationship. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yeah, I asked a rhetorical question... The point was to show the inconsistent belief that if a person believes life begins at conception yet they believe in pro-choice then they are in fact inconsistent. Al Sharpton comes to mind as a person like this.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You tried to draw a comparison between two vastly different circumstances that are not directly comparable. It is a false analogy and no point can come out of that. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>What? This is the third or fourth time I have said this. I was makign the point about this. If you believe that life begins at conception then if you also believe in the right to choose you are inconsistent. I then compared this to slavery in a way by saying... I am personally against abortion but I support a womens right to choose whether or not she wants the baby. and I am personally against slavery but I support a slaveholders right to choose whether or not he / she wants a slave. The comparison in view points remains valid. The same reasoning goes in for both of them... That is, you believe in your own views but not forcing them on others.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Inconsistent in what way? I do not see it as inconsistent. This is not an inconsistent statement. Believing others should have the right to do something you may personally disagree with is not an inconsistent position. It would only be inconsistent if you personally disagreed with something and did it yourself. No, comparing someone's view on abortion with their view on slavery is shameless play at comparing abortion and slavery. The point is just as easily made if taken by itself. If you wish. However, neither are inconsistent postions.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Sure, adherence to " God's law " serves but one purpose, it is an insurance policy for one's soul ( assuming one has one ) against those laws being for real. Adherence to human laws actually have a purpose within the real world ( or " this life " if you prefer ) in that they enable society to function. So which to superceed the other : insurance policy or a means to a functional society? The choice is obviously the latter<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What if humans created a law that said all jews dont deserve to live and handicap people dont deserve to live as well.. Even war vetrans with a missing arm should be executed.. what i'm getting from your statement is, Hitler's manmade laws were ok and were greater than God's law. Now that i have pointed out that a natural law exists and you know that it exists ( because you hopefully believe as i do that hitler was a terrible person ) let me ask you a question.. who created this natural law? it certainly isnt manmade! <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Nope, you have invented something there missing from my statement : Hilter's laws were far from OK. They were inherently greater than any " god's law " that may or may not exist though - you had that bit right. What? I most certainly do not " know " that any " natural law " exists, quite the opposite. It doesn't exist therefore who or what created it is irrelevent.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You obviously do know that some law is a standard in coming to the conclusion that hitler was wrong in his actions.. Who created that conviction within you?? and who created the fact that the things he was doing were wrong?? SOMEONE HAD TO and it wasnt any man.. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Very true, it was a woman : my mother. She taught me the basic " right from wrong " that forms the moral base, and thus the laws, of my society. It is because Hilter's actions were so out of kilter with the morals of my society that they are judged to be so wrong by that society and thus by me. There is no " some law is a standard in coming to the conclusion that hitler was wrong in his actions " or to put it in English : Hilter's actions were not intrinsicly wrong, they are just judged to be wrong by the standards of most of the modern world.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Your logic here really scares me. If his actions werent intrinisicly wrong, i guess there is no absolute that we are morally right to judge him. Thats according to you.. And by the way, where did your mother get those convictions from?? and beyond.. there is something in every human heart that knows murder is wrong, stealing is wrong, and so forth. Who created that is what i wanna know.. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>That is correct. We are free to judge him, but there is no absolute against which we can judge him. The only thing in my heart is blood. I use my head for such matters and I know that not every human head holds that murder is wrong, stealing is wrong and that not every human head agrees on what murder and theft are. You should try using your head, rather than a blood pump, for thinking one day and you too could ditch this silly notion of absolute morality governing the human race.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>So if there is no absolute morality, i can go kill someone and claim " OH even though the government says its wrong, i can still do it because there is no moral certainty that its not wrong! " ill just leave it at that. by the way, the human brain isnt the greatest thing to live by in the world. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Yes you can. Then you will be read your rights and arrested, tried and locked up. In no way does " no absolute morality " equate with " I can do whatever I like ".<br><b>S1:1-  </b>What happens if British society tomorrow deemed it Ok to ship people from Africa to the Americas to be sold as slaves? A changing basis of morality is a two way street : it could progress positively, and it could progress negatively. Why should I accept a system that has the potential to deem slavery as a moral institution?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Correct. I'm sorry, I do not understand the question. There is nothing for you to accept. I am merely explaining simple reality for a few confused people. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes, you say the basis for morality is society. I disagree and do not accept such a whimsical basis that has no principle nor produces any reason to value anything.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If you wish to adopt such a " Flat Earther " approach to the matter, that is your choice. It's hardly the first time that I've come across a religious person refusing to accept reality and it will not be that last. Have a nice life now. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I fail to see how your approach is an adoption of reality. Your basis does not produce a logical reason why I should value anything. It is a worldview that adopts an absolute moral standard that produces the highest value on human life. I'm afraid that one consequence of a subjective moral system is that it is indeed not possible to say that what Hitler did was intrinsically wrong. Why should I adopt such a worldview that will not allow me to logically say that what Hitler did was intrinsically wrong?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Oh well. Keep trying and you will get there one day. Assuming of course that " absolute moral standard " places a high value on human life. No existing claimed " absolute moral standard " achieves this even remotely. This is correct. And round and round we go. You are not required to " adopt " anything. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The absolute standard I have referred to over and over is one in which the highest value is placed on human life. Therefore I can say with certainty and quite logically that what Hitler did was intrinsically wrong.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>That is indeed a laudible moral standard to aspire to. You delude yourself in thinking that it is absolute though. You can ( quite correctly IMO ) say that what Hitler did was wrong, but you are incorrect when you claim it was intrinsically wrong. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Not according to an absolute moral standard that places the highest value on human life. The only reason I keep replying is because I want people to understand just where the relativist postion leads. Under moral relativism, we can't say that child molestation, genocide, racism, slavery, or anything is intrisically wrong ( you have said as much ). Therefore, under moral relativism there really is no reason to make laws against such things. Yet even further, there really is no reason to follow such laws should they exist. Moral relativism, if followed out to its logical conclusion, leads to anarchy and disorder where no action is justly punishable and justice has no meaning. Also, what does IMO mean? I've seen it a few times, but I must confess that I am illiterate when it comes to forum abbreviations.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>It's unfortunate that you are unable to stick to the truth therefore if you are so driven and instead must stoop to misrepresentation. Are you a creationist by any chance? This is quite blatantly untrue. To make a society work, humans need rules : we need a system of morality and we need laws. Without them, society falls apart. No your strawman leads to anarchy and disorder. It has nothing to do with morality being relative. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Misrepresentation? What reason does a moral relativist have to establish laws, follow those laws, and punish violators of those laws? I obviously agree that we need a system of morality. Where is that morality derived from? We need a basis for establishing what is right and what is wrong. What reason does a moral relativist have to establish laws, follow those laws, and punish violators of those laws?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>The term " moral relativist " is a tautology. Just " moralist " will do fine. Society needs morals to function as it must be able to judge right from wrong to function as a society. That basis will vary depending upon the circumstances ( and prior beliefs / tranditions ) of that society. It's a society that has the need to " establish laws, follow those laws, and punish violators of those laws " etc. A moralist merely philosophises about morals. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>What if I don't want to subscribe to my culture's morality, but instead want to subscribe to another culture's morals? A society has to adopt some moral standard to establish laws and punish lawbreakers. We keep coming back to the same thing : where does this standard derive from?<br><b> S2:7-  </b>Then you, broadly speaking, have the following choices : Rebel and risk punishment Seek to change your culture's morality to better fit the other's. Move to that other society The needs and traditions of that society. Different societies have different needs and traditions ; different societies have different moral standards<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Not according to an absolute moral standard that places the highest value on human life. The only reason I keep replying is because I want people to understand just where the relativist postion leads. Under moral relativism, we can't say that child molestation, genocie, racism, slavery, or anything is intrisically wrong ( you have said as much ). Therefore, under moral relativism there really is no reason to make laws against such things. Yet even further, there really is no reason to follow such laws should they exist. Moral relativism, if followed out to its logical conclusion, leads to anarchy and disorder where no action is justly punishable and justice has no meaning. Also, what does IMO mean? I've seen it a few times, but I must confess that I am illiterate when it comes to forum abbreviations.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>How can there be one moral standard which applies to all people given we know of societies that have moral standards different than our own? Example : In the past it was customary in some Polynesian cultures for women to bear children prior to taking a husband to demonstrate to all prospective husbands that they could indeed bear children. No negative social stigma. There are many such examples. IMO = In My Opinion. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Just because there exists a diversity of opinion surrounding morality, it in no way follows that an absolute moral standard does not exist.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So according to you someone acting morally within their culture could be in fact immoral according to your idea of " absolute " morality. Then what? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The possibility certainly arises. Hitler comes to mind. Then we have a standard by which we can deem actions right or wrong, we can have a basis for making laws, we can have a basis for actually following laws, and we can have a basis for punishing lawbreakers.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>How does this apply to a person in that other culture? Should all acts deemed immoral also be illegal? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>That other culture is accountable to the same absolute moral standard, and as such so are the people within that culture. Sure why not. But there are obviously degrees of immorality and thus there should be degrees of illegality.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Where are these " degrees " of absolute moral standards set forth? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Look to the Creator of the moral universe, that Supreme Judge of all the world.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Would you be referring to written word or direct communication? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>How about a written record of a direct communication?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>So then can I assume that you feel all " law " for all people should be in conformance with the " morality " set forth this written word? I will not take issue with the authenticity of the writings themselves for now. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>Yes. Apparently I need more words to post my answer....<br><b> S2:7-  </b>Would rejection of the authority of this written word be an act of immorality itself and therefore an illegal act the society you envision?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Isn't a dead person also still human?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I'll be able to answer that if you can clarify the diffrence between a human and a person. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Dead mind. As long as a fetus is human without a mind wouldn't a dead person without a mind also be human?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>To equate a fetus with the unability to think to a dead body is, well, wrong. A dead person, that is void of soul-spirit would be a dead body. The fetus will, under natural conditions will have the ability to think. A dead body cannot think. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I didn't realize that you could determine whether a soul-spirit would be in a dead, living, or unborn body. How can you tell if it is in there or not? At what point do you consider it a fetus? The moment the sperm enters the egg? A week after? A month after? In the early stages the fetus will not have the ability to think just as a dead body doesn't. In the late stages it will have the ability and I think this is what you are debating here.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>For your first question, please bear with me... very new at debating and clarifying myself. You asked a good question and you desrve a good answer. I'll need to chew on that and get back to you. For your second question, and I'm not familiar in sciences or biology, the fetus is a later stage of devolopment, from sperm + egg, then zygote, then fetus. Stages of devepment Now, you said " in the later stages it will have the ability to think... " How did you come to that conclusion? Why the later stages of development ( fetus )? Would it not be that a zygote STILL has the chances of the ability to think as it develops into a fetus, then a infant? Peace<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I don't think anyone is doubting that humans are by nature selfish. It is just somewhere you gotta draw the line. Direct killing of someone is probably a good place to start. Eventhough we are all selfish, it is a good idea to try and limit it to a reasonable level.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So why don't we do the same thing with ants and other insects? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>why don't you answer your own question. Why don't you kill a human the same way you would kill an ant? ( as in without a second thought )<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well I don't kill ants without a second thought. If there is one in the house, I toss it outside alive, but many people do just crush them without a second thought. Another answer is that I would be punished severely by the government if I murdered a human. ( again the only reason a human having a right to life being a government threat ) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>so, you would ok if murder laws were taken away and people could freely kill each other? You would not feel violated in any way? Moreover, slaves had no rights because the government didn't recoginse them?... So why did we all of a sudden feel they had a right to rights when they had no rights at all?? Very confusing.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>no. Wrong. Right. we decided to give them rights. Not really. I'll expound a little. I would not be ok if murder laws were taken away because I feel that the right to life is important. I would feel violated but actually probably not, I would just feel dead. You are correct, slaves had no rights which is why they were treated so poorly with no consequences, they were fighting for civil RIGHTS. They didn't have the rights and were fighting for them. They wanted the same rights as everyone else, fought for them, and won them. Now the government will arrest you if you murder a black or white, or if you enslave someone.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>So you would save the mouse over the baby for religious reasons? And there is also a chance that the cute little puppy you save will turn into a mean, viscous, and undomesticated animal that comes back to bite the hand that saved it ( that being you ). Ok, then ; we need to decrease the surplus population. Can we begin by eliminating you? Even so, your dog isn't worth the collar it wears when compared to the intrinsic priceless worth of another human being. Are you opposed to war? But what about Are you opposed to the death penalty? But what about this...<br><b> S2:1-  </b>How is that any different then saving two of each species over a single human? Even if that does happen, it can be reversed. Good luck doing that with a human. Poor argument. gnojek is adding to total GDP production. Is a newborn doing that? LOL. I don't know what is more amusing, the fact that you couldn't prove that if your life depended on it, or that you actually said it. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not sure why you felt the urge to comment here. Do you think that gnojek's reason for saving the mouse over the baby is correct? You are obviously thinking of some minor little bite on the hand. I'm thinking of the kind of bite that rips someone's hand off, causes them to get gangrene, which ultimately causes them to die ; something that cannot be reversed. A Human, on the other hand, would be less likely to engage in biting the hand that saved it because of the various consequences that would result ( law, jail, restitution, etc. ) So what?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, that's just his opinion. You obviously would do the opposite. As such because there is no standard of action, the value of life, ranging across species is by no way equal. That is not up for debate. I made the comment in regards to your's. Besides, it was too fitting. LOL. Sure, if the person is in the middle of nowhere with no means of communication. ;) You are getting funnier by the moment. Yet we have 2 million people in jail in the US alone with at least 10 + million in China. Reasses your argument. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Tell me Duo, is it always the case that in order to decrease the surplus population, we should look at who contributes to the total GDP production, find those people who don't contribute, and eliminate them?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Tell me Cone, why is it that as arguments go on and on, you have a tendency to ignore the majority of posts and try to use the fallacy of selective reading to fool people into thinking you are correct? Since when was it always the case? Oh wait, that isn't true, you are merely trying to put words into my mouth. Very childish to say the very least. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Duo, I asked you a question ; I didn't put words in your mouth. Can you / will you just answer the question?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You constantly prove what a waste of time it is attempting to reason with such an irrational person lyte. So I refuse to waste my time trying. now write an extensive rambling tirade in response to this paragraph in order to once again feel like your winning something because you used the most words.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Trying to justify your irrational position? I wouldn't waste my time either. I'd just stop holding fast to the irrational position. You seriously think that I think I win because I happened to use more words? Of course you don't, unless you're even more stupid than I've been led to believe. No, you're just issuing a parting, pathetic potshot in an effort to cover the fact that you couldn't refute a single thing I said. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Stupid is as stupid does sonny boy. And I wont refute your juvenile attacks because they're, well, juvenile attacks and not worth responding to, unless I want to sink to your level of ignorance, and I choose not to. But thanks for the proof of what you bring to the forum. Especially since any reasonable pro-abortionist would welcome a compromise offered by a staunch pro-lifer ; if it was a compromise and not an irrational flame war with said pro-lifer. So you have proven for all to see that it isn't compromise or rational discussion you are here for, but just to attack me no matter how friendly and compromising I try to be. Here's smileys post and my response to him. POST #17 Yesterday, 11:03 PM<br><b> S2:2-  </b>And here are ( 1 ) my ( 2 ) three ( 3 ) responses where I make it clear that you're wrong in your labeling of both my arguments and me. Repeating yourself doesn't change these facts. Refusing to address my points at all does nothing to help you, either. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Thanks for posting these as evidence of your irrational attacks on me for actually offering the compromise in response to smileys post. Your hypocrisy is evident for all to see.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Whatever you say, Archie. Anybody who can read will do so and laugh at your assertions.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You feel like that because that is exactly what the article is trying to do. It is very common for things like that when looking at a pro-life biased article. If you read the actual study ( I gave a link to the canadian one ), you will see no such shifting of the blame, in fact you will see quite the opposite of what the articles posted by " ____ " say.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Post the article. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>So you pretty much admit here that you did not read the actual report of the study? Anyway, I already gave a link back in post #3 of the candaian study ( which came from the first article you linked which was different from the actual cut and paste article you posted ), so apparently we have soid evidence that you don't bother to read the posts of other people. Here it is once again : Violence and abortions : What's a doctor to do? Since you seem to have problems looking at the links provided by other people, here is the full text of the actual article that your first link had a link to :<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, I asked that you post the article. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>What the f-ing hell do you think I just did?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Just because I asked you to post the article it doesn't mean anything other than a request to post the article, you read too much into the request.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>We are built to eat meat, I will always eat meat, and meat is good for us, however abortion is bad for us. How weak is your argument that you resort to comparing abortion to eating meat? That is very poor indeed. Where did I mention religion? Abortion causes great suffering for the mother in terms of guilt and regret, not to mention the damage it causes society.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Do not assume this, as it is not always a given. What damage does it cause society? I'm drawing a blank. Thanks. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I have never assumed this is " always a given ". Don    t you think killing innocent people harms society?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You said it. I just want you to remember that not everyone falls into this category. Don    t you think killing innocent people harms society? [ / QUOTE ] No, I really don't. I would like to see some statistical information about how this is. Enlighten me. If I can see concrete evidence rather than " it effects morale " ( how? ) and " we're not churning out enough little worker bees " ( should women become mandated baby factories to support the population? ) then I'll be happy to change my mind that killing feti harms society. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Incorrect, I have never said it was, " always a given   . But surely it is more important to remember those that do fall into this category. If killing innocent people doesn    t harm society, why is it illegal to kill innocent people?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No, it's not more important. It's very important to help these women, of course, but don't forget about the ones who don't feel regret. Of course, this is no perk to the anti-choice crowd. Impossible that a woman would have an abortion and not feel guilt! She must be some soulless heathen incapable of having any real feelings. We must tell her what she should feel! ( Not directed at you ; just a societal thought ) But would you ban abortion because some women feel guilty? It's apparently, by your own definition, not. Since ( I believe ) you define abortion as killing innocent people, and abortion is legal, it's not. So how is killing innocent unborn persons harmful to society? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So you think it is not more important to remember those that receive great suffering in terms of guilt and regret, as oppose to those that have no regrets? No, I would ban abortion because it is genocide. Correct, so if killing innocent people doesn    t harm society, why is it illegal to kill innocent people? Well, consider what would happen if every pregnancy ended that way?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>There arn't really terms for these things, and the terms we have have thousands of definitions - I'm talking about people in the way you would encounter in everyday life rather than things that are technically people but nothing like someone you would meet on the street. I've no problem really with feti and embryo being referred to along with human ( unless you are implying therefore that the human definition is something special ) but I'll tend to use person to refer to a child / adult human ( rather than adult human as it implies you are leaving babies and children out ).<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You can encounter the unborn in everyday life too, through ultra sound, 3D scans, listening to their heartbeat through a stethoscope, etc, etc.. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Thats not everyday life, thats looking at feti. For the sake of the argument - we are talking about concious and developed humans. I find it a lot easier to say people and just assume you know what I am trying to say, the fact that we are nitpicking each other's points here shows the whole problem with the nomenclature. Can we agree to this system for the time being, just to argue the points at least? Human = Anything that is, or will develop into a Human Being / Homo Sapian Person = Someone who has been born, regardless of age Fetus = Anything that is, or will develop into a Human Being / Homo Sapian but has not yet been born ( not strictly accurate, but it can do for now )<br><b> S2:2-  </b>How about we just accept facts as they are? A human is a human. A person is someone born if you accept conception as the birth of a person. Foetus is an unborn human / Person. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>By definition, clearly. I don't though, but hey lets go with this for now. So then, to the original point, you apparently condemn killing, however.... Yet would you also condem the killing of a serial killer? Or of a soldier on peace keeping duties trying to defend civilians from an attack by opposed militia? Do you really think its the same as genocide, or are embryos and fetus important enough not to be allowed to be aborted but not as important as a born person, possibly with dependents of their own?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I condemn all killings. Abortion is genocide ; it is the systematic destruction of the unwanted.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Yup, she is. Because a feetus is not legaly a person. Morally, I don`t view infants as persons either, but as you have to draw the line somehwere, you might as well do it at birth ( or at some time during pregnancy, I don`t really care as long as the choice of aborting a unwanted pregnancy is till viable for most people ).<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You don't view infants as people either? What form of beast are you? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Last time I checked, I was fairly human :p<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I'm glad that you qualified your answer with " fairly ". It certainly isn't normal to consider an infant NOT a person. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>What or who defines " normal "? Don`t get me wrong though, I like infants. They are quite amazing to see. I just don`t see them as persons.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're scaring me again, Eddie. :)<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Agreed, I ask the people that support that arguement where this right comes from. I am not sure if I have gotten a real answer yet.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The Supreme Court ruling is brought up to as a legal argument, not as a justification. Yes, part of the debate is whether abortions are " right ". The argument is not for the " right to do whatever she wants with her own body ", but that none have the right to do whatever they wish to hers. No, it is that you do not understand pro-choice arguments. Steve, That is because your question is nonsense. The gov't does not have the power to prevent you from having one. It is often spoken of as a " right to abortion " because we have the right to do things even if the gov't does not wish us to. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yeah, but you don't have the right to kill someone, you don't have the right to steal, you don't have the right to do cocaine. The government makes a lot of things illegal. I agree, the constitution puts limits on the government... however, they said nothing about abortion. So where did the right come from... since I guess we are assuming it from the government<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Agreed, the Constitution says nothing about abortion. However, the Constitution does say that any powers not given to the gov't the Federal Gov't does not have. The Federal Gov't does not have the power to regulate pregnancy. It came from the Constitution. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So it would then go to the States I don't recall anything in the consitution that says that. Where does the constitution say you have the " right to abortion " or whatever you wish to call it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Agreed, and it is a State issue. I simply feel compelled to point out a national ban is unconstitutional.... I'm trying to decide if you're this dense on purpose. I didn't say we had a right to abortion, I said the Constitution doesn't allow the Federal Gov't to restrict it. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>But then a national ban on banning would be unconstitutional too. Thus Roe vs Wade would be wrong. My mistake... I got that you meant that from the following.... See where I got that idea now? So I am still wondering where the right comes from then. I don't think you are suggesting that you have a right to everything unless it is restricted are you?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>That's an interesting argument. What is your support for this? If a state made a law banning guns, was challenged and the case went to the Supreme Court and the Court struck down that law it would in effect place a ban on banning guns. This is a perfectly valid use of their power, and is not legislating by any stretch of the imagination. Keep in mind you cannot use the support of an unproven point ( " substantive due process is wrong! " ) to support this argument. In a sense you do. If there is no law forbidding an action and you do that action, who is to say it was illegal? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>This gets into the " where do rights come from " arguement... and I honestly don't wanna do that again. I will leave that to Cone or Chloe or something. lol, substantive due process is no where in the constitution, however, I don't believe I was thinking along those lines. See a " ban on guns " is a something clearly stated in the constitution ( as in your right to have a gun ). However, the 2nd amendment says nothing about Congress not being able to restrict what guns you can have. ANyway, if something is not address in the constitution it is said to go the states.. this is the case with abortion. So to rule on it one way or the other is unconstitutional. I think you can't put a ban on abortion ( as in court case ) because it says nothing in the constitution about being allowed to do that... same goes with a ban on banning. Hopefully that clear up my point :p<br><b>S1:1-  </b>well i was downplaying your argument because really, pregnancy is not that demeaning to a womans body. ITS NATURAL! OBESITY ISNT! very smart answer. I never knew men couldnt get pregnant. lol, you just made yourself look like an idiot with that statement. by the way, i was referring to those issues are pretty much symptoms of obesity. But the thing is... obesity isnt natural, the process of pregnancy is totally natural. i guess to you though, one of those people being impacted doesnt count because its just a " blob of tissue ". well, whatever the case may be, that baby has a full function nervous system and can feel the pain whenever it is aborted. Does that not disturb you? People always tend to think " oh the mother is going to go through pain " BLA BLA BLA.. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BABY THAT IS BEING TORTURED TO DEATH? cmon. wonderful. Go read our decleration of independence. Maybe then you'll see that everyone should be guarenteed life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. maybe then you'll see every child aborted doesnt just lose its life, but also loses its destiny!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You don't know what you're talking about. Provide proof of your claim. Let's say for a 12 week fetus since most abortions are performed prior to this. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Go Read a psychology book and you'll find it there. It starts around the 1st week after conception.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Now you're just winging it. Your claim, your burden. Psychology books discussing fetal nervous systems, that's rich. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>im not wingin it my friend. If you reall want me to i will type it out from my psychology book.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Please do and be sure to include the book and author. I somehow doubt we will be friends. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>sad to hear that you approach every relationship on the basis that you think you are higher than everyone else. I'll still be your friend if youd like.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Not everyone and no thanks.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Nope, it's divine judgment for continuing wickedness. Have you ever read the Bible, pappi? Genesis 15 : - 12 As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him. 13 Then the Lord said to him,    Know for certain that for four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own ( Egypt ) and that they will be enslaved and mistreated there. 14 But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions. 15 You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age. 16 In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites ( and Canaanites, etc. ) has not yet reached its full measure.    The Warning Destruction of the Canaanites http://www.apologeticspress.org/apco...1&article=1224<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Nope. Divine Judgement is you are guilty. The punishment was genocide Have you read what I posted? Please explain what point you are hoping to make with this response. Yes I have read the Bible. Based on results I would venture more than you have. Do you think you could answer the question I asked that is actually related to the OP? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That's stupid. When divine Judgment falls the verdict from God is already guilty.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You are guilty so what. The woman who committed adultery was guilty, the punishment could have been death, but it was not. Divine Judgement is separate from the penalty, in the case of an individual that person is killed, when God murders or causes to be enslaved the innocent with the guilty Christians somehow turn this into being just, I guess just casualties of war, wrong place wrong time. To eradicate an entire people is genocide, whether they deserved it or God justified it doesn't change what it is. The reality is there were a few hundred thousand militant Hebrews who needed a place to live and couldn't take on Egypt to the south, couldn't survive in the desert to the East, no boats to cross the ocean to the west and had a fertile region populated by a group of city states independent of each other in decline. So they decided to conquer and what better way to do this than by declaring God commanded it. He had said he would give them the land, not he would make them fight for it. Now do you think you would like to try answering the questions asked that relate to this thread? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You're still deluded. The children of the baby killers grow up into baby killers themselves. Just like the anti-Israel Muslims, who raise up their children to hate and kill Jews. Here's another flash for you. God    s Judgment Saves Lives How many people would 100 evil men kill in their lifetimes? Let's say a thousand, and the 100 evil men wind up in hell when they die. Now, let's let those 100 evil men have 100 offspring that over time grow up to kill the original 1,000 other people, plus 1,000 more. Now, you have 200 evil men in hell and 2,000 murdered others. Let's take it to the 10th or so generation. Now you've had 10,000 evil men giving birth to 10,000 offspring and together those 20,000 evil men and or women offspring kill 200,000 people total. So, you now have 20,000 evil men and women in hell ( vs. 100 if you had nailed them earlier ), plus 200,000 other dead people. So God, being smarter than his critics, and able to see consequences further out in time than the stiff-necked " God is evil " crowd, saves 19,900 people from going to hell plus he saves 199,000 others from getting murdered. ( please excuse any math errors ). Get the picture? God SAVES!!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Your picture needs to be adjusted. You are so intent on being right you fail to really understand what you say. Let's say you have 10 cities and each has 1,000 people. Of those each city has 100 evil people, but that leaves 900 people who are good or neutral, not good, but not evil. You want to solve the problem of the evil people by killing everybody, which includes the 100 innocent people in each city ( total 900 ). So how much good did you wipe off the planet with the death of the good people and how much evil did you create with the indiscriminate slaughter of the remaining population? Now the truth of the matter is the Israelites needed some place to go and live. So they went back to the place of their ancestors. When they discovered that the wilderness of Sin wasn't as nice as that of their Semitic neighbors they decided since Abraham had moved there and they all came from him they would say they came from there also. The best motivator for a people of the time was religion, so God was used to justify their conquest and genocide. If killing the evil people is what God believes the smartest way to go, why does he prohibit it now? Now you want to get back to the point of the thread?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The right to have a choice IS a legal issue. We don't live in russia Women in this country have the same rights as men. How special, now all you have to do is prove that a glob of cells has rights ;)<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Ingus, please see my comments at the end of my previous post. The purpose of this thread is to introduce ourselves and have a Q & A about the basis for each others views etc. If you want to debate the specific differences we may have in our views, either open a new thread and invite me over, challenge me, whatever... But I'm not going to debate it here. I think this thread is a great idea. People should introduce themselves, lay out their views however they see fit and let others do the same. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Oh, you want it in a Q and A form? My bad. Please allow me to rephrase what I said earlier... Q - Where is your documentation that a glob of cells has any rights? OK, now we'll be looking forward to your ' answer ' BTW, all threads in this section are up for debate. When you avoid responding to what others have addressed in this thread, it just proves that your so-called argument is weak. But you can't debate this here because you have no facts to back up your rhetoric, and you have no facts because anti-choicers " think " emotionally, and not logically. Have a nice day :)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If you guys want to discuss any of this any further with me, either start a new thread or direct me to one already started. ( Better yet, issue one of those challenge threads they look interesting ) This thread is supposed to be just for posters to introduce themselves and state their beliefs. If we are to badger one another over the details and specifics in this thread, it will only discourage others from joining in. I for one would like to see as many people as possible post their position and a little bit about themselves. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Help yourself. Click here and pick one<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Tell you what. Since you don't want to issue a challenge or start a new thread, I'll start one ( a new challenge ) when I get more time. I'm working on some other things right now and I don't have much time to compose anything. I don't know about you but it takes me a lot less time for me to write a response than it does a basis and challenge for a new debate. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Don't waste your time. I seriously doubt you'll say anything new that I haven't heard before in the last 20 years that I've been debating anti-choicers You're not here to learn, you're here to feel good about your delusions. I'm far too busy to waste my time entertaining a revolving door<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I wasn't quite ready to conclude that an exchange with you would be a waste of time,... but I'll take you at your word and thank you for saving me from the waste.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>This where you become annoying. I never said the mother should have no choice at all, I said if the fetus feels stress during a termination then it should be considered a sentient human being. This means that there are two sentient human beings to consider not one. Why are you not capable of reading a simple post? I am not ' content a judgement for every woman out there '. I have given my opinion. You seem a little hormonal today... or am I making a false assumption like you did?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Do you have an opinion on the fact she was denied access to abortion? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes I think that it is an incredibly sad situation. I think that abortion is perfectly acceptable until the fetus is developed enough to suffer during termination then at least some consideration should be shown to that suffering. A few days ago a woman a few miles away from me gave birth to a 22 week old fetus and begged the hospital to try to help the baby. They just told her that they cannot even try to help a baby that was born before 24 weeks. The baby died in the mothers arms. If this baby was developed enough to live a few minutes in its mothers arms then there is a chance it would be developed enough to feel pain and / or distress. I suppose the most convenient thing to do is just rip the fetus apart and put it in the incinerator. Who cares if the fetus suffers for a few minutes? Hell, we are talking about womens rights here. The congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says it knows of no legitimate evidence showing a fetus can ever experience pain but as I stated before, the very same body of proffessionals had no evidence that new borns felt pain either. Apparently they do.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>At some point you have to believe someone unless you plan to doubt everything that group has to say about anything. Since the mechanism to be conscious of pain, by the evidence, doesn't form until the third trimester, would you think it's reasonable to say that this woman shouldn't be barred from abortion until then? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If the mechanism to be conscious of pain / distress does not form until the third trimester then it would be unreasonable to say that the woman should not terminate the child. Can a Fetus Feel Pain? U.K. Report Says No. - Newsweek Some say they do, some say they dont..... Do you believe that mother should be able to terminate the child after the third trimester?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I believe abortion should be allowed until premature birth is easier on the woman. I don't know when that point is, but I assume it exists. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Even if the fetus suffers pain / distress?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Yes. I think the woman is of paramount importance in the pregnancy relationship. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Fair enough. You believe that we should not give the potential suffering of the fetus any consideration and I think we should. All clear now.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Not quite, but close enough I suppose. I think the suffering of the fetus deserves consideration, but that consideration to the woman should and does outweigh it. If the fetus deserved no consideration, then I would accept abortion until birth. You seem to believe the opposite, that the suffering of the fetus outweighs the suffering of the woman. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I have said all along that the suffering of the fetus should be considered whereas you have only stated this in your last post. Glad you have seen sense at<br><b> S2:6-  </b>lol, you didn't ask until that last post whether the fetus deserves consideration, so why would I state it before then? <br><b>S1:7-  </b>Because it was an fundamental part of the debate. I stressed the fetus needs consideration from the beginning wheras you did not mention it until pressed. You seemed not care at all about the suffering of the fetus in the above posts. Then you back pedalled.....<br><b> S2:7-  </b>I was asking your opinion on it :-\ When you asked me my opinion on it I gave it, saying the woman was the most important participant. Then you mentioned the fetus specifically I clarified, saying that it deserves consideration, but reiterated that the woman was the most important participant. You're creating dark corners where they don't exist :P <br><b>S1:8-  </b>There are no dark corners, just you trying to cover your tracks lol. You stated that abortion should be allowed until premature birth is easier on the WOMAN. Even if the fetus suffers suffers pain / stress because the woman is paramount in the pregnancy relationship. Then when I pointed out you do not believe that the suffering of the fetus should have any consideration... which you clearly expressed... you back pedalled.... Dont get me wrong. I am glad that you see sense ;)<br><b> S2:8-  </b>I don't think you and I have the same definition of backpeddling. I never said the fetus should get no consideration, so accusing me of having that position at any point is dishonest. The fact that the woman's needs should be more important does not even imply that the fetus is unimportant. <br><b>S1:9-  </b>You mentioned that the woman needs should be paramount without mentioning how much consideration the fetus should have. You answer to my question of should the fetus be aborted even if it suffered was.. yes. I will will change ' backpedalling ' to ' weasel words '.. hows that?<br><b> S2:9-  </b>That's correct, I didn't tell you until you asked what consideration was owed the fetus :P So your accusation about my belief is incorrect, and continuing that charge is dishonest. Weasel words has an actual definition. In what way was anything I said part of that definition? <br><b>S1:10-  </b>When I asked if the fetus should be aborted even if it felt pain / distress you said YES. Your weasel words are the ambiguous and quibbling use of them by you then and after. Should I change it to dishonest? Your belief was that the fetus should be terminated even if it suffered, if the mother required it. Dont lie and say you<br><b> S2:10-  </b>That's correct, because concerns of the woman are more important than the consideration I would give the fetus. That isn't the same thing as saying " the fetus deserves no consideration " which is what you dishonestly assigned to me. What was ambiguous about anything I said? <br><b>S1:11-  </b>Aborting the fetus even if it suffers is giving no consideration to it.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The simple fact is that people don't want the immense responsibility that logically pertains to their voluntary actions actions, so they fabricate denials of reality as a convenient escape, out of pure selfishness -- like every other atrocity in history. The study of law includes an analysis of how people excuse their wrongdoings, fabricating pausible rationalizations for their acting to benefit at another's expense ; denial is typically the first of these, claiming that the act " does not hurt anyone, " however obvious the contrary. Other rationales follow, such as self-preservation, natural right to act, and eventually growing defensive by blaming the victim. While the fabricator typically believes his story original, it is anything but -- it's simply the inevitable course of selfishness.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>OMG. Here we go again. Please tell us on what basis the state is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is. What theory of law would you use to support your point? Hypothetical situation : Roe is overturned, returning control over abortion to the states. State " A " bans abortions ; state " B " permits them under most circumstances. 1. What sanction does State " A " put in place to punish those who have abortions within its borders? Upon whom is the sanction applied? The woman? The doctor? 2. How does state " A " prevent its citizens from traveling to state " B " to have the abortion performed? 3. How will state " A " determine that one of its citizens has traveled to state " B " to have the abortion performed? 4. Can state " A " punish one of its citizens for traveling to state " B " to have a legal act performed on her? 5. By what claim of right is any man entitled to an opinion on the question? After you finish those, Joel, I have a few more for you. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes, it seems you never learn, so I have no hope of educating you, and absolutely no intention. Since you ask nicely, the answer is " Supreme soveriegn authority ", i.e. the fact that governments are established among men to secure their basic rights -- i.e. they not left to individual whims to respect or violate as each pleases, in the model of classic anarchy. States are thus delegated by their People, with the power to to protect these rights through laws. I believe we've gone over this before ; you didn't understand it then, I doubt you will now... or ever. It's still true, however : ignorance is never disproof. If you form your own nation, you can name yourself the sovereign and construe the laws however you choose ; however that's neither here nor there.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So then you admit that the same " Supreme Sovereign authority " to which you would give the power to ban abortions today would be the same SSA to which you would give the power to require them in the future. Sorry, but we do not live in Jean Jacques Rousseau's world of the General Will. Rather, we live in the world of Locke's Social Contract. Now, try taking an equally impotent stab at the other questions. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And pregnancy is a social contract between man, woman and child, Mr. Pseudo-intellectual. The sovereign ENFORCES the social contract of proximate responsibility for free choice, otherwise it's anarchy -- as is patently obvious to anyone with an ounce of common sense. YOU'RE the one pushing the " General Will, " by arrogating plebiscite defensive rationalization of general WHIM. Go take an impotent stab at your mom, I'm done with you.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So sad. When your quiver quivers for the lack of the arrows of substance, thast you revert to vile ad hominems. Then again, not entirely unexpected ; righties do tend to carry a lot of anger in that quiver in lieu of arrows.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Whoever says such things is ignorant. Every abortion is done by a rapist. Anyone who allows an abortion is either a rapist or has been raped. Rape in its true meaning is to plunder, or to take wrongfully. It literally means to seize or take by force. Furthermore, it is an outrageous assault. Every baby aborted has been violated, and outrageously assaulted. How many lives have been taken by the force of the cunning currette? It is a practice we must stop. Every mother who has been to Planned Parenthood for counseling on a surprise or crisis pregnancy is the victim of fraud and her baby has been taken away by force ; which is rape. In my mother's case, when she refused to kill her own child, it was extraordinary because in today's world two rapes will make right. It is a lie. The Feminist for Life counselors counsel women pregnant as a result of sexual rape, and as these mothers receive counselling and support, they see the humanity of their children and are more at peace about giving them life. It is a wonderful thing to love instead of increase the violence. Abortion is plunder of the child's entire life and the woman's soul.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You cannot plunder what does not yet exist. Nor is a soul a matter of fact, either. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Do you exist?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>At present, yes. Not as a blastocyst, however. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You were once a blastocyst. You exist, and so what is your purpose in life? Jesus died for all and loves all that he has made. He gives life and life abundantly to all who believe in Him.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No, I was not. Nor was I once a gleam in someone's eye. Nor does that detract anything from my inherent worth as a human being who exists, at present. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Were you conceived?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>A human egg was fertilized. Eventually this develops into a person with an identity. In my case, who I am, today. But everything else you're putting on this is your own religious faith. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Everyone has an identity, everyone possesses traits of individuality. Everyone conceived is different and individual from everyone else conceived. You were conceived and eventually you will die.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Eventually, " I " as an entity began to conceive -- that is, " I " came into being. Though whether I was conceived -- as in act of intelligence by another -- is a question of faith. There was a fertilized egg -- that's all we can agree upon. And there is an awful lot of " coding ", if you will, in a fertilized egg. But " coding " is not a person at a later date. I can write a play. Put it down on paper. Without the actors playing their parts, however, it's just on paper. Yes, sooner or later, I will die. Cease to exist -- just as I did not exist at an earlier state in time. Except for matters of faith. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>You can write a play, perhaps, but can you write a double-helix DNA strand and have it accurate and meaningful? The common factor present in all living organisms, from bacteria to man, is the information contained in all their cells. It hs been discovered that nowhere else can a higher statistical packing density of information be found than that found in DNA. Who is the author of this DNA?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>This is a question of faith. There may not be any " author " in this respect. And, even if there were an author, he may have signed over the copyright. The woman is the person who has to decide, " Is this a production that's going to fly or not? And whether it is or isn't, do I want to go through this? " It's quite an undertaking -- and to dictate for others.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Maybe YOU can choose to ignore the possibility you raise, but I would hope that, upon reflection, you are as frightened by the possibility you raise as I. We are currently only about 5 states away from calling a Constitutional Convention on the issue of the tax code. This has been flying under the radar for many years now. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that such a Convention could just as well pass a so-called Human Life Amendment as it could pass a Required Abortion Amendment. There simply are no rules in either the Constitution or the statutes to guide such a convention. If it fell into the control of the demagogues, we could end up with their scenario.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Given current politics, the calling of a Constitutional convention is extremely unlikely. Perhaps it might be a point that is debated in the fringe press, but it has never made it to the mainstream press in any truly visible way ( ex. more than a couple of stray articles that very few notice ). If you think this is a real current risk, then prove it by citing numerous articles from the mainstream press. I do not bother being worried about events that have a negligible chance of coming true. I concentrate my efforts on the reality that we actually currently face. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The reality that we currently face is that you want to diminish the rights of actual women to choose whether or not to continue their pregnancies when the most that can be said about fetuses ( feti, Shooter? ) by some women is that they are at best potential people. Now, try to explain one more time why your particular POV should be law in the universe.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Funny. When you couldn't logically address the issue currently at hand, you reverted to changing the subject back to what we had ALREADY discussed. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Quite so. I am having great difficulty understanding WHY you think your opinion should be made law in the universe? Have you ever for a moment stopped to think that perhaps you could be wrong?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Of course I know that I could be wrong but I would have to be proven wrong through rational arguement, not just claims. Have you ever stopped to think that perhaps YOU could be wrong? Either way, we already discussed this issue of whether people can have opinions about abortion law. Perhaps you are having a " senior moment " and don't remember our discussion. I really don't feel like repeating this whole discussion all over again for your benefit. Indeed, you do seem to repeat your questions quite often. If you don't like someone's answer, don't just repeat the question - address their answer. If you don't remember our discussion, it started pretty much around post #861. Unless you have something new to say that we didn't already discuss, then I think we pretty much covered it and left it at a disagreement. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Nope, this is a very different topic altogether. It deals with the egoism involved when someone attempts to make her / his opinion into a universal. Under what claim of right do you do so?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Did you even bother to look at the discussion that started from post #861? Apparently not. Again, I gave my answers there. If you want to continue that discussion from where we ended it, or tap into some part of my answer that we did not address, fine. Otherwise, I feel no need to repeat the same answers I already gave to this same question that you pose. By the way, if you keep repeating this point in future posts without bothering to address the answers I already gave in that earlier discussion, then I will simply ignore those posts.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Please quit misconstruing what I am saying. One more time, and please read for comprehension this time. My position was, is, and always will be that it is the proper role of each and every pregnant woman to decide what value she gives to her fetus. If any particular woman believes that her fetus is a separate entity and she chooses to protect it with all the resources at her command, I support that. If another pregnant woman chooses to think of her fetus as disposable and acts on that belief, I support that as well. That's the true essence of the pro-choice position - the empowerment of women and the recognition that each and every pregnant woman is capable of making competent choices.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>One mans opinion.. good for him. Others have a different opinion... good for them. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Which is, of course the essence of the pro-choice position. :) Neither of us have the right to impose our opinions on others. Each woman must needs be able to formulate her own opinion and to act on it.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If others are of the opinion that they should impose thier opinion on others to preserve the life of an unborn child. That in itself is as valid a view as yours :) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not so. Their position requires the force of law for its support ; mine requires only that the law be silent. Be that as it may, " unborn child " is an oxymoron.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Only if one holds your opinion :) <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Really? Can you tell the forum how the profetallife position can become ascendant without massive legal intervention?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Your opinion is that the law be silent, other people have the opinion that the law should intervene. Two opinions... each with merit.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Which is, of course, the crux of the matter. Try as they might, the profetallifers who post here cannot get around that singular issue. In their Ivory Tower musings, they cannot seem to fathom the danger to the society if we grant to the nanny state the power to intrude on this simple fact. They can pontificate and bloviate all they want, but not a single one has been able to come up with a method of banning abortion that is necessary, desirable, and practical without invoking the heavy hand of the state.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It is " her body " before conception occurs. After conception there is an entirely individual body which intrinsically has a right to its own life ; it lives safely in its own womb until it is raped and violated and torn apart. Abortion is not avoiding birth, it is giving birth prematurely to a dead baby. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>NONSENSE!!! A fetus is just as much a part of a woman's body as a tumor, and she is free to remove neither, one or the other, or both as she chooses and as her free will determines.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Pure malarky. What is a body? No woman has two bodies. Every unborn child in its womb depends on its mother for nurturing. Why would anyone suggest that she go to a man wearing a white coat wielding a sharp knife to cut the child out of its place of comfort and protection. It is egregious that such a thing is promoted, and furthermore that she is expected to pay for it. No woman has two of every limb, organ and blood type! Stop promoting such foolishness! <br><b>S1:3-  </b>" Unborn Child " is an oxymoron. It's not a person unless and until it's born.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Who says? Those who plann abortions? Saying the unborn is nothing but a clump of cells is another one of their egregious lies.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Still more generalities do not answer the question. Can you please deal in specifics. After all, this is actions we are discussing that involve both the police power and the taxing power of the government. Hypothetical : If the USA outlaws abortion and Canada does not ( They always were more enlightened than we. ), do you advocate for pregnancy police at the border to check the status of every woman of child bearing age upon leaving and reentering the USA?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>No, I don't. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Don't ask, don't tell would seem to be your watchword then. " Killing of the defenseless " is OK with you just as long as it is done out of your sight. Doublestandarditis seems to be at work here.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This phrase is comprised of more than one word. No, it is not OK with me. Even if it is done out of my sight. That is not a word. Nevertheless, there is only a double standard if I advocate such methods in a similar situation, say if someone wanted to cross the border into Canada in order to murder a Canadian, or their born child. It's possible, yes. Should we stop each person leaving the country to find out whether that is their intention? No. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Thus you prove that everything I posted is the truth.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Except that you do not believe there is any such thing as truth, so no one can know what this gibberish means. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Why you old softie you. Whoever would have thought you would have been soft on crime, especially the " murder of the unborn ". All this time we thought that you would demand that we bear any burden, pay any price to bring an end to such depravity. Instead, you choose to hide behind your usual Jesuitical word games when you are cornered. Guess you were just funnin ' us all this time. Except that we are not laughing.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I'm not soft on crime. We should do what we reasonably can do. No one has successfully ended all murder of born people. Doesn't mean we don't have laws against it. To not realize, and admit, that there is a very real logical and philosophical problem in a claim to truth, when the claimant does not believe truth exists, is to simply belie one's sophistry. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Could have fooled us, what with your not even making an effort to determine whether a " crime " has been or is about to be committed. You're not even trying in this case. For Shame, Madam " Not Soft on Crime. " Yada, yada yada.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>When was the last time the police investigated you for murder? Oh, hasn't happened in a while? The police must be soft on crime, seeing how they haven't bothered to even " make an effort to determine whether a crime has been or is about to be committed. " You will see that all I have been arguing is that, should a law be passed, it be applied with the same rigor as similar laws. Go ahead and sing. No matter how loud the chorus, or annoying the song, you cannot change the fact that your arguments amount to one giant logical contradiction.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The crux of the matter when it comes to abortion, is that it is convenient    for whatever reasons. The problem arises, the moral problem that is, that what you are terminating is a process that if left to its natural conclusion would have had as a result a newborn human being. Abortion is against the nature of women, to defend it is to defend the antithesis of motherhood. The rationalisation to overcome this moral violation is to say that what one is terminating is not a human being, not a human life but an    it   . I don    t care much for the human race but I do care about suffering and that is why I am opposed to abortions that cause pain and according to the scientists, the feeling of pain begins about the end of the first trimester. If you want to commit murder, at least make sure the victim does not suffer.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That's o.k. Everything is a natural process. Women have abortions, so it is not against their nature. Women are not only parents. There are also a number of moral issues you are ignoring related to the rights of the woman, and responsibilities and consequences to real children. Like who is taking care of the newborn I just dropped, during coffee break, before heading back out to the fields. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>False, abortion is human intervention which is not a natural process. Oh! I thought it was against their nature and that only chose abortion because they had been raped or the child was unwanted or poor things there was no one around to care of the child when born. Now you are talking. I agree on that Let's concentrate on the matter at hand<br><b> S2:2-  </b>We are part of nature. Human intervention is quite natural. Your computer terminal is natural. Why don't you just suggest that we don't intervene in the natural course of a disease? Why use medicine for anything? Why think or invent? Why drive cars? Use washing machines? Communicate on the internet? This is all so unnatural. Why are you so intent on diminishing the reasons women have abortions or determine they are not in a position to bring a child into the world? Or, should I say, why are you so out of touch? Please do. ( See above. ) Don't you think women need to make a living? Uh -- let's say dad is deceased, missing in action, in jail, absent in some respect. Ok? This is the real world, Winston. So who is going to take care of the colicky newborn after the coffee break is over? Or is life only important to you when it's something imaginary, like this sci fi movie, " The Unborn ". When it's real people, actually born, why bother, at that point? Reality is much too troublesome. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I knew you would say that everything is natural. By the way if everything is natural ( according to you ) why bother to mention it. By natural I mean without human intervention, as in a natural death or natural birth as in not produced or changed artificially ( by human intervention ). Don    t try that semantic trick again, it doesn    t work on me. natural - definition of natural by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia. I am not I do Here you go again. I never said that life was only important when it's imaginary. Show the post where I said that. Real life? : " let's say... " " I just dropped a baby and headed for the fields... " are your jokes and hypothesis ' real life ' for you? By the way if I had made that joke about dropping the baby and heading for the fields you would have accused me of trivialising child birth, right?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Of course you don't. You just imply it. My point was that you do trivialize having a child. Should I call you Winston McCain? After all, he's a male candidate, and more importantly, both he and Palin are opposed to abortion. I was not a Palin supporter. Our political views are too different and I think she was unqualified for office. I voted for Hillary Clinton during the primaries and for Barack Obama in the general election. Interesting that you supported them, too, from Australia. Seeing as they are both advocates, in your eyes, of mass murder. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I don't I do not. as usual putting words in my mouth I only asked if your surname was Palin, for it happened that I was reading an article about her before entering the forum and you made that remark about chopping wood and shooting a deer, kind of a Alaskan frontier woman, nothing to with politics. I do not endorse invading another country under false pretexts and causing hundred of thousands of deaths. I don    t support banning abortion although I am against it for abortions will continue to take place no matter what and under terrible conditions. Abortion was just one of many issues during the election. I also supported Hillary but it was just out of ignorance I was not aware of how intelligent and capable Obama was. He was always against the invasion of Iraq, whereas Hillary Clinton joined the victory parade before the war even started. Hillary Clinton is too Clintonesque, namely poll driven. I saw a documentary about the Germans and the Romans ( first century AD ) and how a German priestess told the German leaders not to attack the Romans but they did    She survived, most of the men did not. I suppose she was a Germanic Cassandra<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Chester : I think that many adoptive parents are very much pro-lifers, but I don't think that need be a " condition " to be able to adopt. I also wouldn't impose just a " mere " fine, it would be a very stiff fine so both the doctor and the patient would pay. Can you put a price on the life of a viable fetus? No, but it would serve as a major deterrent.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Nice try but not the point. I am very much of the opinion that the decision belongs to the pregnant woman and her alone. Be that as it may, I am quite proud of my adopted son. He had some difficulties as a teen, but for the past 17 years he has worked at a job he loves and which brings him respect. The point is that your proposed compromise must include a provision REQUIRING so-called righttofetallifers to adopt. That will give them a real stake in what they are preaching. For the record, how does your proposal deal with the cases where a pregnant woman travels from her home state to another to terminate her pregnancy? How do you plan to deal with the woman who cannot afford to pay the " very stiff fine ", much less raise a child? Will you have pregnancy police at the border? What powers will they have? Can you not see the Big Brother implications of your seemingly oh-so-neutral compromise? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Chester : You appear to be the only one who wants to impose Big Brother regulations : Excuse me, but what if the pro Lifers are already responsibly rearing their own children? You're going to force them to adopt the offspring of the irresponsible? That's ridiculous. There are plenty of infertile couples in this country seeking to adopt. For God's sake, they travel to Russia and Vietnam to adopt children. Do you really think American couples would continue to spend upwards of $100,000 and deal with the red tape in those countries if there were more children available in our own country? I believe cash is good in any state of the union. Unless the woman could produce a police report evidencing rape or her home state doctor's report that the pregnancy was life-threatening ( in which case I doubt she would be traveling out of state ) she has to pay the additional fine to have the procedure performed, as does the doctor. Then that woman will carry the baby to term and her medical and legal costs to put the baby up for adoption will be offset by those who can afford to pay the fine. I'm pretty sure you know my opinion on illegal immigrants, pregnant or not. Btw Cappy, you DO know I was adopted at birth, right?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>What you call " Big Brother regulations " pale in comparison the the abhorrent concept that some nameless, faceless government bureaucrat is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is. All my compromise says is that those who protest against abortion should have some skin in the game. If they are already responsible parents, one more will not hurt a bit. If they're not, then they should keep to themselves. In the slum where I was raised, it's called putting one's self on the line. BTW, YOUR family history does not interest me in the least. What interests me is the success of my older son, whom we adopted at 4 months. For the record, we did spend the 1972 equivalent of the sum you quoted when we went to another country to adopt him another country, so don't sing that song to me. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Chester : Oh, but I have a lovely singing voice, dontcha know? Just think, my favorite little Marxist, under my proposal, you would have had your pick of healthy American babies to adopt and you could have contributed some of what you would have spent going abroad to the system that helped deliver them instead!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>There you go again, saying " Marxist " as though it were a bad thing, and as though it were relevant to this issue. BTW, there is no such term as " Pro-abortion " ; the correct term is " Pro-choice ". My point was, is, and always will be that a man has no right to an opinion on the topic ; it is a matter for the pregnant woman, in her whole discretion only.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Do pro lifers consider the ECP ( morning after pill ) a form of abortion? Interestingly enough i was watching a case on Boston Legal where a catholic ER doctor was being prosecuted because ( due to religious beliefs ) he failed to administer any emergency contraception after an unconscious, underage rape victim was admitted. His medical negligence, hindered by his religous beliefs resulted in the unsanctioned pregnancy of a minor. Does any pro-lifer agree with such actions?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So the Doctor saved a life and now he is being prosecuted? I thought that is what medicine is all about, to save lives. In my home country ( Chile ) where abortion is illegal, the morning after pill is legal. Why? Because we have a socialist government that declared it an anticonceptive not an abortive pill. Of course there were long and well reasoned debates by lawyers and doctors on both side of the abortion divide. ( not like this thread, apart from me, that is LOL ) To make a long story short : it was declared an anticonceptive, although stops an already fertilised egg from implanting in the uterus. The anti-abortion camp said it was an abortion for the egg was already fertilised. The pro-abortion camp said that it couldn    t be established ( no test is required to administer the pill ) so it was only a precaution as it also prevents or delays ovulation. In any case it is legal in Chile and I totally support it. I learnt so much about it following the debates in El Mercurio. I bet all those pro-abortions women in this thread have never had an abortion. A typical case of do as I say... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>He abused his position by behaving in a medically negligent manner to force his beliefs apon an unconscious, unwilling, sexually abused child. Needless to say he was successfully prosecuted and ordered to pay damages. A doctor is bound by the ethics of his profession whilst treating patients, not by his / her own religious beliefs. Amen to that! Or perhaps all the women on this thread are cases of responsible, diligent contraceptive behavior.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>A doctor is bound by her conscience not to perform an abortion if her conscience prohibits it. This is not only the case in the USA, but also in the UK and Canada. I think it is called The Right of Conscience Act. Freedom of conscience policies - medical organizations <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Perhaps, but this wasn't a case of a doctor not performing an abortion this was a case of a doctor not administering the ECP which intern caused an unconscious, violently raped minor to become pregnant. Either way she won her case big time.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>the point is he followed his conscience and that it what matters. the good thing is that at least in Illinois and the UK and Canada, they agree with Antonia that ' murder ' is a personal opinion and if that opinion is based on moral grounds it is legal to act according to one's conscience. makes sense doesn't it? :) <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I hope his conscious is free from guilt knowing he could have prevented a conception that inevitably ended up in abortion. There would have been no fetus to abort had he not been so negligent. In essence his lack of intervention on behalf of an unconscious, sexually assaulted child caused a pregnancy to result when one could have been prevented. He wasn't being expected to abort, he was however expected to prevent conception from occurring as within the treatment guidelines of every admitted rape victim. He willfully ignored this. The defense made him responsible for retribution of personal damages on behalf of the victim due to his negligence including now having to experience an abortion. Plus a multitude of other claims. The doctor created a situation for a procedure he was so against. Ironic. Like i said, they won, it turns out religious morality as a defense for medical negligence wasn't so legal after all. Medicine and its practice is legally free from religious morality. We cant exactly have mormon doctors running around refusing blood transfers can we?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Another opinion : Yes. If someone " supports " and " chooses " to stand behind an issue, whatever it may be, then that individual is exhibiting their free will to show that they are IN FAVOR OF, or PRO that position. Simple as that. Your failure to understand this very simple concept is bizarre.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Just like pro-choice is in favor of choice, not abortion. We don't choose abortion over life, nor life or abortion. We are for the choice and freedom of the person who is actually in the situation rather than the government. So, calling any choicer pro-abortion is inaccurate, however calling any lifer anti-choice is accurate, because they are against choice. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Wrong again, Kemosabe. Because you see, the woman who finds herself pregnant and CHOOSES to carry the baby to term, is making the far more difficult and honorable choice. The woman who CHOOSES to put her baby up for adoption to give it a better life than she can provide, is making the ultimate, unselfish, choice. The woman who CHOOSES abortion is the one choosing the selfish, easy way out.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>In your opinion, and not in all situations. In some situations. In other situations its the dumb choice. In your opinion, because you don't know what its like. You've never been faced with an unwanted pregnancy, and you cannot possibly know every American woman's circumstances when it comes to an unwanted pregnancy, therefore you are in no position to choose for her. And you did not refute my argument at all. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Shooterandproud : Oh, but I did. This was your argument : Whether you agree or disagree that the choices a pregnant woman who delivers a baby makes are more honorable and less selfish, is irrelevant. You have acknowledged that they are indeed, choices. Therefore, they are not against choice. They CHOOSE to have sex, they CHOOSE to go through with the pregnancy and they CHOOSE to give the baby up for adoption. They CHOOSE life.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are anti choice because you are against the choice of the woman to abort or not. And saying that by having sex you are giving permission to let a baby live in your stomach is like saying it is a cyclists fault for being hit by a car, because he chose to step outside and ride his bike. Therefore he deserves no medical attention. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Shooterandproud : Tell your health teacher he's fired. The baby grows in the mother's uterus, not her stomach. The uterus serves no other purpose in a woman's body than to serve her reproductive cycle. By introducing sperm to the egg that drops into a woman's fallopian tube, the resulting fertilization causes the fertilized embryo to attach itself to the woman's uterus to grow. Don't introduce sperm in there and an egg can't be fertilized.... duh! Btw, pre-natal care is very important for both the baby and the mother, therefore the only reason not to get medical care is ignorance. There are plenty of clinics and Medicaid for those too poor to have their own health insurance. And for all of those spandex bike riders who think they own the gosh darn road riding 3 abreast and not following the rules of the road, they DO deserve to get hit by a car. But hey, I'd call an ambulance for them anyway.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>She. That was a play on words, because when we were all little we thought the baby was in mommy's stomach. You have about a 25 - 35% chance of getting pregnant with unprotected sex. And cyclists are 11 times more likely to be killed on the road than a person in a car. http://www.daclarke.org/AltTrans/BikesDangerous.html Stay home instead of biking, and your chances of dying are dramatically decreased. " Care " being an abortion, because it solves the problem, just like if a biker is hit it'll solve the problem because he probably won't die if he gets care. Considering they're doing a service to you and this country by not emitting so much damn pollution you should be thanking them. I bike everywhere for three reasons : the environment, my health, and laziness so I won't have to get a driver's license. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Shooterandproud : Relax. Stating a fact is not belittling you. If you were to say to me, " You think like a middle-aged woman ", would that be belittling me? Now, if I were to say, " You think like a retarded child, " THAT would be belittling. But I've said no such thing. Furthermore, stating my argument has failed, doesn't make it so. ;-) And it would become easier and less expensive if more American babies became available instead of being tossed aside as biowaste. Uh, ok. You also ignored my point that many bikers today blatantly ignore the rules of the road, ( have unprotected sex ), ride 3 abreast ( selfishness ) and then sometimes get hit ( knocked up ). It's not a matter of do they get medical care or not. It's a matter of how do they choose to deal with the result of their irresponsible actions? It is " medical care " whether they go for the quick fix ( abortion ) or a longer hospital stay and rehab ( deliver ). But ask yourself this : If the biker can get a quick fix compared with a longer hospital stay, after he's all better, which situation would probably result in him riding 3 abreast again?<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You are quite inappropriately named on this forum. Be that as it may, not a single one of the profetallifers here has had the courage to tell the forum : 1. Who will police matters should abortion be outlawed? 2. How they will do so? and 3. The costs in actual tax dollars it will take to do so. All we see is pontification and bloviation about the sacred zygote. How about trying to live in the real world? Adopting one of the children you worked so hard to " save " might be a good first step. My oldest son is adopted, and that is a real world solution. Do you have the courage to take the same step?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Chester, who has gone by many other names on this forum before being banned, has actually had these and many other questions answered numerous times ( perhaps phrased differently ) but refuses to answer any questions posed to he / her. Nevertheless, I will answer the 3 non-relevant questions just because I wanted to respond to this post to remind everyone that Chester has been banned from these forums several times and should probably be ignored for the most part. Answers : 1. The police 2. The same way they did when abortion was illegal 3. Depends on how many people break the law. Probably similar to when abortion was illegal plus adjustments for inflation. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Still more generalities do not answer the question. Can you please deal in specifics. After all, this is actions we are discussing that involve both the police power and the taxing power of the government. Hypothetical : If the USA outlaws abortion and Canada does not ( They always were more enlightened than we. ), do you advocate for pregnancy police at the border to check the status of every woman of child bearing age upon leaving and reentering the USA?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I was specific.... but perhaps you want very specific ideas. I am actually flattered you want to know my specific ideas. I always knew you cared. Ok... my specifics for a poster who never answers anything. 1. Police from local level ( they normally wear a variation of blue uniforms ) and, when needed, certain FBI units similar to the way crimes are investigated today and very similar to the way it was done prior to 1973. 2. They will do so using the same tactics used by the police force in other crimes. This can include wiretaps, informants, people confessing, 911 calls, DNA evidence, the list goes on... perhaps you could watch an episode of CSI and get some ideas! 3. The cost question cannot be anymore specific as it is impossible to measure. What is the cost to police robberies? It depends on how many robberies occur in a given locality. For example if City x has 0 robberies in a year than the cost to that police force is 0. Surely someone as " enlightened " as Canada can figure this out... or maybe not. As for your forth question. I would say we should just outlaw visits to Canada. We don't want to run the risk of overwhelming their fantastic universal health care system. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If abortion is kept safe and legal, the cost, as well as the Draconian measures you propose, drop away. Is it really worth it to you to intrude in this manner on the most personal decision a woman can make? BTW, citing a report from the far right wing Fraser Institute does not add credibility to what you say.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Indeed. If you don't do something, you generally don't want to fund it. Is it worth it to you to intrude on my most personal opinion on the matter? The zero reports you cite still leave you with zero credibility. But who's counting<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Only if one holds your opinion :)<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The disturbing part of the pro-life argument is that it deems one opinion better than the other, then forces that opinion on those who don't share it. Its quite a slippery slope that's seen in almost all totalitarian governments. We should obviously legislate what we need to make society function and protect human beings from harm, but pointing to a sack of skin, calling it a human, and forcing a woman to squeeze it through her vagina is where the real immorality lies. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Once again, this your opinion. You are entitled to your opinion whatever it may be. What you are not entitled to do is feel that your opinion is so ' right ' that others cannot have a different opinion. I may trash your opinion, you may hate my opinion. So what! It is up to each of us to defend our positions and if we cannot maybe learn from others. for instance, you believe that a fetus is a sack of skin and the act of giving birth is squeezing this sack of skin through a vagina. ( the sack of skin then becomes a baby apparently ). This is your opinion. Oxymoron or not I prefer not to describe an unborn baby as a sack of skin and I feel that the fetus should be given some protection towards the end of the pregnancy. That is my opinion. The only opinion that should not be tolerated is that we should not have an opinion.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I am in completely agree, and the law should remain this way. You should be free to practice your opinion, and I should be free to practice mine. Don't like abortions? Don't have one. Simple as that. The law should respect both opinions, which is what I propose. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If a fetus is, as you believe, just a bag of skin then it would be absurd to curb an abortion. However if one believes that the fetus is a human in it's own right then an abortion would infantcide.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I don't see where you're going with this.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>If not, then on what grounds would you prohibit abortion late in a woman's pregnancy? What justification do you have for this? Is it or is it not " the killing of a child "? If it is, then it's murder ; if it isn't, you have no basis for banning it.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>We have produced solid medical evidence in other current debates that fetuses feel pain and even dream when sleeping, in the second trimester. I guess that means nothing to you huh? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>OK, let's assume you are correct. You are in favor of a law outlawing abortion, right? What sanction should the law demand for those who either have an abortion or perform one?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That's a whole other question and debate. The issue here is, if it is true that the question exists that they feel pain, and dream while in the womb, then shouldn't they be given the benefit of the doubt and we ere on the side of caution regarding how late in the pregnancy abortions are allowed to be performed? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>OK. So your objection is not to abortion per se, but only to the time at which it is performed. Welcome to the Pro-choice side of the issue.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You're an ignorant XXXXX cap 0, and it's a waste of time discussing anything at all with you. Rather than respond to the simplest question, you prefer to put words in my mouth.<br><b>S1:1-  </b>is it so hard for women to keep their legs crossed? the only women's leg openers I know apart from rape, are lust and / or money. :p<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Not at all fond of women, are you? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>On the contrary, I am prefer women to men. I find ( in general ) women more intelligent than men and less aggressive. I don't find my comment misogynist at all. What did I say that it isn    t true? I was reading in a magazine 8 reasons why women cheat on men and how they are better at hiding it than men. Men not only are not as good as women at hiding their infidelities but they only have one reason. No prize for guessing the correct answer. :)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I can only conclude that all sex is to you is getting away with infidelity. Rather a shallow take on the topic. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>not at all. I was just referring to what I read in a women's magazine that my wife left around. Don't tell me that some women don't cheat? I have nothing as I said against women. My daughter has a Master in Medical Science and soon she will begin studying for a Master in nursing. We go to art galleries together and she is much smarter than I. Would I say this if I hated women?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Why the devil do you keep harping on about women who cheat then? You seem obsessed with the idea of women being unfaithful. Why? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Do I? a touchy subject for you, Antonia and mae, among others? Don't tell me that some women don't cheat? I was just referring to what I read in a women's magazine that my wife left around ( written you would say by a woman obsesses with women cheating, and read by women obsessed with women cheating ) I also read in a New Scientist magazine that scientists have found that men suspect women of cheating even when there is no reason for it and also that women are better at hiding it than men. According to the scientists this behaviour is a product of evolution for males don    t want to care and raise children that are not their own. Why the female of the species cheat? The New Scientist didn    t say, so for that you need that women magazine and you being women know it better than I. So why women cheat, Simone, Antonia?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Why do men cheat? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I asked first : why do women cheat?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>But I certainly am not obsessed with cheating men. I don't constantly refer to cheating men. You, sirrah, are obsessed and you ought to do something about it. You could begin by considering the real fact that men cheat. So, why do men cheat?
