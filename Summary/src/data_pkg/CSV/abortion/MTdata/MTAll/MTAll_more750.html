If God can do anything, can he create a rock so big that He can not lift it? There..., YOU WIN!! Debate concluded.., no need to go on. As for my Christian brothers and sisters...., " Pearls before SWINE... " These people have absolutely no interest in knowing God or finding truthful answers to the preposterous questions they pose. Not one of them has ever truly sought God, though they know enough to fear the hell that may await them. From what little knowledge they possess comes the wellspring of hatred for the God they refuse to acknowledge and continue to deny through vein attempts by winning word games in the battlefields of thier own minds. There comes a time to shake the dust from your feet and move to a field whose harvest awaits you.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>True. That's why Jesus gave up on the prostitutes and tax collectors. Er, waitaminnit.... I'll leave it to " these people " to decide what they are or aren't interested in finding. But speaking as a Christian, I think their questions are entirely legitimate, and one can learn a lot by taking their questions seriously instead of dismissing them as uninterested in the truth. How do you know that? Indeed, how do you know that some haven't truly found him? Have you considered the possibility that maybe you are the one who isn't looking very hard? or that maybe, whatever you may think you've found, you are mistaken? I confess that I'm not sure " they " are the ones who fear that hell may awaith them.... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Matthew 10:13 - 15 ( New International Version ) 13 If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it ; if it is not, let your peace return to you. 14 If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town. 15 I tell you the truth, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town. You are very eloquent in your use of words and arguementation so it is not in my best interest to get into a jousting match with you. However, if you can not see the spirit behind these " questions " then perhaps you should look into your own vanity that motivates you to show everyone how smart you are?? Again I refer you to the spirit behind the " questions " Perhaps you should look into that...,<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Fair enough. If you feel debate is pointless, don't bother. Why not? You'll either come up with more rigorous ways of thinking about what you already believe, or you'll change your mind. Either way, you will be improved by the debate. - sigh - I have no doubt that some posters here have an antipathy toward religion. But of course, I think that is largely because so many religious people in this country refuse to take their questions seriously. Such religious believers attack the motives of the questioners ( and of anyone who takes their questions seriously, of course -- as here ). It is my contention that this thoroughly ad hominem tactic provokes the antipathy. If you choose to dismiss rather than to engage, and if you ( erroneously ) suggest that you're really not cut out for engagement, yet you nonetheless request that others acquiesce to your beliefs in the public arena -- well, I'm sorry but that is bound to get a strong reaction. And it's the sort of thing that has been happening in this country for decades. Instead of saying that you can't hack it with " words and argumentation, " why not give it a go? What are you afraid of? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>This was your response to my comment about casting pearls before swine... This is my comment about prostitutes and tax collectors... And then your response... Debate is not pointless when there is an audience to convince, regardless of the topic. The audience may be a judge, an onlooker, or one of the participants. If you have a " red letter " Bible, you will find the scripture above writte in red. In other words Jesus Himself instructed His disciples, ( who would later become apostles ), not to waste their time in pointless debate. Then He punctuated His statment with a curse. As I stated earlier about your use of words and your ability to argue, I don't have the time nor the patience the play word games or play with symatics. I never said Jesus " gave up " on anybody, nor was my comment concerning pearls, advising anyone to give up on a " seeker ". The comment WAS, however, directed at those who continually bash Christians whether the topic is abortion, homosexuality, or Sarah Palin. There comes a time to just walk away.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Right. According to the author of Matthew, who was not an eyewitness to the life of Jesus, who wrote these words approximately fift years after Jesus ' death, and who seems to have had liturgical purposes in mind as the Christian movement began to break away from Judaism and sought non-Jewish ways of understanding and expressing traditional Jewish ideas. Who's playing word games or semantics? Not me. To the contrary, I'd say that so-called " conservative Christianity " has been playing games with the Bible for over a hundred years now. Criticizing conservative Christianity is not equivalent to " bashing Christians. " As a practicing Christian myself, I assure you that this is last thing I want. Meanwhile, since when is Sarah Palin a " Christian " issue?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3791_227_224__229_233_244_257_263_264_265_266_296_300_306_307_7<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Might I suggest a little reading up on Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood. She promoted eugenics as a means of keeping the poor ( read blacks, Jews and other undesirables ) population down. http://www.lifeadvocate.org/1_98/feature.htm http://blackgenocide.org/sanger.html http://blackgenocide.org/negro.html http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/dickie-sanger.html<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Margaret Sanger does not speak for pro-choicers. Infact opinion polls in the US show that 68% - 70% want to keep Roe vs. Wade. Why is to soooo hard for you to accept that the reason pro-choicers want to keep abortion legal is only out of concern about the nasty consequences of making illegal. It has nothing to do with bigotry. One can say that it is you who is a bigot because it is YOU that has no concern for women's lifes if they are forced to go to quacks and butchers if abortion is made illegal. Where is your concern for women's lifes? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Margaret Sanger was one of the creators of pro-choice advocacy groups. Isn't it ironic that pro-choice advocates now try to distance themselves from their creator.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I know nothing about Margaret Sanger and I am not a member of any pro-choice advocacy group.... so your logic is insane to put it mildly. As I said 68% of the people want to keep abortion legal in the US.... are you saying that two thirds of the people in the US are bigots and murderers? Come on.... think carefully before you go aroung throwing accusations wildly. And I find your attitude towards women lifes callous and insenstive to say the least if abortion were made illegal. You don't seem to even show 1% of the concern for women that you show for yes.... a clump of cells. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Maybe you should look at more specifically targeted questions. http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm Only 25% favored unrestricted abortions. When asked if they supported late-term abortions, the results were 2 : 1 against. You don't know jack about my concern for women and women's lives. All you know is that I think that abortion is immoral. How you can determine that I have a callous attitude towards women from that little piece of information is beyond me. Or do you just make such statements thinking that it will further your position by weakening my character? Well, I've been down that road before. Bring on some facts and we can debate instead of hurl invectives at each other.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Here we go again - that 68% ( from CNN ) figure was for not overturning Roe Vs. Wade. If you don't like it too bad. I bet the CNN figure is more likely to be accurate than what you have quoted. The fact is two thirds of the US public does not want to go back to the days of back alley abortions and quacks and butchers performing abortions... Is that so hard for you to accept? I will say this again - you want to make abortion illegal, which means you don't give a damn about women who will be forced to go to quacks and butchers if that happens. Don't you get it? we don't live in a perfect world.... so you think abortion is immoral... guess what many pro-choicers might think that too but they also recognise reality and know that making abortion illegal will result in women's lifes being put in jeopardy if abortion goes underground. So you have no concern for women if you don't take that into consideration. You live in a world of absolutes, but life is more complicated than that.... <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I'm all in favor of abortions if the woman's life is in danger and she choses an abortion. But the fact is that most abortions are gotten out of convenience and not real need. I've posted the stats a number of times, so you can see for yourself that all but a few % are for self-serving, selfish reasons.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>So what can we do about that? We cannot legislate morality. I do agree with you that sometimes pro-choicers overlook this fact that there is far too many abortions done out of convenience than real need. Yes it is a sad fact but what can anybody do about it... we just have to chose the lesser of two evils. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>We don't have to accept the lesser of two evils. And we legislate morality every day, what's new about that? Public nudity, pornography, prostitution, drugs, the list is endless.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>The difference between these examples you have cited and abortion is that a woman's life will be put in jeopardy if abortion is made illegal. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>As I said, I have no problem with allowing abortions when the mother's life is in jepoardy. If you're talking about backwoods illegal abortions, then that's their choice.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Backwoods abortions is nobody's choice. When abortion was illegal in the US, backwoods abortions did take place because women had no choice but to go to quacks and butchers. We don't live in a perfect world, women will abort no matter whether abortion is legal or illegal. So the question is whether to keep it safe and legal or illegal and unsafe. And you sir, are in no position to sit on judgement on women who abort because you will not be the one responsible for the child's welfare if born..... So unless you are willing to take responsiblilty for all the children that are born unwanted because you will only permit abortion when the mother's life is at stake, I suggest you keep your morals to yourself. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>I'd be more than happy to take responsibility for EVERY baby that I sire. In fact, I have three. You want to remove the element of accountability because you don't like it. Too bad! And you want it to remain legal because it will occur anyways? What kind of twisted logic is that? Should we make incest legal? After all, it's going to occur anyways.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>Well, did making incest illegal result in women's lifes being put in jeopardy? Because making abortion illegal sure will!</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3791_54_53__60_62_63_68_71_73_76_86_88_90_91_92_94_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>... We could go on like this for days... but in the end all one can say is that science has no real conclusion...<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Incorrect : science offers a conclusion, that life is a continuum. This isn't much use for the " when does life start " debate though, so you ignore it. The beginning of the universe? The point at which life started here on earth ( another " line in the sand " issue as there would have been no one single point )? The point at which the egg and sperm that together formed the zygote that became you began their lives? The start of the fertilization process? Which " earliest possible point " are you going to arbitarily choose? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Science doesn't offer a conclusion though!! How many articles do I have to post in order for you to believe this? What about the testimony of the doctors that went to Congress??? Dr. Hymie Gordon ( Mayo Clinic ) : " By all criteria of modern molecular biology, life is present from the moment of conception. " Dr. Micheline Matthews-Roth ( Harvard University Medical School ) : " It is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception " Dr. Alfred Bongioanni ( University of Pennsylvania ) : " I have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception. " and look... another opinion of a doctor http://www.lifeissues.net/writers/ki...febegins2.html I mean, we seriously could ask every doctor and never get a good answer.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I'd hope not. None of those doctors offered a scientific answer by today's standard, but hopefully some are capable of it. If you want a scientific answer then perhaps one should ask a scientist and not a doctor? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Are doctors not included in science either? I don't know if I can go with that one.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>As zachvac says, if they are just expressing opinion, eg " I have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception. " then tere is no science to it. If they have used the scientific method though ( such as experiments that reveal " conception " isn't an instant event ) to come up with their conclusion, then it is science. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You really have the worst definition of science I have ever heard. One does not need to be doing the " scientific method " in order to have findings or be a part of science. A pscyhologist is without a doubt part of science... sometimes they do use a " scientific method " and sometimes they don't. However, it is still a science either way.... just like a doctor<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I also have the most accurate. Whether you therefore like it is irrelevant. Incorrect. Without the use of the scientific method, it ain't science. Full stop ; end of discussion. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I gave you an example... pscyhology is science.. and they don't always use the scientific method. Science means so many things.. I don't know where you are getting this stuff from.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Phychology is a science in some regards, as the scientific method can be used in some experiments to test hypotheses. However it, like other aspects of medicine is constrained by ethical issues surrounding experimenting on people ( especially children ). Therefore much of it is based upon medical empiricism, not science. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>once again, you don't need the scientific method to be considered a science. If you don't believe this, then so be it... but first thing you learn about psychology is it is the science of behavior ( among others ). Science doesn't mean scientific method... all the scientific method is, is a way to conduct an experiment. I know a psychologist ( which is a science ) that comes out with results of things all the time... He doesn't use the " scientific method " yet it is still science. So no matter how much we go threw this in the end science has no real answer on when life begins.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>It depends how loose you want to be with the word. If you consider the humanities such as sociology and economics as sciences, then the word becomes next to meaningless. It is much like calling a " garbage collector " ( as I think you call them in the US ) a " refuse collection engineer ", as this renders the word " engineer " meaningless. If it doesn't employ the scientific method, then it is at best " theoretical science " and at worst it is pure psuedoscience. And so we go around full circle : of course science has no real answer on when life begins as science regards life as a continuum <br><b>S1:7-  </b>Sigh, this conservation is obviously worthless. Eventhough I have shown how science views differ you refuse to look at them. Science is a loose word. Why do think there are so many opinions? Really now, who do you think these people are? You think there is a company called " We Do Science " and all they do is scientific method on things? No. Lots of research is done at universities and companies that do other things. Here at my work ( which is a university ) we have a College of Science and a College of liberal arts and human sciences. Some Departments : Biology Biology -- Fralin Biotechnology Center Biology -- Microbiology Chemistry Economics Geosciences Mathematics Physics Psychology Statistics Large Animal Clinical Sciences Biomedical Sciences and Pathobiology Then we have the The College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Agricultural Technology Agricultural and Applied Economics Agricultural and Extension Education Animal and Poultry Sciences Biochemistry Biological Systems Engineering Crop and Soil Environmental Sciences Dairy Science Entomology Environmental Science Food Science and Technology Horticulture Human Nutrition, Food, and Exercise Plant Pathology, Physiology and Weed Science And look at all the jobs you can have in Science http://www.sciencejobs.com/search.action?reset=true I mean come on now... I don't make this stuff up Political Science<br><b> S2:7-  </b>I am fully aware of that. The meaning of the word " science " has been steadily eroded over the years : you are not the first to use it in a meaningless way. I prefer to stick to using the word in a way that gives it meaning, not the ridiculous modern trend of calling vacuum cleaning and cooking " domestic science " etc. If you choose to see ironing shirts as a real science, then you are a fool and this conversation indeed no longer has any worth. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>I'm not sure what to tell ya... it is what it is. Science has no answer for beginning of life or if life is a contiunum. Depends on who you talk to like I said to start out with.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-5289_88_87__89_91_96_97_98_100_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Wrong, wrong. I'm pro-choice ; which means I promote choice. If a rape victim wants to continue her pregnancy, that's fine with me. If she wants an abortion, that's fine with me. Choice. I'm not promoting abortion. And I've said that before. It's relevant b / c I want you to know that sex doesn't always guarantee pregnancy. I should have quite a bunch of kids at this point if that were the case. You don't go to school? Man, how'd you get so lucky? So if you're not pushing and promoting your personal beliefs and morals, what are you doing? Don't people disagree with your opinions on what is moral? How do you reconcile that?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You promote choice, but not abortion? Isn't the particular choice you support the choice to have abortion? I don't think you can support the one without supporting the other at the same time. It doesn't guarantee pregnancy. But it happens frequently enough. Enough to consider what will happen if it does. Huh? Sure they do. And there are some that agree with me too. Obviously, in an abortion issue, personal beliefs have to be included. There are people out there striving to say an early baby is not a person. That is a personal view. Plus, there is a personal view that the baby is a person from conception. Those are personal views, but currently the first one made the law. Only pro-lifer are poked in the chest because of their personal views when the pokers themselves don't even realize the reasons that make them pro-abortionists stemmed from their own personal views. So lets stop this personal view thing, pro-abortionists act the same way. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I support women's choice ; to do with their bodies as they please. I'm not walking around town carrying signs that say " Have an abortion, they're great! " or " Everyone should have an abortion! " or " Choose abortion! It's the best choice! " I support women's choice ; no matter what that might be. People can make their own personal decisions without my involvement. Friends can come to me, and I'll support their decisions, even if I don't agree with it. ( You said " Huh " to my question ; " how did you get out of school? " ) I meant, really, how did you get out of going to school, you lucky bug? :) I don't think you understand what it means to be pro-choice. You're pushing your morals on the masses. I'm want people to choose their morals. If I was pushing my views, I would be telling people to get an abortion, like you're telling people not to. Instead, I'm encouraging society to allow people to make their own decisions. Does that make sense? It's been a long day.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Oh, I get it now. I though when you said " pro-choice " you meant the choice to have an abortion. I see now. I do homeschool work. I do study math, english, science ect. My Mom chose to do homeschooling because of personal reasons. Allowing people to make their own decisions is fine. That I agree with. I guess I have a better understanding now of how the pro-choice person is. But I still hold my belief that morals play a part in this issue, whether it's constitutional or not. There is eventually going to be a moral absolute in the ultimate debate on this, regardless of moral-less people. The law is already built on morals, I don't think anything unconstitutional would be commited by prohibiting it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Could you please clarify what you mean when you say " moral-less people "? What is a moral-less person? ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Currently, the law which you say " is already built on morals " allows for abortions. So... maybe you'd like a chance to reconsider your statement :<br><b> S2:3-  </b>A person without morals. Remember that I said morals. I did not say " good " morals or " my " morals. The fact is that it is, trying to completely obstruct morals from the law is futile. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I've never met or heard of a person without morals. Have you? I'm sure you mean people without what in your opinion are " good " morals. ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><b> S2:4-  </b>If you're confused by my last post, I'll explain it. Trying to use a moral to impose a law will never work. Morals are included, but if you gave that as one of your main reasons for creating a law, they would never allow it.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3483_102_94__105_108_109_111_112_113_117_118_120_122_123_142_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>We are not the ones who need something to get us through the night. Remember we are the ones who care more for a living human being than a clump of cells.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>you are a clump of cells <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Coming from you, I guess thats a compliment. Likewise.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I am... It wasn't really a compliment or an insult... you just happen to be a clump of cells... lots of cells. What do you think you are made of? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Which means you must be a clump of cells too. The question is whether you have a brain and heart like the rest of the posters in this forum and every other breathing human being.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I am a clump of cells... those were the first words of my last post. So do you have to have a brain, heart, and be breathing to be a human? Who set this rule? Some people have smaller brains then others.. are they " less " of a person? During a heart transplant is that person not a person when their heart is removed? If you hold your breath are you not a person? Your standard can't be proven nor does it make sense. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The point is even if they have a smaller brain, they still have a brain. And the point is even in a heart transplant, the person has to get a heart to live. No heart, the person dies. And the point is even if you hold your breath, you have to breath after sometime to live. No breathing for a more than a few minutes and you die. None of these examples are in any way comparable to a fertilized egg. The fertilized egg does not have any brain ( small or otherwise ). Even if you transplant a heart into a fertilized egg, it cannot survive in the open. has heart and still dies. Has no lungs to even hold its breath........ Boy what an absurd comparison!<br><b> S2:4-  </b>A fetus has a brain, heart, and doesn't have to breath to live. If you talk about a fertilized egg then we still get back to the question who makes you the determiner of what a human is? Just because someone has to be in a certain enviroment to live shouldn't make them any less of a human. However, I don't get to make that call for someone else either. So I suggest that only each of us can determine for ourselves only whether or not we are a human at that point in time. Can't ask a fertilized egg? well better play it safe until you can... not have the ability to say is not a pass to make the decision for him / her. If it is a human / person ( or whatever ) one can't morally or legally kill it ( legally stated in roe vs wade for US only ). Morally, I would say most people find the killing of an innocent to be wrong. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I did not even mention the word ' fetus ' in my reply to you...... so I am puzzled why you used that word. As I recall I was writing about a fertilized egg.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>ok? are you offended or something? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>My question remains unanswered.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>which was? <br><b>S1:7-  </b>Why you used the word fetus, when I was talking about fertilized eggs.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>because I felt like it...</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3483_131_125__136_138_141_152_154_161_164_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Ok for the sake of arguement, lets say that abortion is made illegal. What is going to happen, abortions are still going to take place, only this time instead of going to doctors, women will be forced to go to butchers, which will result in abortions plus women's lives being put in jeapordy. The rich will always do what they always do and will not be affected by it. Does this accomplish anything rather than making you feel better that abortion is illegal. It is ridiculous to compare abortion to murder. Murder is not a medical procedure. Abortion is a medical procedure which if performed by a quack or a butcher carries with it the risk of death, infertility and other complications.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Abortion is not murder? What about the baby being aborted? Abortion is controversial for the simple fact that many people consider the procedure murder. Many doctors in Germany during WWII committed murder by experimenting on human subjects. They knew beforehand that death would be the outcome, such as seeking to determine how long a person would survive at simulated high altitudes, and all for a good cause, by the way, to save the life of pilots. ( utilitarian ethics ). And many of these results were used by doctors belonging to the Allied countries without qualms, but this is another ethical issue. So medical practice can be murder. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Now you are confusing torture with abortion. So you consider a fertilized egg of say 3 weeks a baby. It has not developed any human organs yet, how can it feel pain? The example you gave above is of doctors torturing breathing human beings by performing medical experiments on them. Lets not confuse the two issues here. One is torture, the other is a medical procedure to abort in most cases a ' clump of cells ' which has not yet developed human organs and hence cannot feel any pain. Whether you consider abortion ' murder ' depends on many factors such as religion, morality, etc.. and also the development stages of the fetus. In fact in some countries once the fetus starts to develope human organs, abortion is not permitted whereas in other countries abortion is permitted right up to 9 months..... But I would not equate the aborting of a fertilized egg of 3 weeks with the murder of a breathing human being by say shooting him / her. Totally different.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Don    t accuse people of confusion when you are confused. Torture is to inflict pain on a person as a form of punishment or to induce the person to behave in a certain manner, for instance to force the person to confess. Pain in the medical experiments I referred to was not intentional but a consequence of the experiment. The Nazis did not resource to experimentation to cover torture. If they wanted to torture people they simply tortured them. Don    t you think that the baby killed by being forcibly torn from the womb suffer pain before dying? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>That fact that you are confused is plain for everyone to see, infact your name should be ' confusion reigns ' Torture is torture whether intentional or unintentional. What are you saying in your usual confused manner, that just because in the medical experiements, torture is unintentional, it is not torture? Please clarify what you mean by a ' baby " being aborted ( we don't have to use your gruesome description here ). So you think a fertilized egg of say 3 - 6 weeks which has not developed any human organs can feel pain when aborted? Now suddenly you have started using the word " baby "? is this for the purposes of being melodramatic? Yeah sounds a lot like those melodramatic SA soaps we see on TV where there is a meltdown every five minutes.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Why don    t you consult a dictionary before trying to debate an issue? To torture is to intentionally cause pain, if not, it is not torture. For instance reading your postings is painful but whether this constitutes torture or not depend on your intentions. Abortion is a medical procedure that causes the death of the foetus by forcibly removing it from the womb. Whether this constitutes murder or not depend on the point in time it was performed. According to some persons in these Forums if it happened before the foetus became a person, no murder occurred. I don    t give a hoot about sterile semantic discussions ; in my opinion if the foetus feels pain it an abortion should be not allowed and the pregnancy should continue. Now if the mother doesn    t want the baby then an adoption would be the solution. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>1 ) Yes, yes, yes! my postings are definitely meant to torture you. What goes around comes around. 2 ) Is destroying an embyro in a petri dish in the science lab murder? If that is murder to you, then you should be against stem cell reasearch otherwise you have a double standard. 3 ) Easy for you to make comments about abortion and tell women what they should do ( like giving up the baby for adoption ) as you will never find yourself faced with any of these decisions.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>At least I am not the only sufferer, I can see other poor souls around here also the victims of your postings. Who said that laughter wasn    t painful? It is if in excess, therefore I only read one of your postings at a time to make the pain bearable. How is the    clump of cells    doing today by the way? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I guess you are a expert on this subject - torture. You have a lot of experience in this area ( I have witnessed it and been a victim of it many a times ). But don't worry about me, your kind of germanic torture which is the inflicting of excruciating pain and mental anguish can never be surpassed by ANYBODY. Maybe the reason you can only answer one of my postings is because my other postings are so logically constructed, flawless and above all right on the mark, so you cannot answer them... to answer them you will have to admit that you were wrong.

I guess sarcasm is not known here.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>But the fact that you don't need a license from the UN has nothing to do with what I accused you of begging the question for. It was for the phrase " killing Someone. " ( Whether it is someone being killed, not something, is the sticking point of the abortion debate ). I understand that you do not actually believe the part about the UN. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>my mistake I thought you quoted something else... either way.. it is still not begging the question as my conclusion was not basis for my premise.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>What the hell are you talking about? Look, let me lay it out for you : 1. The critical sticking point between the two sides of the debate is, is the fetus a morally considerable thing? ( or, a " person, " or a " someone " ) 2. To assume the sticking point of an argument to make that argument, or an argument in support of your side of the sticking point is called " begging the question. " 3. You assumed that a fetus was a someone when attempting to refute a point related to the abortion debate's sticking point. 4. Therefore, you begged the question. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>with that poor standard of what " begging the question " means you do it all the time. You assume that the sticking point is what you said it is in your arguement so by your standard you begged the question yourself.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>That is the standard, and if I do it, you should call me on it. I understand that to be the sticking point. If you do not think that it is the sticking point, then I wish you would tell me what the actual sticking point is. If you cannot tell me what the actual sticking point is, then you are wrong in your assertion, and you should apologize. Were you not? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Some believe a right to personal autonomy is over a right to life... so they believe it is a human but that is below the " right " to personal autonomy. So you are making an assumption about the sticking point being what you say it is. Either way, you are using " begging the question " incorrectly in my opinion so I am not gonna call you on it because that is not what it is. You already assumed I was, so too late for corrections.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Good point. However, I think this approach is marginal at best. That's true, I am. However, making an assumption is not the same thing as begging the question, which is a particular type of assumption. Then your opinion would be contrary to fact. If you want to call me on it, I suggest you reread the entry first. You didn't answer my question. You said I assumed X. If X is the case, then this is not a problem. The problem comes up when X is not the case, or X is under dispute. So I ask you again, was I wrong? Do you disagree?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-1410_106_104__111_112_115_116_117_121_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Sigma, Yes, I said that and I was quoting you. Please try to keep up with your own posts :) You said that a woman's physical, emotional, and mental status should not be sacrificed so that another could live. I think that the baby's physical, emotional, and mental status should not be sacrificed so the mother can maintain her current living situation.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Trust me, I know what I said, even if I realize I misspoke later on. Since you do not believe the fetus ' physical, emotional, and mental state should be sacrificed, why do you believe that the woman's should be? Arguably so. Pulling the plug could be described as both. Again, arguably so. A STD and a pregnancy are both possible consequences of sex. On one, you argue " they consented to the possible consequences of sex " on the other you believe they should be able to be treated. It is a contradiction. Even though one is a human life, both are subject to the same argument, so if you believe one but not the other there is something wrong with the argument. I am glad you agree :) I do not understand, then, why you wish to force motherhood on women, which seems counterproductive to wishing motherhood be wanted. Nor do either of us apply it :P It is up to the doctors to decide. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Sigma, I saw an opening for a quick jab so I took it Fly like a butterfly... I was playing on your words. I was implying that the fetus ' physical, emotional, and mental state are irrevocably obliterated whereas the mother's physical, emotional, and mental state are temporarily altered. I think something is wrong with an argument that compares treating an STD with killing a fetus. You think they are similar?. Motherhood should never be viewed as a punishment or as being forced. We should work to have people thinking of pregnancy and children as a blessing / gift no matter what the situation is. The manner in which one becomes pregnant should not mar the view of the child that results.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>;) Temporary, perhaps. It depends on the situation. I don't believe removing her rights, even on a temporary basis, is morally right. They are similar in some ways. I am comparing the ways that they are similar, since your argument can be used for the ways they are similar ( ie, they are both consequences of sex ). The only way that everyone would view them as such is if there are no unwanted pregnancies. I believe that will only happen if women have the right to stop pregnancies that they do not want. Then each child that is born is a wanted child. If the pregnancy is required after a rape, I do not see how you can expect that the woman will simply forget about the rape while pregnant. Requiring that the woman continue the pregnancy by law is legislating a consequence that the woman may not want. I do not see how that is not punishing the woman. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Sigma, Her right to kill is not legitimate. Killing a child and treating an STD are two very different actions. The best way might be to value sex as more than a casual pleasure and recognizing the fruit of sex. I don't think the child should be punished for the rape. The woman will never forget a rape but I don't think the woman is being punished by allowing a child to live.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Legitimate to whom? How to change thier condition does change. I have not argued differently. However, your argument excludes treatment for both. Your argument does not mention how to stop or change their condition, it focuses on the fact that they accepted to the possibility when they had sex. Perhaps. Outlawing abortion will not do this thing. It will only recognize the fruit of sex as superior to the woman carrying it. More philosophically, why should sex be more than an expression of love and the pleasure of physical contact? Only the woman. I believe that if it is legislated and is undesirable, it is being used as a punishment. I find it morally reprehensible that you believe that she should be forced to continue a pregnancy because of rape. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>To anyone. The court had no right to grant a right to kill. The court had no right to void the foundation of our forefathers in recognizing the right to life as inalienable. Treating an STD and killing a child are two very different actions. Not superior. Equally valuable. Why should it be more than an expression of love and pleasure? Because it is more than an expression of love and pleasure. It has an inherent function of producing children. No. I do not believe that a woman should be forced to continue pregnancy because of a rape. I believe a woman should continue a pregnancy because of a child. I believe that she should continue her pregnancy in spite of rape.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Certainly legitimite to me, and I daresay to the majority of America. Our " forefathers " gave those rights to all those who fall under the constitution. You're very neatly avoiding the question Not equally valuable. When the fetus is granted the right to live in her body against her will, it's rights to her body are superior to hers. And we should never interfere with any natural process, is that it? Care to back that up? You say that we shouldn't punish the fetus for the rape, but it is very probable that you will be delaying and preventing her physical and mental recovery, and with that daily reminder of what happened she may never be able to forget. I would call that punishing the woman. Poor wording on my part I apologize. I believe it is morally wrong to force a woman to continue a pregnancy that was a result of rape. Physical, emotional and mental recovery should take precedence, not the forced delivery of something she does not want, that perhaps will remind her of what happened 9 months ago that she was trying to get past.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-5983_51_49__52_53_54_55_63_57_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>This is going way too far off.

I guess the first question is... how do you define " right to your own body " Furthermore, we seem to place more value on a " life " anyway.

Well yes, pro-choice thinks the mother has rights, pro-life thinks both have rights. So you shoulda said " think the fetus has rights too ". Not even close to like rape but if you like to do that then I can just say abortion is like murder... so you have a choice between murder and rape. Great choices. Huh? Your statements ( together ) are starting to border on a strawman. Certainly not unconstitutional but what does outlaw condom and birth control pills have to do with anything? I never mentioned birth control.... starting a strawman here. Should you kill everyone that is unwanted? If you are unwanted can we kill you without punishment? If a 2 month old baby is unwanted can they kill him or her? Selfish to kill for your personal gain. The fetus didn't have a choice to be " sucking her resources ".

That's true conservativism... equal opportunity for all.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Maybe that's because there doesn't need to be a " threat " to heterosexual marriage in order for the government to ( justifiably ) recognize one form of marriage over the other,... and to remain indifferent to all the variations. One man one woman marriage is the template that best fits the " general welfare " concerns for the government. ( As generally speaking our society is built upon the one man one woman marriage and family structure ) Marriage must be defined by our government ( article 1 section 8) for the purposes of making imigration and naturalization laws,... in addition to property rights laws and such regarding divorce, inheritence, etc. It's simply a matter of " man's law " following " natural law " IN THE GENERAL SENSE. No matter how much the outcry, gays and gay marriage is not the natural " norm " of society. It's hilarious, how those who DENY the very personhood of a pre-birth child demand the rights and recognition of gays to marry,.... and they use a thread about abortion of all places to do it. I shouldn't say it's hilarious,... But I'm at a loss for a better word. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Then why is are they called marriage ' protection ' laws and the Defence of Marriage Act?

No the ' norm ' will always be divorc   e lol. I don't deny personhood of pre-birth children, but I support a woman's right to control her body.

Yet you would do the same later in the pregnancy. Therefore we both use force. Why did you bother to state that I force if not to suggest it is wrong?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Though I would like to finish this particular discussion, this question at least moves the discussion forward. I talked about abortion in the early trimesters being a responsible answer to unwanted pregnancy and that it has the advantage of letting the woman choose whereas you would force her. I will grant you that, since I did not specifically say in that paragraph that I would allow abortion to be outlawed ( i.e. pregnancy forced ) in the third trimester ( though I have said it in many other posts ), that might have left room for you to jump to conclusions that I think all such force is wrong. So, just to get this discussion over with, I'll strike a compromise : You were wrong for jumping to conclusions and I was wrong for leaving things unsaid which made it easier for you to jump to those conclusions. Fine? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Not an acceptable compromise, I was left with no other conclusion than to interpret your comment as though I was wrong for using force, yet your own use is not. It was clearly double standards.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The conclusion which you jumped to was that I think all use of force is wrong. You jumped to this conclusion based on my claim that use of force in this particular situation ( early trimesters ) is wrong. I cannot be blamed for your extrapolation. I have presented a reasonable compromise that you have rejected. I see that there is no way to reach an agreement so, unless you introduce some new compelling arguement, I will just drop this discussion. I, and probably any others who might still be reading this, no longer find any usefulness to the discussion. Bye - onto other threads / subjects. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So what you want me to accept is : You can use force when you like, but if I use force, it is wrong, and you will not debate any more unless I accept this. You don't know how to debate.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Please don't misrepresent my view. I said that the use of force ( through law ) has to be justified. I generally like freedom so I think the use of force should be avoided unless it has justifications. You are not wrong in using force because it is you who said it. If you present good justifications for the use of force in outlawing abortion in the early trimesters, then that use of force would be valid. However, I haven't seen good justifications coming from you. Of course, all of our opinions on what is a just arguement and what isn't are based on our own views. You might think my use of force in wanting violent anti-abortion protests curtailed unjust. The justice or injustice of our views has to rest mainly on our arguements. Personally, I would prefer to delve more deeply into these arguements than to continue this discussion ( which I have broken my own intentions in continuing - mostly because I would prefer not to leave the discussion on a misunderstanding of my arguements ). <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I'm not misrepresenting your view. You said I was wrong for using force, yet you claimed the use of force is right when you use it. That is a fair summation of the debate. You didn't claim I was wrong for any other reason other than force. It is double standards.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I said you were wrong in using force *** IN THAT SITUATION***. That doesn't mean that I think it is wrong for you to use force in any situation. Also, I did not claim the use of force is right whenever I use it. Neither of us can justify the use of force unless we present valid arguements to support that force. If you want to discuss those arguments, I would be happy to. At least such a discussion will serve a purpose. I am convinced now that you will not stop misinterpreting my views until you get me to admit to something I am not guilty of - that is something I am unwilling to do. I see we will have to agree to disagree - at least I see that we will continue to disagree. I have little doubt that you will keep harping on this issue. I personally see now that there is no hope in resolving this issue so it is best to drop it. Again, I am willing to go into discussions on justifiable reasons for using force through law where abortion is concerned. As for this inane arguement, I really am stopping my participation here since I need to log off and leave the computer. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Exactly, so I'm not wrong on those grounds, you need to find a reason why I'm wrong, if there is one, you have yet to present it. Then, and only then can you mount an argument to claim I'm wrong, until then please don't make inaccurate accusations.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-6408_293_292__296_298_299_306_308_310_311_312_313_314_315_316_317_320_321_322_324_333_335_341_342_343_344_345_346_350_355_357_358_5<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Well I think it is highly unlikely that I would miss the point on every single one of your comments all of a sudden, just as it so happens that I bring the debate to a conclusion. You were quite happy to accept my earlier comments, when it looked slightly less gloomy for you. Let me wrap things up : A human is a person, I think we both agree on that, the dictionary is very clear about it. An unborn is a human therefore it is a person. Killing people in the millions is genocide if the reason is to kill them for convenience. If killing the unborn is killing people than it is hardly necessary for me to prove the the unwanted unborn are an ethnic group in order to prove their deaths amount to genocide, regardless I have you that they are. I could also show how they fit the description of other formats to include them as an ethnic group. In fact it is easier to show that the killing of the unwanted unborn is genocide, than it would to show the same conclusion of all black people, so you demonstrated, since you failed miserably to prove it.

Look at every example of genocide ever perpetrated, those that died were inconvenient. Or are you claiming that they are convenient, and their deaths were just for fun?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You've shown that in your logic that abortion = genocide, if it's done mainly for convenience. I do not agree that abortion is done mainly for convenience, therefore, by your logic, I do not agree that abortion = genocide. That's why I was suggesting more clarification on " convenience ". <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No, I have shown that this is true regardless, the killing of the unwanted unborn is genocide. I have shown that killing in the millions is genocide. I have also shown the killing in the millions for convenience is genocide. Why did so many Jews die in WW 2? They were inconvenient. Why did so many Kurds die at the hands of Sadam? They were inconvenient. Why do so many Unwanted unborn die? They are inconvenient.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Your statement was that... " Killing people in the millions is genocide if the reason is to kill them for convenience ". You have not defined ' convenience ' in the case of abortion. Therefore, you have not shown concretely with your logic how abortion = genocide. I would be interested in your proof that the ' unwanted unborn die because they are inconvenient '. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Why are they killed then? I would be interested to know?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Let's not get sidetracked. You need to define convenience for your equation ( abortion = genocide ) to be sound, unless you want to edit your equation. Since this is a point of contention for many people ( what is a convenience and what is not ) I'm interested in your proof. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>con   ven   ience ( k   n-v  n'yns ) n. 1.

I have proved beyond reasonable doubt that genocide seeks to kill the inconvenient. Well and truly proven.<br><b> S2:10-  </b>No, you haven't proven anything. You've just repeated yourself. First, you need to prove your statement that " every case of genocide sees the victim as an inconvenience ". You need to include an accepted definition of convenience. If you cannot do this, then you must revise your statement : <br><b>S1:11-  </b>Some how my interpretation that all the victims are inconvenient, seems to fit better than your interpretation that they are convenient, which is what you are saying when you challenge my comment.<br><b> S2:11-  </b>Let's not get sidetracked. Asserting what I may or may not be saying by challenging your comment is not proof of your statement. I'm still waiting to hear how every instance of genocide was for convenience, especially abortion. Support your interpretation.

What is the acceptance of abortion doing to our societies? Judge Robert Bork calls the U.S. Supreme Court    s Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion, an attempt by liberal secular elites to impose their values on the rest of the nation ( see Bork, p. 174 ). He observes : " Abortion has coarsened us " and it reflects " the brutalization of our culture " ( ibid., p. 182 ). He states : " The systematic killing of unborn children in huge numbers is part of a general disregard for human life that has been growing for some time. Abortion    deepens and legitimates the nihilism [ disregard for traditional values ] that is spreading in our culture and finds killing for convenience acceptable " ( ibid, p. 192 ).

When called out on that, you claim that I will reject anything you have to say. If you post something to back up your logic, you might find me willing to change my mind.

You seem to be suffering greatly from attachment to one of the simplest of false logics. Commies wear red hats. John wears a red hat. John is a Commie. This is false logic. You miss the main identifier of genocide... it is an effort to WIPE OUT a group... not a vehicle to kill a selected few of a group. Roe vs. Wade merely gives people a legal way to abort... it does not compel abortion. Get some help in the logic department. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Legalising abortion became the systematic process that was vital in order to identify abortion as genocide, and it is the only method that can allow for the entire destruction of the unwanted unborn.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It is you that has misidentified abortion as genocide. It clearly does not fit the definition. ( You do realize that we use words AS THEY ARE DEFINED to produce meaningful sentences, don't you? ) What legalized abortion does is reduce the number of illegal and inherently dangerous ( often deadly ) abortions that will take place in the absense of legal means. Get used to it. Many people do not want to have children and they get ' stuck ' with one accidently. Your insistence that they should have known better has no bearing on the situation. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>LINK Read it, or better yet read the entire thread.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I did. You merely repeat the same invalid ' logic ' you have presented here. genocide = the systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial, political or cultural group. If the law included a method by which some appointed group would determine who gets abortions, you might have a point in that the system could be skewed to abort all blacks or all hispanics or all christians or all blondes. However, that is not the case. As I pointed out earlier, legalized abortion merely gives people the right to obtain abortions and reduces the number of illegal abortions that would occur were it not legal. It is not a deliberate and systematic destruction of any group. You can attach all the similarities you can conjure up in your attempt to equate the two. Each one of these similarities is simply another red hat that does NOT necessarily make John a Commie. You do remember that logical falacy, don't you? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Let's do this step by step. The law is systematic, right?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>... to which I might ask, " Which one? " There's no sense in playing sentence tag with you. Just lay out your entire argument in a string of sentences... using definitions printed in Webster's or equivalent English dictionary, not your personal interpretations of definitions. Write as if you are trying to convince the King by way of letter that arbortion = genocide and should be stopped. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>So you dispute law is systematic?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Apparently, you have difficulties understanding English. I said there will be no ' one-sentence-sparring '... and nothing that I have said justifies your conclusion that I might dispute your initial, rhetorical question.

And that... is not a right, and is more like a legalized crime against nature. - Mosheh Thezion <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Mosheh did you not read anything on my previous posts on Abortion? I said under certain circumstances abortion should be considered. It is not as cut and dry as " Kill her baby " because of the development of the fetus. I said abortion is not a get out of jail free card, and the mother has her rights since she is the one responsible for the child she is carrying.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>ok... yes I read it. And yes the mother is responsible. so, why do we get upset when the mother dumps a new born in the trash? And yes, even i would agree, that under extreme cases, abortion may save the life of the mother. the problem is.. the set up... of making it available.. does not limit it to those mothers in danger. in fact.. they want to put planned parenthood in schools. do you support that? - Mosheh Thezion <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Mosheh your really trying to blur the issue here. The reason we look down upon throwing a child in the trash is because it is ALREADY BORN. It is not a fetus, and is past the third trimester, therefore it is a living breathing person. And Mosheh like I said earlier those considering an abortion must do so with extreme caution and clear thinking. Also Mosheh I have not heard on them putting a non profit organization in a school? What will they do there? Provide on campus aborting? Please... If anything they will provide sex education on practicing safe sex, abstinence, STD " s, and AIDS education. Something that under the Bush years was neglected and has seen teen pregnancy DOUBLE in eight years..<br><b> S2:3-  </b>it is not well covered by liberal media. Yes.. planned parenthood in school.. will do all those things.. and with it.. will offer easy access to off campus abortions. and so... let me ask you... a child maybe born via c-section... long before natural birth. I.e.. a child can be born early.. by c-section. so... if that child is viable... via c-section, it must be considered independant. And so... even though it is still in the womb, it is still viable, even though you claim it is a fetus... do you see... octomom.. had all her kids early.. premies... by your definition... everyone one of her 8 kids.. could of been killed, because they had not yet been naturally born. but.. they were viable... and are alive today. do you see.... just because the baby is still in the womb, does not change the fact that it is a viable baby. I say all abortions after 3 months, should be outlawed., and all abortions regardless should cause a man to do jail time. what say you? - Mosheh Thezion <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I say your measures are extreme and only show certain cases of extremity. There are enough laws on the books for regulating abortions. However, I do think that as in all subjects especially ones regarding sex or pregnancy or the like, need to be educated upon in a non biased factual manner. Free from bias of any kind.

You determine this by taking a biology class Yeah, I'd say it implies more of a full development than " mental existence ". No we are not weighing that... I made the question not you. We are weighing the moral value of a human over a cat. What makes the human have more value than a cat.... what about a monkey that has more " intelligence " than some humans? You seem to just not want to answer!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What the heck is " certain definition "? Do you agree or disagree that the definition I quoted implies a mental existence? Oh? Are you trying to tell me that the dictionary definition cannot tell us what it is to be human?! You can't be serious! The dictionary definition knows all and tells all! You must be wrong. So what is the criteria, then? What makes us ' a human ' as opposed to ' human '. Oh, so only fully developed... things... are human if they fit that criteria? What are they before they are fully developed? This question is off-topic, then. Make a new thread about what makes humans of more moral worth than animals to various posters. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Disagree. I stated that. The " certain definition " was the one you quoted. Are you suggesting the dictionary is meaningless? If you want to try and define every word in every definition then you could come to the conclusion that nothing is defined. You asked questions that were not related to definition as it assumes some level of knowledge ( ie not questioning every word in the definition ). The criteria for the word human is set up in the dictionary as that is what they are there for. I don't claim you have to put any moral significance on this. I said the definition you selectivily chose implies a fully developed body. This contradicts the other 5 definitions in the same link you gave me so I reject the definition you gave. It beats me what dictionary.com ( the source of that definition ) thinks 2 yr olds are. It is right on topic. Why can't you answer? The discussion we were having was about consciousness and that being the deciding factor for moral value. I said that my cat has consciousness and then you said my cat was not human. My question is why should " human " matter?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I see. On what basis do you disagree that dependence upon language and the creation and utilization of complex tools implies a mental existence? I see. You are then claiming the dictionary does not provide a criteria for being human, and instead assumes we know this criteria? What is the criteria then, according to Steve? Contradicts in what way? I see no contradiction. The other definitions provide no criteria, while the one I quoted did. Yet it is unacceptable to you for some reason you have not supplied. The deciding factor for moral value... in humans. Whether it applies to non-human animals or not would be the subject for another thread. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>That is more developmental than mental existence. You could certainly have mental existence and not have language or utilization of complex tools. Actually I am claiming the dictionary defines human. How scientific classification works is not the purpose of the dictionary. Seems you are claiming the dictionary can't tell us anything. I don't even know what you are typing to me! Well, ignoring the fact that you chose " homo sapiens " as opposed to one homo sapien ( a group instead of individual ) the other 4 or 5 definitions provide a definition. You seem to want the dictionary to be more than it is... I can't help you there. The only point I make is that a human embryo qualifies under the definition of human or human being. Obviously those two nouns describe something and an embryo is part of what they describe. So you don't want to answer or what? I made the question... you refuse to answer eventhough I have answered all your questions. Very classy.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes. Scientific classification is not the purpose of the dictionary. The dictionary's sole purpose is recording how people generally use terms. It has no objective validity and no use beyond informing us how people generally use terms. The only way this has any validity in this debate is if the question is : " What is the dictionary definition ". The dictionary has no use in this debate beyond that. That is not the question here. The question here is : " Does the fetus qualify conceptually under the philosophical umbrella of ' human being ' or ' person '? " That is a question the dictionary can never answer. I've never considered it important to this debate. If you wish to discuss this, I'd be happy to contribute in a new thread. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>and no one claimed otherwise. That is not the question. Philosophy doesn't define terms. The questions is " Does the fetus qualify as morally valuable ". The fact that the fetus is a human is rather irrelevant but don't go around saying " it isn't a human therefore ok " because 1 ) it in fact is a human and 2 ) this doesn't prove or disprove anything. I feel it is very important as I don't say which characteristics are important to give it moral value I just say being a human gives you moral value in and of its self. I'll consider starting a new thread since you feel it is irrelevant to this one ( although I disagree with this )<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Then you really cannot claim the dictionary tells us who is or is not human, because the dictionary does not determine ones species. If you wish to claim the dictionary can tell us the criteria for being human then you would have to tell me on what basis you contend that dependence upon language and the creation and utilization of complex tools does not imply a mental existence. We define terms for use in philosophy. And that is indeed the question since it is assumed that those who qualify as a ' person ' or ' human being ' is worthy of moral consideration. But is is philosophically human? What does it mean to be human? That is a question the dictionary cannot answer. Hell, the dictionary cannot even tell us whether it is scientifically human. Your original statement was that mental existence made your cat human. Mental existence may give your cat moral value, but it cannot make it human. However, we are only discussing the moral value in humans. Your point here is off-topic. I cannot see any point in this one.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-2253_190_186__198_201_202_207_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Jessica, http://prolifeamerica.com/4D-Ultrasound-pictures/<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Wow.

This means of course that this man http://phreeque.tripod.com/joseph_merrick.html was not a person, a woman with external physical deformities is not person, a severe burns victims is not a person and so on. It of course also means that by * your argument* a fertilised egg is not a person because it sure as heck doesn't look like one. Yes, how DARE I expect people to use unbiased material in a debate! I have no problem with you using biased sites if it is linked back to an original ubiased source - which this is not. It doesn't even say if these photos are gestational or pregnancy age and indeed most photos are unlabelled and some are clearly mislabelled, it misrepresents movements ( implying they are controlled and more than reflexes ), most of the photos are later on in the pregnancy when 90% of abortions take place in the first trimester etc etc etc. It is full of the usual pro-life lies and misrepresentations that I have sadly come to expect from pro-life sites. Please don't insult both of us by using such unreliable propoganda sites. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>My argument is not " It looks like a person, so it is a person. " It is more like it usually is a person when it looks like a person. I ask you what it is if it isn't a person. For me to say that the pictures supplied are persons does nothing to disparage a person whose physical or mental characteristics are not perfect. I do not advocate aborting those who may be deformed or retarded in growth or mental development. I believe they are persons too. You likened my presentation of babies in the womb to imaginary chimpanzees. I asked if I showed you a human being in the womb if you would believe one was in there. And I have done that.

These pictures are not labelled properly, are misleading and the site is ridden with lies. I'm not doubting the truth of 4D ultrasound pictures, I'm doubting the lying labels the AntiAbortionPropogandaIndustry ( AAPI ) put beside them. I know you want to believe all the lies these sites spew out Max, but you can't - they are unreliable, and you shouldn't trust anything they say.

This looks exactly like a person, therefore probably is a person. It's clearly your skills that are lacking Max. Would you like to admit the pictures are nonsense so we can move on? Such as some of the trisomy conditions for example. There, much better. Not quite medical sites, but a great improvement. Ahhh, you think sentience is important - you KNOW zefs don't have this in the time frame abortion is legal, right? and no pl " evidence " here about brainwaves etc please because I will laugh at you, although in a kind and gentle manner.

With Bell then telephone is a different matter. You are right to say you can't judge a person based on other actions but you can certainly judge related actions... Sanger was for eugenics which puts her motives in morals into question. I still maintain she has a complete consistent pro-choice stance.... so I don't know why you don't embrace her beliefs.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Because you don't get to define someone else's beliefs. I know it would be convenient for you to believe that those who are pro-choice also support eugenics for then it would be easier to smear. But the fact remains that despite her wrong and misguided views on eugenics - she was RIGHT about reproductive rights, birth control, family planning and women's health. I certainly don't want a return to my grandmother's world - 11 kids in a one room shack to an abusive husband who wouldn't work with no access to birth control or the possibility of telling him no. Sanger did a GREAT thing. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I was just saying it was a consistent argument. Is this the " even a broken clock is right twice a day " argument? she ended having 11 kids in a one room shack with an abusive husband who wouldn't work? I don't think so. once again, her moral values bring her other moral judgments into question.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>One does not have to belive B to belive A. You make that claim every time you say that not all lifers are religious. No. When it came to women having access to birth control, decent reproductive health care and the option not having children at all - she was 100% correct. Pardon me? Are you calling me a liar? Jim, John, Mike, Tom, Dan, Pat, Pris, Linda, Carol, Tess, and Nan ( MY MOM ). They lived in a one room shack in Duluth, MN and my grandpa was a crazy, abusive schmuck who would not work. Every time my grandmother tried to get birth control she was refused and spousal rape did not exist ( still doesn't in some states ). Hell, my mom couldn't get her tubes tied without my dad's permission, which he would not grant until my mom's doctor lied to him about my mom's ability to maintain another pregnancy. This was in the 1970 s. This same man who was granted control of my mother's reproductive rights walked out on the three kids he had with her ten years later. But not the fact that how she revolutionized womens health was a good thing. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Try but if the logic A is the same for B then naturally you would come to the same conclusion for A and B. My point is that she had a consistent belief. There are many reasons for pro-choice but logic presented by Simone at the time led me to believe she would have to have the same conclusion. ok? I certainly wouldn't call her a noble person. No, i'm not calling you a liar... I'm saying you are wrong. I don't think Sanger helped with those things you spoke of. Her theory behind is what I have a problem with.... of course her line of thinking would lead to things like eugenics and abortion.... it is the only consistent conclusion she could come to!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well you are wrong as neither Simone or myself believe in eugenics. I didn't know her. But she did a good thing. Are you nuts? You don't think helping ensure that women have access to health care, birth control and the right to decide for themselves impacted the fact that my grandmother couldn't get birth control without a man's permission, my mother could not get her tubes tied without a man's permission yet I can and have done both. Steve - despite what you think you are dead wrong. She started a health and social revolution that in this day and age has allowed me, a woman, to make decisions about motherhood MYSELF. That's huge. There are reasons for abortion beyone eugenics. Did you read what I wrote about my grandmother and mother? There is nothing wrong with motherhood. If one chooses to be a mother. There was a time where it was not a choice. Especially for married women. At least it wasn't their choice. Womens lives have worth regarldess of whether or not they are mothers. They always did. It has just taken some time to convince some men of that. In parts of this world ( including the Vatican ) we have yet to do so. Their lives have worth period. Ones life is even more precious when in control of it.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3580_207_205__208_210_211_212_213_214_215_216_223_5<br><b>S1:1-  </b>It goes without saying that abortion is more than just the simple withholding of one's support from the developing fetus ; it is the active removal of the fetus from it's natural environment using a procedure intended to bring about it's death. Why can we perform a certain action ( i.e. termination of life ) on a fetus, but not on a birthed child? If she has the right to remove her support from the child at any stage, then she has the right to withold nutrition and hydration from her 1 week old baby. If you are in support of the mother having the right to remove her support from the child at any stage, then you wouldn't mind if she starved her child to death, correct?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>True, no point in forcing the child to endure a long lingering death once it is removed from the mother's body. Personally I think it would be wonderful if we were able to simply remove the fetus from the mother's body and put it in an artificial womb until it could survive on its own. But if the fetus cannot survive being removed from its mother's body, quick disposal seems to be the next best option. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You know, newborn babies can't survive without the aid of another agent. If such an agent can't be found who will volunteer to care for the child, there is no point in forcing the child to endure a long lingering death. If the child can't survive without the aid of another agent, quick disposal seems to be the next best option, right?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Without the possibility of the child receiving aid from anyone, then it seems preferable to euthanize the child rather than let it starve to death, yes. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It seems more preferable to me to force someone to care for the child than to euthanize it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Oh, why? Moreover, what kind of force is permissable? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Because it is reasonable to ask / force somone to care for a child when you would rather see it euthanized. Moreover, the kind of force that is permissable is the same kind that removes my tax dollars from me in order to fund a welfare system ; or that removes my tax dollars from me in order to support pro-abortion organizations.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I don't quite follow you here. Could you rephrase or explain this? So the threat of imprisonment? Considering the number of people who don't report all of their owed taxes, that seems like a pretty weak threat to me. Besides, I don't pay taxes because someone forces me to but because I want to contribute to the Canadian gov't. :) <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Because [ I think ] it is reasonable to ask / force someone to care for a child [ in cases where Nurglitch ] would rather see it euthanized. I don't understand your point here. And even if you didn't want to contribute to the Canadian government, you could still be forced to do so :p.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Ah, okay. My question still stands then. Why do you think it is reasonable to force someone to care for a child when no one is willing to? My point is that the mere threat of imprisonment seems pretty weak in a situation where you have to force someone to look after a child. Despite laws against child neglect, children are still neglected. Also, it seems to me that the situation has to be pretty harsh before you run out of people willing and able to look after an additional child. I take it you've never studied Canadian tax law then. If you're unwillingly paying taxes to the Canadian gov't, then you either need a new accountant or need to study up on the law. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I think it is reasonable to ask someone to give up one cup of coffee, gourmet dinner, ice cream cone etc. a month ( in order to pay a tax, for example ) in order to preserve the life of the child. I attribute inherent dignity to the human person, and thus when one person's right to life conflicts with another persons quality of life, I think that quality of life must win. Despite laws against murder, people still murder. This stops no one from making laws against murder. Please explain...</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3580_134_133__136_138_141_142_143_146_147_149_150_154_155_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>its a baby, a human, a life. it doesnt matter what its called, the sentiment remains the same. most women have abortions because they dont want to have a baby. they have sex and dont want to get pregnant, but end up getting pregnant anyway. so they abort the baby. the result is the same as if they had sex and didnt get pregnant. abortion is like an " undo " button. people make mistakes, people do dumb stuff. i dont think there is a single woman in the world that enjoys having abortions. like i said before, abortions are not fun events. they are not pleasureable and they are not something to look forward to. but if youre having sex for pleasure, and you dont want to get prengant, you use contraceptives. if you dont use contraceptives and get pregnant, you have an abortion at the end of the day the result is identical : a night of pleasureable sex, no pregnancy. what is the difference?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>One you murder one you dont.... this is pretty obvious. How would you feel if we thought you were a mistake and wished to hit the " undo " button. You are ok with us just takin you out? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>if it was me i would have no opinion or feeling about it. how would you feel if you were never were even concieved because the condom cut you off before you even had a chance to be a mistake?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If you killed someone sleeping they would never know either, unkerpaulie, however I wouldn't call this ok. I would feel betrayed. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>therefore, there is essentially no effective difference between abortion and contraception when it comes to preventing people from being born. 2 differnt methods of achieving the same results<br><b> S2:3-  </b>except one is killing someone... like i said. Unless you are ok with killing people then you really make no sense <br><b>S1:4-  </b>i guess you are ok with preventing people from ever having life at all<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Like VOR said.... conception would be when they are a person whether you look at DNA or just common sense. Even if you wanna do the " lookign test " at a few weeks it looks like a very small human... very small. So what is your point exactly? ( and I don't mean to be sounding like a jerk I just wanna know what your point is ) <br><b>S1:5-  </b>i think the point is that the line between getting accidentally pregnant and not getting accidentally pregnant is very thin. the root of the problem is not freedom and rights as much as it is having sex with little discretion. if a person has sex and doesnt get pregnant, they are doing the exact same thing as the pers on that has sex and does become pregnant. when you have sex and you dont want to become pregnant, you wear contraceptive, or what ever type of birth control you can. sometimes the birth control method fails, and you accidentally become pregnant anyway. the original intention was to have sex and not get pregnant. in such a case, abortion fixes the situation where the birth control method failed. is the problem really abortion? would you rather every unintentional pregnancy to produce another unwanted baby? ( 40,000,000 since 1972? ) would you prefer a more effective form of birth control that could allow sex without accidental pregnancies more often? the only way to reduce the number of abortions is to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies. either more birth control, or less sex, neither of which are viable solutions. so what do you suggest?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I suggest banning abortion as that would cut down the number. If someone has sex with protection they still are accepting all risks involved in this like like you accept all consequences of any action you do. For example, when you cross the street you accept the consequence that you might get hit by a car. This doesn't mean it is ok to get hit by a car or you wanted to get hit by a car, but that you knew the possibility was out there. If you cross the street you have accepted this. Now when you have sex it is the same thing. You realize that you might get pregnant. You accept this. Once you get pregnant you have created a life and have no right to end it even if you didn't want it because you accepted that risk. I don't suppose you are for murdering people are you? Your suggestions are that you fix a problem by murder. Well, does this mean I can kill everyone in my way to " fix " my problems? You then ask would I rather have 40 mill more people here. yes I would. If you value human life then you wouldn't want to kill people like that. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>interesting, because in america if you choke on a chicken bone at kfc and suffer injuries, you can sue kfc, even though you knew there is a risk of choking on a chicken bone whenever you eat chicken. should we also ban law suits so that those risk-taking chicken-eaters should also face the consequences of their actions?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>First off, you can sue for anything. If you choke on a chicken bone you won't win unless KFC told you it was boneless. You CAN'T sue a condom company ( as in being able to win ) if you get pregnant because the label clearly says it is not 100% effective. You are back in Tort law again. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>yes but there are no disclaimers on drumsticks that eating this run you the risk of choking. yes disclaimers protect the companies certain liabilities, but even when consumers are informed of a risk, they still can get recourse if they suffer because of it anyway, yes sex can get you pregnant. thats a risk everybody that has sex takes. still, pregnancy is not what the couple wanted when they had sex. so they have the option of undoing the pregnancy via abortion its like a manufacturing company that makes teddy bears, and unexpectedly produces a stuffed rat instead. that company has the option of getting rid of the unwanted rat, rather than being forced to package and sell it as a teddy bear. yes, the risk of accidentally manufacturing something thats not a teddy bear exists, but why should the company continue to produce these unwanted rats?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-2554_8_5__13_17_18_29_42_43_44_48_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Hmm... funny, I don't remember ever hearing a pro-lifer say that pregnancy was a wonderful snuggly thing or the best thing in the world. What I do see is pro-lifers like myself wondering why pregnancy is protrayed ( in the form of a generalization ) as so horrible by people such as yourself who just described it as " unbelievably " hard to go through, or a " life threatening condition " like malignant cancer. You didn't qualify it by saying " some " pregnancies are life threatening or unbearable. Maybe yours was, but how can you say that for every woman in the world? I know for a fact that my wife's pregnancy was not " unbelievably hard to go through " -- she's told me otherwise and I believe her. Sorry, but I believe my wife over you. :) What you did was use unfounded generalizations, which is exactly the sort of thing this thread is about.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I'm sorry, this is pretty damn funny, coming from a pro-life person :p You said the opportunity was wonderful. How can you say that for every woman in the world? If they do not want that opportunity, it is not wonderful for her. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>A healthy baby being born is always a wonderful thing, as long as mother is safe too. :)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Jyoshu, The ' opportunity ' to bring a child into the world is not always wonderful for every women. You cannot speak for every woman and you should not be able to decide for every woman. JPSartre 12, Pregnancy is always a physical detriment to the woman's body. That it is survivable ( most of the time in this day and age ) does not change that fact. Sometimes it is a larger risk, sometimes a smaller, but it is always a physical detriment. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Sure, in the same sense of walking along the sidewalk with the risk of a car jumping the curb, in this day and time anyway... It's NOT the 19th century, in fact.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>And if you don't want the risk, should you be relegated to never walking on the sidewalk, ever? And if you get hit by that car, should you not be allowed medical care if you do not want to live with the consequence? You seem to have no trouble forcing that risk upon women when they do not wish to take that risk. Unless you can take the fetus out of her, pregnancy is a physical detriment to her body. Actually, we can speak for every pregnancy in terms of how it affects the body. Neither you nor I can speak for how the pregnancy is percieved by the woman. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>But at least I'm not willing to have the car occupant killed to avoid that risk.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Would you object to my right to kill the driver if he was driving right toward me and there was no other way to avoid my fate? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I've already answered the question by saying that I think abortions when the mother's life is at risk should be allowable.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Oh? But you said this : I guess this means that you would be willing to kill the car occupant to avoid the risk :) However, lets say that we don't know how badly the car will hurt you, much like in pregnancy we have no way of knowing how much it will harm the woman.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-6122_56_54__65_67_72_73_6<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Jyoshu and Steeeeeeve, you really haven't answered my question : How would you like to die in the same way as Prudence died? Would you enjoy dying in that manner? Would you consider your death to be just a necessary step in making sure that all abortions are stopped? Would you relish your martyrdom?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I wouldn't want to die in ANY manner. But what does this have to do with abortion? The reason I didn't reply ( and probably the same with Steeeeve ) is that the article is not even about abortion. There's no evidence in the article that Prudence even wanted an abortion, or that if she had, that she wouldn't have been allowed to get one. It mentions the family not having the money to pay for the removal of a dead fetus, but that's not the abortion issue. It seems to me that the problem here is mainly the fact that overall medical care in 3rd world countries is generally pretty bad compared to the U.S. and other more developed nations. So on that, of course I agree with you that it would be better if they had better overall medical care and didn't use midwives. Why on earth would I not agree with you here??? This has nothing to do with a woman choosing to kill her living unborn baby. We have no idea if this woman wanted an abortion. Furthermore, it seems the topic of the article is more about the inequality between men and women in the African country where it took place, rather than about abortion specifically. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Prudence's death is directly related to the abortion issue because Bush has drastically cut U.S. funding for international maternal healthcare, using the excuse that he might be paying for abortions. The Roman Catholic Church, for example, seems to have a hissyfity every time the term " reproductive healthcare " is mentioned. Prudence died because women are still considered dirt throughout the world, most especially by religions and rightwing Republican terrorists.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That's quite a stretch! Your problem should be with Bush, not with pro-lifers ; I'd have no problem with Bush earmarking more money for women's health. If that's the only link you can find between the story you posted and the abortion issue, then I'd have to assume that if Bush earmaked the money again but somehow made sure it was for women's healthcare for everything except abortion, that would be ok with you, since the article didn't involve abortion in any way. If woman are considered " dirt ", that's still a separate issue from whether or not abortion is the right thing to do. It's fallacious to try and associate the pro-life stance with things like this -- no pro-lifer I've ever known of would want this to happen to anyone. The fact remains you used a story that has nothing to do with abortion in a debate about abortion. There is no reason to assume what happened to Prudence would not have still taken place regardless of whether or not abortion was legal. If your point was simply that women should receive better healthcare, of course I'd agree. But then so would every pro-lifer I've ever known. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So-called " pro-life " when one woman a minute dies throughout the world because of pregnancy? When most of the anti-choice, anti-women, anti-life people are opposed to contraception and the idea of reproductive healthcare?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Wow, this is just simply not true. Simone, I'm not going to discuss this any further with you because you're just being reactionary and offering mostly rhetoric here. You're also using instances where women did not choose to abort but lost their baby anyway to argue for right to abortion, and it's just not any valid argument whatsoever.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-6122_103_98__105_106_110_113_116_117_118_119_120_121_122_123_124_125_126_4<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I actually said you were being one... and you were ;) Even I have my limits before I just have to call you out on it... you just start with insults.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Oooh.

No insults and topical, but neither you nor Jyoshu are interested. Post #91 in this thread. No insults, and admittedly not topical. Again, both of you ignore it. Post #83 in this thread. I return Jyoshu's insult volley, and the ONLY thing he concentrates on in that post is the insult. He drops the ENTIRE REST of the discussion. You two are incredibly transparent. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It is also amazing that you think I read every post.... none of those are addressed to me so why do you feel I am required to respond?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I never said anything about thinking you read every post... You respond to posts all the time where they aren't addressed to you... But it's interesting to note a trend whereby you jump ALL OVER the posts which you feel are insulting... You're more interested in debating what you think is " insulting " than you are in actually debating the topic... Seriously. You think that line is " mud throwing "??? Now that I'm refraining from using the " L " word, you REALLY have to reach to claim I'm insulting, don't you... < yawn > Jyoshu, despite what you may want to claim, that's just blatantly false. On the flip side, I think " Shooterandproud " is doing something similar from when I came to the message boards. He's seeing the back and forth, and noting a trend in the postings of you and Steeeeve... Claim what you want. Your continued practices give you away... I would ask the same. And just out of curiousity Jyoshu, in all the people that have " watched ", has anybody but your fellow " ally of views " come out with the same perspective as you proclaim??? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Yes, it is mud throwing. There was no need for that line but you put it in there for the sole purpose of either 1 ) trying to discredit me or 2 ) insult or put-down me. Are you changing definitions yet again?

The only reason I continue posting is for the enjoyment of watching you continue to contradict yourself. like... matthew S and Kronus? Very subjective as well.

Maybe it should be written into the job description? I always thought the the job of the President was to run the US, not the WHO, Red Cross, UNICEF, etc.,<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Of course he isn't responsible - but if you are gonna offer to help - then help. He just dangled help in way to appease the religious right here in the US. It was reprehensible that he used the possibility of helping people in ecomonically impovershed situation as a political pandering tool. Bush is a big dinkie you know... for ooodles of reasons. Problem is that Washington is filled with dinkies of various sizes. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>What?! You don't like that Bush took a page out of the DNC's playbook? :) I guess it's better to be a BIG dinkie than a small dinkie, right?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If you are trying to hurt my feelings you are gonna have to do something besides insult democrats.

Why am I not surprised? ;) I'll admit to the former if you'll admit to the latter. :)<br><b> S2:3-  </b>If a Democrat dangled help above the heads of someone who needs it with no real intention of helping and just play nice to their buddies it would tick me off as well. For starters this Foley thing - the way dems are using it has me way unimpressed. In this regard we are the same. Men and their wishful thinking. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Democrats wave money above the heads of minorities, Seniors and anybody else that they think can get them elected. It has been that way since LBJ. Where have you been? And as soon as Republicans try to reign in the wild Democratic spending, they're accused of trying to starve Seniors and children. Unfortunately, the Republicans in power now have learned from the Democrats and are waving money over the heads of Seniors ( prescription plan ) and playing to children ( No Child Left Behind ). Finally, a bridge between us. Did I ever tell you what my knickname was? It's Tripod.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Yah - but they actually intended to help. It didn't come with any strings outside of the " vote for me and this is what iI will try to do " bit that all candidates have. The difference in this situation is that help was denied to organizations abroad to appease the religious right here. Help came with an agenda, with strings, that had nothing to do with the people needing the help. It's one thing to have denied it because we could not afford it, or some other reason - yucky that these people's needs no longer mattered just so Bush could appease his buddies. I make no such accusation nor do I mind how much I am taxed but would certainly like to see my tax dollars spent better. I don't know enough about the drug program to have an opinion there. " No Child Left Behind " seems to be a cheap way to pass the buck. On a side note, I hate voucher programs. We need to step up and address whatever it takes to make all schools good. Offering some kids in bad schools the opportunity to go to a better one is a complete cop-out. Probably more than we would admit - we just tend to tackle divisive topics on this forum. I will refrain from requesting the story behind that one. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Tell me what foreign aid doesn't come with strings? We gave North Korea 100 k barrels of oil per year, $5 Billion in aid and light water nuclear reactor technology under Clinton in 1994, not out of altruism because millions of NKs were starving, but because Kim promised not to continue working on nukes. ALL of our foreignaid comes with strings, as it should. You object because you just don't like it when those strings are moral ones. I've always been puzzled why liberals, other than unionized teachers, are opposed to giving parents a choice of where to send their kids to school. Would you force all fast food eaters to only go to McDonald's or do you save your restrictions only for poor children living in ghettos? It gets old if we all sit around singing Kumbya, doesn't it. :) Smart move.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>What a big liar head he turned out to be. Definately a shady move, not sure how I feel abut that - but with an ulterior motive that makes some sense. An attempt at keeping things globally safer. Damn right I don't like it. When is the right going stop playing the morality police? They have no damned business doing it. Not that I find cutting off medical care for pregnant women, children and women in general just so the religious right can feel warm and fuzzy in church on Sunday and so Bush can garner a few more votes moral. More children and babies will die without medical care than will ever die due to abortion in these areas. I am not opposed to letting parents choose. I am opposed to offering choices to some in lieau of fixing problem schools. ] <br><b>S1:6-  </b>he knew that NK was cheating on the agreement, but went about his business as if they were in compliance. All the while, NK moved closer to having a workable bomb. Do you think that his " out of sight, out of mind " attitude really made us safer? How about this : Should the US give money to organizations that practice forced abortions and sterilizations? I'm guessing that you're in favor of giving them the money. After all, we wouldn't want US morality to get in the way now, would we? So, while a failing school district flounders, you would force kids to go down with the sinking ship. How principled of you.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Probably not. Don't know enough details for further commentary here. But for the record - I don't think Bush's cowboy antics have made us any safer either. Quite the opposite actually. Of course I don't condone forced abortions. I am pro-CHOICE, remember? But I think China is pretty unique in this. What about other places? No you do - because that floundering school district will continue to have students that get ignored. Sure the lady in the apartment behind has the option of sending her kid to a better district, 15 miles away in the burbs - but if she is working a low paying job and using public transport how likely is that really? Vouchers help limited few and gets government out of actually working on the real problems. I guess it wouldn't bother me much if I didn't feel that some seem to think that vouchers are the answer. They are not - they are a bandaid and a cop-out. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>That's a fair statement. I'm not sure that we are, either. I do know that we are, at least, more aware that Islamofascism is spreading around the globe. Which places would those be? The ones that practice forced female castration? You can't make blanket condemnations and then backpedal when I show you legitimate reasons for defunding them. No, they're a threat to the status quo of teacher unions and bad schools with ZERO accountability. In Michigan, we have school of choice in some areas. You'd be amazed at how fast a poorly performing school district starts to institute changes when it sees over $8000 / student going elsewhere.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3454_38_6__40_44_45_46_48_56_57_59_66_67_73_74_75_76_77_82_83_84_87_93_99_100_101_102_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I agree... and there is lots of life sitting in state homes waiting for that hope!

All sensible pro life believe that........ <br><b>S1:10-  </b>Uh? Ok Yes I asked about taking care of the unwanted children alive now first... that would of course include " children aready born "!! Where did this law breaking stuff come from / What are you talking about?<br><b> S2:10-  </b>If people at abortion murder clinics break the law in their protesting they should be arrested and prosecuted...........

It works both ways........... <br><b>S1:11-  </b>Well well we have found somthing we can agree on! People breaking the law at abortion clinics or anywhere else should be arrested. You may be suprised to learn I myself think flag burning is a simple waste of time. That said I still am not ready to arrest sombody for it. I don't think its a good way to exercise ones first amendment rights. It does not bother me that it works both ways!<br><b> S2:11-  </b>Well Johnson since I have seen men fight and die for that flag I have to part company with you on this one............. I would see the a constitutional amendement banning the buring of the American Flag and to see left wing whackos burning it at demonstrations against the war in Iraq and our brave troops fighting there really saddens me.......... <br><b>S1:12-  </b>I think we parted way befor this. And you should not assume I dislike flag burning any more or less than you. I too have lost friends and famly members to not this war but others. By the way I'm not a left wing whacko... I'm also not a right wing whacko...<br><b> S2:12-  </b>I am sorry you feel that way........ It doesn ; t matter though...... I don't assume anything...... Don't be so defensive and sensitive.....

The difference between you and me is you think that all 40,000,000 abortions since 1972 were necessary and you could care less about the innocent baby in the womb............... I care for both the mother and the baby in the womb and I think that about 90 percent of them could have been avoided..........

It will be like prohibition all over, again. Then abortion won't matter to you, even though it is being done by those who haven't practiced medicine, or those who lost their licenses. Sadly then, women will definitely die. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Yeah that is one baby, I just widh you felt the same way about all babies that were being aborted............<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I guess you are the only person who feels like you can control the many women in the world.

Who created that right that exists because the body politic admits that right? As for the 4th amendment, I didn't see anything that says personal autonomy there. In fact, I don't recall the framers ever thinking it would mean that. It clearly talks about unreasonable search and seisure and that is all. It doesn't say " you can do whatever you want with your own body "... it says " someone can't go through all your stuff, search you, without a warrant or probable cause ".. maybe it is in the fine print. You might end up saying something like " well the fetus is seizing something from the person "... to which I reply " that is not unreasonable and it says search and seisure... not or " as he / she was forced to be created there by a willing act of someone and now it is the only place he / she can survive. gotta go to work.. will reply to the rest later<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Who created it is beside the point. You might find this link helps to explain things : http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-rights/ <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It does if you wish to prove the right exists beyond government. Otherwise if the government got rid of the " rigth " then you could have no objection what so ever to it because they aren't denying you a right because it doesn't exist. In fact, we would never " create " new rights ( think back to the days of slavery ) because one could not claim a right that doesn't exist. So if you say the right still exists beyond government then you would need to show where it came from.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I thought that it was obvious that rights are prior to government and are assumed by a body politic, the society and culture that creates the space in which a government apparatus may be erected. And I keep pointing out that this right is a necessary component of any rights-based system such that anyone who agrees that there are rights must agree that there is a right to personal autonomy. Yeah, I answered that one in my discussion with Chloe ( post #128 ), pointing out that life is incidental to personal autonomy. I think I also talked about that in this thread as well. I really suggest you read the link on legal rights so that I don't have to waste my time giving a lecture on how rights work. Thanks. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Why? The US has no right to personal autonomy. I see no law that says this. Search and Seizure doesn't work as that is not personal autonomy. That is having the right for someone ELSE to not search you. Nothing about you being able to do what you want to do to yourself. Yeah read it. IT makes no sense as a right to life is essential for any other right. Then don't respond... and I did read it by the way.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>As I read the passage : So you wouldn't call being required to host an unwanted fetus as an unreasonable seizure of their person? Security of persons against unreasonable search and seizure seems to me to constitute the very essence of a right to personal autonomy - the gov't doesn't get to dispose of your body or possessions without your permission. It can't sell you into slavery, for example. You may want to re-read it because I explain how a right to life is incidental or derivative of more essential rights, and how it is necessarily trumped by these rights, including the right to personal autonomy. Here's the gist, so you know what to read for : A right to personal autonomy is necessary as a structural component of a system of rights, because it defines how ownership is resolved in a system of rights. The possession and exercise of these rights are incidental to the possession of life. Any right to life is therefore either derivative of these foundational rights, or participates in an incoherent system of rights. Either way, a right to life is trumped by a right to personal autonomy. I'm sorry, it's just that you don't seem to be responding as though you read and understood the material. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Wow, I called that one... remember when I said this... And yes the gov't does dispose of your body without your permission... see abortion. We might even be able to extend this farther... the 14th amendment ( which would superceed any previous one ) says you have the right to life that can't be taken away without due process of the law. So in a sense, we can't even kill the baby without due process right?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10856_52_14__55_56_57_60_62_70_73_75_77_81_85_87_4<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Why shouldn't a women be forced to see the image before getting a legal elective procedure? How would like to be required to submit to a prostate exam and provide a semen sample before you could buy condoms?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Contraception and terminations are two completely different procedures with two completely different outcomes. Are the use of prophylactics the same procedure or even directly related to medical procedures to treat sexually transmitted diseases? You need to try harder than than Even if it was a requirement to provide a sperm sample and submit to a prostate examination before I could but condoms I would still have a choice ( unlike your child ) I would not be forced to do anything and it cetainly would not be tantamount to rape If after buying condoms a finger was forcibly thrust into my rectum and after that I was locked in a room with a dirty mag and told not to come out without a sperm sample then I could say that I was forced to do these things. That is why I object to the word force as well as the word rape.. both are incorrect and dishonest. They suggest coercion and helplessness when none exist ( except in your case ). I am not forced to provide money in order to purchase goods it is a requirement. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Contraception is morally repugnant to some religious folks just as abortion.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So is eating pork apparently... beef to some. So what? What does religion have to do with the conversation between you and I? I never raised it and you dont believe in it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Religion as everything to do with the law we are discussing.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It has nothing to do with the false accusations of rape and forced being injected into the proceedings. You may have religion on your mind regarding abortion and contraception but there are ethical and moral perspectives outside of religion that would require a woman to look at the potential child that she is about to destroy. Abortion is not just about relieving oneself of a parasite. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>" Potential child " is a meaningless term. What something may become is not what it is. Where outside of religion is a person composed of 2,4,8 cells? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_fallacy<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No its not a fetus is a potential child. It is a term that is just as meaningful as ' person ' I never said that an 8 celled fetus is a person... in fact I never said a fetus at any stage is a ' person '. Incidentally what ultrasound scanner can produce an image for a 2,4,8 celled fetus? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>No, it is not or else we wouldn't see a move in a number of states to make conception the point when one has rights.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>They may see it as a religious issue.. so what? We are not considering the religious issue of termination. That wasnt the OP. If the fetus was considered a person with rights the woman would not be allowed an abortion... period <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Who do you suppose is sponsoring the legislation? Since it isn't a person, why should a woman be " required " to see images of it before aborting? Why are her rights subordinated to this non-person?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>I dont care What rights? Her right to not see it? If we are to enter a brave new world of disposable fetuses then at least the woman should look at the thing before she destroys it. If only to remind her to take the pill or demand her boyfriend uses a rubber next time especially if the state is paying for it. Jeez that poor darling who would have to bear the agony of looking at an image of the ' parasite ' inside her would probably not baulk at looking inside her hanky before binning it ( and if it is a ' non person with no rights and a parasite to boot then whats the problem? ). If people are to indulge in the grown up world of sexual intercourse then they should face up to the consequences of feckless behaviour during it. People like you who demonise or present fetuses as parasites not worthy of a second look before crushing and binning are doing nothing for humanist morality. See no god <br><b>S1:7-  </b>No, her right not to be compelled to undergo an invasive and unnecessary medical procedure to satisfy someone else's agenda. Who are you to decide that? Because you know she's been careless. The State forcing her for no medical reason. Feckless? Is it the sex or your lack of getting your share that's bothering you? I've done no such thing. I simply wish to let the woman decide while it's early without coercion either way.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>Some say that abortion is an invasive and unnecessary medical procedure People should have the courage to look at the thing they want to destroy. Most incidence of sexual congress are mutually agreed and contraception is very reliable so the odds are that she was. Careless or not she should be a witness to what she wishes to destroy. There may be no ' medical ' reason to terminate the fetus I take it you have no argument so you chose to insult me instead While its early? So how would looking at an image of an ' early ' fetus coercion. You want the fetus to be seen as a liability, something of no importance because it suits your agenda of abortion on demand. It has nothing to do with womens rights, instead it has everything to do with the notion that the fetus should be given no rights. Thats why you insist that a deluded religious person can believe a fetus has any right to a second thought from either the mother or the State.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10872_19_18__20_21_22_23_24_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>My problem is with the pro choicers who see abortion as a solution rather than a failure.

Even when the pregnancy is the result of rape? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No So denying a potential child a chance to realise its potential is a OK? You think that a rape which results in a pregnancy that itself results in a potential child being destroyed does not indicate that somewhere along the line there was a failure? You think that aborting the fetus and throwing it away makes it ok? I doubt that the pregnant woman does and it certainly doesnt make it ok for the unborn child ( with or without an ' operational brain ' ).<br><b> S2:2-  </b>One cannot unfairly deny anything to a non-entity. " Its " implies possession. There is no one to possess. No one to deny that to which " they " have a right. I don't pretend to understand each individual situation. I can think of scenarios where an abortion would not be a " failure ". I'm not sure what you mean by " ok "? Part of the problem is that men like you have no problem speaking for women. And again, the " unborn " has no standing even though you'd like to give it a voice. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Part of the problem is that men like you see an unborn child as a problem when it suits you. A fetus it is always a victim when its aborted. People like you label the fetus as a nonentity and even a parasite to justify the act of destroying it You need to dehumanise the fetus and use emotional and extremely rare cases of pregnancy through rape to justify the act of abortion itself. The ' unborn ' does have a standing and there are people that believe quite rightly that it should have a voice and do even though you'd like them not to. People like you think that destroying an early fetus.. getting in quick before the fetus inevitably becomes sentient makes it ' ok ' ( oh I forgot you dont know what this means ) Whereas I cant see the act of destroying an unborn child ever being ok and can only been seen as a failure even if it is deemed the best decision out of number of bad ones.. Maybe you would think this as a success I never speak for women whereas you do. Your dishonesty is noted<br><b> S2:3-  </b>How any man sees it is of no consequence. Assumes facts not in evidence. Wrong. I cannot claim the fetus is something other than it is as a means to limit a woman's right to self-determination. Do not those sorts of cases need to be considered when making law? The point being that the individual circumstances that might lead to a woman's decision to abort are none of my, or your, business. What I like has nothing to do with it and " quite rightly " is merely your opinion. One not shared by a majority of women. Ok by whose standard and for whom was what I was getting at. The " best decision out of number of bad ones " is not my definition of a " failure ". How I think of it is of no consequence. You said, " You think that aborting the fetus and throwing it away makes it ok? I doubt that the pregnant woman does... " <br><b>S1:4-  </b>What? The fetus is the only one that is destroyed in an abortion. How the hell can that be an assumption? There is more than just the woman involved. You claim the fetus has no rights or status until YOU feel it should. You contradict yourself in the same post. First you want the extremes to be the default way to consider policy then you insist its only the womans decision and no ones elses anyway. Make your mind up. What ' you like ' has everything to do with your mere opinion too. The ' majority ' of women can share their opinion.. the destroyed fetus does not have that privilege. I dont agree that the majority of women would believe that a fetus has no standing and an abortion should be considered anything other than a failure... have you access to a poll that says otherwise? You want a standard to help you understand ' ok '? Jeez You dont see a bad decision as a failure? Jeez again So you dont think of it as a failure then say how you think of it is of no consequence? You are probably right then You think that saying ' I doubt that the pregnant woman does ' means that I am ' speaking for women '?

That is not the question however, nor is it the reason for Roe v Wade. The answer, whether we like it or not, is that abortion has existed for generations ; as far back as you'd like to go probably.

I have stated that the fetus should have at least some consideration. I, like Sinjin, believe that an early termination should be granted to a pregnant woman on demand. What I do not believe is that it should be seen as anything other than a failure, a failure of society to prevent this situation. I do not subscribe to the view that a fetus should be either dehumanised, considered a parasite or a manifestation of the rapists seed ( as the mad Simone seems to insist it is if it was a product of sexual assault ).<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I agree. char / 10 <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I cant decide whether Ive had an attack of the sensibles or Ive brought you two down to my level :p<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No, I've said I'm a centrist.

I have contributed to and benefitted from a national health service. I dont own a gun and dont want to. I have belonged to a trade union since I was a boy. I subscribe to European centre right politics. To most Americans I am a milksop lefty. I view the screaming reactionary left just as I view the screaming reactionary right... they both use accusation of stereotypes to conceal their lies.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Again, with respect to the looney left, I can't agree with you more. The one I learned in my thrity years in the Teamsters union, is that mixing politics and labor is a bad cocktail. The Teamsters never liked the idea, but as with most of the country's labor, sort of got forced into it, becasue while under fire from the Republicans, it was a way of getting our message heard. The Teamsters however, have never been a partisan group either. The socialist / anrchist / peace and social justice left have done just as much damage to this country in my view as the radical right. Every time I think of extremes in this country, I of images of the KKK, witch burnings, and women burning their bras : it's all silly and dangerous. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Our unions financed the Labour party and forced left wing policy on to them until the Conservative Thatcher government all but destroyed both the unions and Labour during the 1980 s. The influence that the trade union movement had on British politics ( both Labour and Conservative governments ) gave the Trotskyite and Workers revolutionary factions power far beyond what their low numbers should have done. The extreme political leanings of union officials ultimately made Britain a manufacturing basket case. While the Japanese exported good quality cars to us our cars manufacturers were striking over tea breaks and producing ' Friday afternoon ' lemons.. to name just one unionised industry. So I agree with you that politics and labour do not mix. Ive seen the best of union activity and maybe not the worst but some aspects of my own union that I am not proud of.. to say the least. America has more extremes and more extremists than the UK. IMO much of the dynamism of American thought and action comes from the lack of social care in US society.. plus ( believe it or not ) gun ownership. A society where there is no safety net must be more dynamic than a society built around one. However I have no valid opinion on how Americans should live their lives so I try to argue points that are relatively parallel with the UK.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-731_72_70__74_75_77_78_79_84_85_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>That fallacy again? The world was formed from the Solar Nebula around 4.5 billion years ago. The universe is around 8 to 9 billion years older than our solar system. Before that it is an unknown. As you would know if you'd bother to read what has been posted is that we've never said that it wasn't human. When I say potential I mean a potential human being, a person. That is the point. You believe that DNA is what makes us a human being. Transgenic animals prove you wrong.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>At risk of offending you, where did the nebula come from? ( and yes, I know you know what I am getting at. ) <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The remains of a previous star system. It is the ultimate recycling program. :) A star dies, the expelled material gradually condenses to a critical point and nuclear fusion occurs again. The planets are just left over debris which was far enough away not to get dragged back into the sun but was still able to form on its own. Did you know that Jupiter is a failed star? The Alpha Centari star system had been part of the same nebula as well as Tau Ceti and some other local star systems which gradually had drifted out of the stellar nursery, which had been the nebula to where they are now. One could say that this is how stars reproduce.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Interesting. But where did all this material come from Originally? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>As I had said, unknown. It could have always existed in a never ending cycle of expansion and contraction the same of with the stars, or not. Who created god? If god could have existed forever, then why not the universe? Or the Cosmos? One interesting idea is that since all of the stars systemd within a certain distance of us are all made from the same stellar material that if we ever do make it there and find life bearing worlds it stands a good chance that we'd also be genetically compatible as well.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Those are good questions. I am still pondering that one myself. However, I think it has something to do with the fact that God is sentient and the universe is not. There is a difference between a creator and what is created. My argument is not well thought out as of yet, so I will stop here. I will try to give better soon. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Some on here believe that the universe itself is god and that it is sentient as well and that we are just a tiny part of it. Some people don't like the idea of only being a part instead of being the whole.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I have been pondering this abit. Here is my thinking. The universe exists within a framework. Most folks would call that framework space-time. To be self existent, it would necessarily have to come from outside of the framework. There would have to be something that is outside of time for time to exist. We could call that eternity. No one might say that eternity is a framework and would require something outside of it to exist. That would not follow logically. Eternity by definition is frameless. Boundless. That concept leads to a definition of God. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>There is also the thought that our universe is part of a much bigger framework called the COSMOS where universes are born and die all of the time. Why would god even need to create anything when there is no perception of time for god? And why would god need us to believe in god as well? What would be the point?

Umm, yeah that    s what ALL is    so what? They offer post-abortion treatment centers too. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I'm not talking about what they look like. I'm talking about their cellular structure. That said, I've never heard of a disabled person born with a tail, or that in any way resembled a blastocyst ( not even the " Elephant man " did ). So you have no problem spreading lies to " innocent " people walking into abortion clinics? I know. Do you even read other people's posts?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Everyone has tails! So the only way the zygote is going to be human is if somebody BORN looks like it? So the only way a toddler is going to be human is if an ADULT looks like it. Right? Poor logic. If they were lies, I would have problems. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Again I have to ask - do you actually read what people post in response to you? Let's try this - I'm not talking about what they look like. I'm talking about their cellular structure. I'm not talking about what they look like. I'm talking about their cellular structure. I'm not talking about what they look like. I'm talking about their cellular structure. I'm not talking about what they look like. I'm talking about their cellular structure. Capiche? Which they are. So you do. So then you actually believe their claims such as that emergency contraception, the Pill, Depo-Provera , and Norplant   are unsafe abortifacients and abortion causes breast cancer and severe psychological trauma? Have you actually researched the validity ( lack thereof in this case ) of these claims?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>That doesn't matter. The infant doesn't have sperm, does that mean it doesn't have a right to live? The infant only weights about 7 lbs, verses an adult who weighs around 130. Does that mean it doesn't have rights either? Genetically, Down's syndrome patients are corrupt - they have too many or too little chromosones. Do they not have rights to life either? I mean, our cellular structure is ALWAYS different in the cycle of life, and further some defected humans have different cellular structures as well, does that mean that we can kill people of ONE kind of these structures? Well, I don't know too much about it, but I've heard that it does, though I also heard on the news last year that these were proven false, but only one aspect. From my understanding, the reason why abortion is dangerous is that you're prematurly opening the uterus to get the fetus ou and kill it, and the body is already on a 9 - month cycle to take care of the fetus, and when you suddenly stop it like that it causes problems - just like premature births. I don't know too much about it though.

Why do you, Voice of Reason, characterize women's decisions to have abortions as ' arbitrary '? 2.

Could you please reiterate these reasons here ( preferably in an enumerated list ) and explain why they should be considered arbitrary? Indeed. But we've established that supposing a higher profile in the media in no way entails an actual increase in incidents.

Given the media's liberal bias, how do you know that number is accurate? I don't know whether there were less or more abortion procedures than the 40,000,000 that you quote. That's what I think we need to corroborate. Also, when you say " this country " I'm going to assume you mean the USA. I'm from Canada and our abortion rate is somewhat different from yours. According to your government, specifically their CDC agency, the rate of abortions is dropping. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5404a6.htm http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5309a1.htm Given the size of your country and your rates of abortion, despite the recent decline, 40,000,000 strikes me as a low number I'm not trying to attack you. I did take the time to go through the thread. Unfortunately I can't find the reasons that you cite, which is why I asked you to repost them so we could discuss them.

They must be taken as soon as possible. Denying any woman -- especially a rural woman -- that cushion of time is unthinkable IMO. I mean, she's already had to see a doctor, who has made an educated decision about what's best for the woman. And, oddly enough, the morning after pill in no way causes an abortion. It prevents a pregnancy, not unlike birth control pills, which they are. I think there's a huge difference between a pharmacy offering products for sale and the pharmacists refusing to sell them, and a store deciding not to stock certain items.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I suggest you re-read things on the morning after pill.... It will do three things ; prevent the sperm from reaching the egg, stop the release of the egg, of if the egg is fertiziled it will keep it from attaching. The third is an abortion. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Well, if that is your definition of abortion we don't have much to discuss. Oddly, delaying a woman her right to morning after pills makes option three more likely, doesn't it? Shouldn't we be doing all we can to make sure she receives her legal prescription without delay? What good does it do a pharmacist to glare at her when time is of the essence? Shouldn't we be truly happy that abortions are down over 10 percent in the last decade in part because morning after pills have become available?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>yeeeeeah, once again, it is an abortion... and a forced one at that. abortion really just means the ending of a pregnancy, however, for what we use it for it really kinda means the unnatural ending of a pregnancy. So for those that believe life begins at conception then the morning after pill would be the killing of a human life and thus that person would believe it to be wrong. Whether it is killed 1 day after or 5 months after is irrelevant as it is the same result. So for the pharmacist that believes abortion to be murder, he would not prescribe it. so abortions aren't down 10 percent... just abortions at clinics are... not only that, I don't believe abortions have gone down that much <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Like I said, we don't have much to discuss, especially since you didn't answer my questions.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>oh they were answered... but if you wish me to rephrase... No, as they are not options.. it does them all. Either way, since the pharamcist doesn't know, it still might be an abortion. No, once again, if it kills a person then that kinda defeats the purpose of a pharmacists ( assuming the pharamacist is pro-life ) What's done is done... only thing the pharmacist can do is have a chance at killing a human. You seem to be missing the point with all of these. The pharamicists that don't believe in the morning after pill think it might give the women an abortion and thus don't want to take the chance of being morally responsible for the death of another. Same reason Wal-Mart doesn't sell certain CDs and Magazines.. they don't want to be a part of that. Already answered. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>It's you who's missing the point -- two of them. By witholding a legal prescription from a woman, a pharmacist is greatly increasing the chance that the woman does indeed become pregnant, with the remedy becoming a clinical abortion. All his high and mighty " principles " are accomplishing is to increase the number of abortions needed. Second, Wal-Mart can decline to sell anything, at anytime and anywhere it so wishes. I don't know how to make that any clearer, but if I need to continue to stress that red herring, I will. If you are an employee your moral responsibility is to not work for the company if you disagree with their policies or with what they sell, not to discriminate against its customers. What kind of a lily-livered movement is this? Pharmacists pretending to stand firm in their personal convictions, with the only result being an increase in the behavior they claim to be against, but unwilling to do the right, principled thing : quit. It's called grandstanding, and it comes at the expense of a frightened woman in need.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>So a pharamicist that is running is own shop would be ok to do it then. Haven't I said this the whole time? If Walgreens says " you have to sell what the customer wants " then if the pharamcists doesn't do it then they should be able to fire them for not doing their job. If the Walgreens says " it is up to the best judgement of the pharamicist " then I see no problem with him / her refusing to serve. When I was working at a gas station some years ago I could refuse to sell cigarettes to people over 18 if I wanted. It would be the women getting the abortion though and not the pharmacist wouldn't have " blood " on his hands. Remember, the morning after pill still can abort and really that is the main point.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3901_82_76__83_89_90_93_94_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Altruism = unselfish concern for others. Strictly speaking, I think that anything a human chooses to do is done in that human's self-interest. If I have concern for others, it is because I have been in that place and I hope that if I were in that place again others would have concern for me. If, on occasion, I can leap the bounds of my experience and have concern for others who are in situations that I have never suffered it is because I would never like to be in the same situation and, again, I would hope that others would, likewise, be concerned about my situation should it be my fate to suffer such a state. I see absolutely nothing at all wrong with self-interest if it does not oppress the self-interests of others unless those others are oppressing the self-interests of others. And, furthermore, I think I might start a School of New Philosophy based on the righteousness of self-interest.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So you only concern yourself with persons in a condition where you may one day find yourself in, because if you help them then somebody might help you also one day. Well, it doesn    t follow that because you help somebody that person will return you the favor. Also you wouldn    t help animals with which you can not identify and of course can never help you in return. If you ever found a school of ethics based on these principles you can for sure count me out. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You raise an interesting point, Winston Smith. However, I do help animals and I do get a payback. I FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHAT I DID. Ergo, I did it in my self-interest. In regard to helping someone who will never pay me back, likely, I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT TOO. Ergo, again I act in my self-interest. I also do an act for a human with the hope that, even if that particular human does not pay me back, another human might see my situation, take pity upon me and render unto me what I rendered to the original person in this scenario -- BECAUSE A PRECEDENT OF DECENT BEHAVIOR HAS BEEN SET. Ergo, my payback. Understand?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>How can this good Samaritan that comes to your help possibly know that once Simone helped somebody in the same predicament and therefore set a precedent and a compulsory precedent by the way, therefore the good Samaritan has to help you. What nonsense is this? What if the good Samaritan says    I already got enough    feel good paybacks    for today, and I am feeling pretty good already, so sorry Simone and good bye    Understand?? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Does a quick statistical calculation, using various factors culled from around the universe. Hmm, sorry, W Smith, that is not likely to happen and I'll take my chances on the small odds. The odds are very much greater that it will. This is the way, in the Universe of Good Will, that precedents of goodness proceed. It takes a great deal of negative will and evil to upset such precedents. All though, to be sure, circumstances occur in which such things happen -- witness Hitler in Nazi Germany, desperate times in which people quashed the good feelings that occur after doing a good deed. Heed the teachings of the Dalai Lama and let bliss descend upon you! The bliss of being good!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Now I see that your position has evolved from : altruism doesn    t exist because people    profit    from altruistic acts, therefore altruists acts are really selfish acts, and I don    t want to go back to that debate, to the new position that there seems to be some sort of universal goodness reservoir that impels people to do good acts, so altruism does exist after all? So far as I know the Indians believe that the amount of Good is always equal to the amount of Evil in the world therefore any    evil    action creates and equal and opposite    good    action to keep the balance. So going back to your example of Hitler, whatever evil he did, and he did plenty, was compensated by other people doing good. In other words Hitler indirectly did a lot of good. Great isn    t? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Actually, I made reference to Buddhist beliefs rather than Hindu beliefs about the balance of Karma. I find no sensible reason for believing in a balance between GOOD and EVIL. There is GOOD. There is EVIL. We humans are free to choose between the two. I choose, when I am aware of the result of my act being good or evil, to do that which causes good simply because, to quote Martha Stewart, " It's a good thing " to do and it makes me feel good. My payback. Hopefully there is more good than evil in the world.

[ / QUOTE It's only justified if your defending yourselve and death is the only choice to save your own life. For example, say a women has cancer and when it would be treated it would kill the baby. Usually the mother waits until the baby is born to treat it, but by then their cancer may beyond being treated. Or someone is reaching for knife to kill you and you have a gun so you shoot him. That is justifiable. Killing it because you don't want to go through with the pregnancy is stupid. The baby is innocent, it is not threatening your life at all. Killing the baby would be evil anyway.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Evil even if it is to save her own life? What if she is taking medication for her severe depression ( suicidal tendencies ), but that medication would cause the fetus to be fatally deformed and almost guaranteed to cause a miscarriage? On one hand, is it right to legally force her to continue a pregnancy that she knows won't be complete, or force her to go off the medication that makes her able to function in life? Evil? Forcing either of these by law is evil and oppressive. Perhaps your option is to take her off the medication and lock her up until the thing you're really concerned about is born. I like how at first murder is never justified, then it's killing is never justified, now it's only some killing is justified. I happen to think an abortion is justified killing. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Didn't you read what I just said. It is not bad or evil to kill the baby if the baby is threatening your own life.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Why though? It is a human, it can think, it is not its fault that it is there! Why should we be allowed to kill an innocent human who is not at fault for this? Why should the woman be allowed to play god and kill a creature that has done her no harm? It is not its fault that the pregnancy might kill her. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>What I meant was, if the mother was to go through with the pregnancy, knowing that it would kill her and the baby, then, and pretty much only then, could the mother use abortion.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Why should she even do it then? Why should she be allowed to kill a person that is not threatening her life on purpose? Is it its fault that the pregnancy is killing her? Shouldn't she be a good mother and sacrifice herself if it gives the fetus even a chance at life? I mean, after all, it isn't her body, so why should she be able to control what happens to the fetus like that? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Um... if the fetus was going to die and kill the mother if she continued the pregnancy, then both of them would die. Then you would only be able to safe the mother. If the doctors knew the fetus was going to die and bring the mother with him / her then you would safe the mother using abortion. The baby should also be druged so ti could not feel the pain. Perhaps I was not clear enough or you misread the post.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>So we are under no moral obligation to allow the fetus to live as long as it would naturally live? Are we under a moral obligation to allow it to live if birthing would kill the mother, but it could survive for a few days outside the womb? A few weeks? A month? At what point do we allow it to live, but kill the mother? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>If the baby was doomed to die anyway, then killing it to save the mother would be okay. But the clinic should give it plenty of pain killer. hmm... mabye they should just overdose it with painkiller.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>We're all doomed to die :P The question is how long we live.

In MOST cases of abortion, the doctor doesn't sit down with a woman and tell her that she MUST have the abortion or else, therefore the judgment of whether it is or isn't a necessity isn't MINE, but a doctor's, and most abortions just aren't LOL, NOW NOW, if you have a point I eagerly point it out, so I would consider that losing with an excess of grace actually :-P<br><b> S2:2-  </b>hehe, always ;) Or perhaps it's akin to a woman giving birth to a stillborn baby and not wanting too look at it, or a woman who know's she is giving the baby up for adoption not wanting to look at it.

Well, at least you agreed that laws shouldn't decide it, but on an individual basis. Now all we have to do is agree on what " life threatening " ( ie, necessary ) is. Is it only her death that makes it legal, or is significant health risk enough? Is above 50% chance of death enough to make it legal, or is it only certain death? Is mental health an issue? There is medication that woman take for different mental health conditions that can almost guarantee a serious deformity in a fetus. Can a woman get an abortion for chemotherapy ( since the fetus cannot survive the procedure ), even if the cancer won't kill for many years?

Better than a group that wants to force motherhood on unwilling victims, not caring if they are unable to physically, financially, emotionally or mentally. Very uncaring, if you ask me. ;)<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Are you serious? The fact that PP covers up crimes against minors doesn't bother you? http://www.clinicworker.com/LegalTrouble.html#naf http://www.childpredators.com/CoverUp.cfm http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/ar...TICLE_ID=28154 http://www.christiangallery.com/11thcircuitPP.htm Linguistic revisionist?! I could have said " ripped a baby from its mother's womb " but I chose " fetus " instead. It was an accurate description of the practice of abortion. I'm sorry if you find it offensive ; I find abortion offensive and trying to sugar-coat the process with acronyms misleading. It's not a pregnancy termination, Dusting and Cleaning ( D & C ), D & E or MVA. It's the forcable removal of a living fetus from its mother's womb. Period. At least have the intellectual honesty to call a " spade " a " spade ". In China, they kill unwanted daughters because they are only allowed to have one child. Do you condone this practice? After all, they are only doing so because they can't afford to support more than one child. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I never said that. I was waiting for you to include your conclusions. You posted the links then kinda left it :P " Ripped a fetus from it's mother's womb " is inaccurate when describing abortions. There are many different procedures, some even non-surgical, that wouldn't even come close to anything like that. To use that phrase to describe all abortion is purely emotional blackmail and completely inaccurate. That's what I find offensive. And do you think this practise is better than getting an abortion? Is abortion illegal there? Perhaps the woman should abort as soon as she knows she is pregnant.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I didn't realize that I needed to spoonfeed the conclusion. Wasn't it obvious? Did I say that it represented " ALL abortions "? Don't try to put words in my mouth ; I'm quite capable of doing that myself, thank you. :) What's this sound like to you? Would you have preferred if I had said " the fetus is sucked from the mother's womb " instead? Here's an interesting fact that I found on PP's website : After 20 weeks gestation there is no statistically significant difference in maternal mortality rates between terminating a pregnancy by abortion and carrying it to term ( Paul et al., 1999 ). To me, that seems to bring into question the theory that late-term abortions are performed to save the mother's life. The fact is that the mortality rate is the same as going full-term. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>If you want to discuss just the websites, start a new thread. If it is relavent to what we are discussing, draw a conclusion that relates to what we are saying from the sites. That's what you do during a debate :) By stating " how could I ever question the pure motives of a group that wants nothing more than to rip fetuses from their mothers ' wombs " you imply that's what an abortion is, and just now you admitted that's not what happens during an abortion. You also said : Which is certainly stating what you think abortion ( all abortion ) is. It would be helpful if you are clear with what you say in the first place so I do not have to " put words in your mouth ". When refering to those methods, the above would be much more accurate, but still incomplete. To me, it seems that you do admit that there is a mortality rate for carrying the fetus to term :) Therefore there are times that abortion can save the mother ;) As with any surgical procedure, there is risk :( As long as the mother is willing to undertake that risk and we do all we can to make that procedure safe, that's all we can do.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-5844_5_4__8_10_12_16_17_18_20_21_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I always thought the " inability to survive on its own " idea was a lame argument used by pro-abortionists, but its not that way for all of them. The others will say this when they are confronted by someone who believes a baby ( however young ) has the right to live from birth as a means to draw away from the facts and confuse the pro-lifer. They lead you into arguements about how old a baby has to be to be worthy of rights, what it requires, does it require consciousness and a means to feel pain in order to make what they're doing wrong and so on and so on. It leads you round and round until suddenly you're being attacked in the debate instead of you the pro-abortionist by your idea of life beginning at conception. This has happened to me several times, and I've lost my mind with it. So not only do I believe this arguement to be lame, it is also a trap to confuse the pro-lifer with issues that are meaningless if they truly believe life begins at conception.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Rather than complaining about what " they " do, why don't you make a point? I am not sure what yours is here. I thought you went home. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>My point was to show what I thought of pro-abortionist's reasons for bringing up the arguement of independant survival for reasons other than being lame at debating. Look at my post for Sinjin.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well could you please explain it again, because I don't understand what you were saying? I don't even understand the current comment. Thanks. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Fine. There have been two reasons ( I've seen so far ) that pro-abortionists have for using the " independant survival " arguement. 1. Because they can't think of anything else to say and end up sounding ridiculous. 2. Because they are confronted by a pro-lifer who believes a baby is a baby with rights from the moment of conception. They can't get through that wall, so they bring up technicalities like not having a conscience or a brain or senses. They do this to confuse the person and then challenge them on their scientific knowledge of the human anatomy and its growth. By then, the pro-lifer who is attacking the pro-abortionist is suddenly on the defense because their field in science may be limited compared to the pro-abortionist. Whether or not the pro-abortionist is really as smart as he / she claims. And with the pro-lifer looking stupid, objective viewers will begin to think the pro-abortionist is right. It's a clever weapon, but all the pro-lifer has to do is laugh and ignore it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>OK. Let's see if I have this correct. In your view, persons who have a different opinion than you on this abortion debate in a forum on abortion, simply have no valid argument and are simply " wrong ". ( This is called keeping an open mind, I suppose. ) If they discuss the scientific or medical aspects of this medical condition callled pregnancy, they do so only to confuse people like you who don't know enough to discuss the scientific / medical aspects. I say with all the respect your post deserves, that is a rather childish approach to debate and to life. You might consider that not knowing something ( this is called ignorance, a word that you use, in my opinion, frequently incorrectly ) is a potential learning opportunity. What is the point of being in this forum, if you have this opinion? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Uh-uh, we are talking about one specific argument here. Not all of them. That applies to everything I said here. And to make the pro-lifer look dumb in the process, making the objective viewer to take what seems to be the smartest side. That's the only motive I see behind the " independant survival " arugement. Other times I can't tell if that is really what they believe or not. Oh, I came here to learn. And I've learned a lot concerning both sides of the abortion controversy.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>How do you make someone " look dumb " if they are not? An " objective " observer would not " take the side " of what seems to be. That would not be objective. If one happens to have factual information about a topic, that doesn't make them " smart ", that makes them informed. Are you saying a lack of knowledge about a topic is in some way desirable or admirable? And how can one intelligently debate without all the facts? I guess you would have to debate solely on uninformed opinions or what someone else told you. Your comments above belie that position. It seems you come here to parrot what your momma told you. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Even if they are just informed, an objective viewer, or I should say : an objective viewer with the same amount of knowledge on the un-informed pro-lifer will think that the pro-abortionist is smarter and knows more and may even begin to believe the pro-abortionist is right. The same thing happened between someone who debated Thomas Huxley on the issue of evolution. I can't remember the anti-evolution guy's name, but he didn't know as much about science as Thomas Huxley and the majority of the people believe Thomas. Not necessarily because Thomas was right, but because he sounded smarter. That is how things work. You would. And it is more convincing.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Oh my. How can I put this? That is a staggeringly inane comment. I don't know where to begin. I actually gasped when I read it. You are very confused, it seems. You appear to eshcew - or worse fear - learning new things. Just because someone has statements of apparent fact you have never heard before, it doesn't make that person smarter, it doesn't make the facts accurate and it doesn't make a valid argument. You have to think in life. You are saying that the other guy is simply " wrong " no matter what. He has no possible argument so makes up (?? ) stuff to confuse the uninformed. Although you are not aware of the facts of his argument, you are certain they are false, but you feel no compunction to verify the facts, you simply dismiss them, for if they were true they might weaken your argument. This is no way to go through life, boy. Uniformed is not a good way to be.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-2781_97_90__100_109_112_116_129_132_4<br><b>S1:1-  </b>jitobear, I am deeply sorry about the experiences you have had with men. Your experience is only too, too true. Men in our culture are worshipped as being next to God in the Christian religion and are not encouraged to grow up into responsible, real human beings with respect for women. I was fortunate to grow up in a relatively non-Christian culture where more was expected from men -- and I never ran into any major problems of abuse and disrespect until I lived for a spell in very Roman Catholic Alburquerque, New Mexico.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The more that I read your posts, the more convinced that you have lived a rather sheltered life. First, there's no such thing as a monolithic Christian culture. There are shades of gray everywhere. In the North, two-income families with shared responsibilities, are the norm. I'm not seeing a lot of foot-kissing going on here. In the South, there are areas where more strict Christian beliefs are practiced, but I'd hardly say that the men aren't responsible. Quite the contrary, in many strict households, the husband is the sole breadwinner and may work multiple jobs to make ends meet. I'd hardly call that being worshipped and irresponsible. Where did you live that was relatively " non-Christian " in the US? I can't think of too many places other than nearby Dearborn, MI which has a very high Middle East population where women are certainly not treated as equals with men. Please " enlighten me " <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I quite agree, Sartre, not all Christians are alike. As a matter of fact, a number of Christian groups created an underground to ensure that women could have access to safe abortion prior to the Roe v. Wade decision. You cite a great many instances of truth. Unfortunately, if a female is considered as having morally " slipped " under these strict rules she has lowered her status to that of a prostitute and is no longer respected and protected -- in fact, her life may be subject to abuse and possible death -- something like the Middle Eastern culture you cite in your next paragraph. I grew up in the very Christian American Midwest but I lived in a tribal Scandinavian family where we had our own rules of conduct, which rules were generally morally superior to the Christian culture surrounding us.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>And I would say that they must not be very Christian to do so. Now, your credibility is really taking a hit. We don't live in the age of the Scarlet Letter. No women are ostricized or banished because they have morally slipped. Where do you get these absurd ideas? How about some examples that demonstrate the differences? I don't know anything about tribal Scandanavian rules of conduct and would like to hear about them. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Oh, that's right, the South has changed -- somewhat. Guess you can hear the N-word uttered in a number of places still -- by white folks. This refers to my own tribal family only. We just liked making our own rules and we were not hypocritical about them. In general, marriages were love matches and life-long without infidelities. Some individuals did not adhere to these rules and they were not well thought of. But we didn't go around being hypocritical about the " sanctity of the marriage, " and yammering on and on about it, we just honored the vows. We flat out speak the truth and are not liked for being so ruthlessly honest. We have little tolerance for BS meant to deceive and mislead honest folk. If we say we're going to do something, we can be expected to do it most of the time. We don't try to be liked, we try to be the sort that we in our family respect and do not feel pressured by society to conform to stupid fads and rules that don't make sense.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>What's that have to do with your statement below? Nice attempt to steer the topic away from your silly assertion. So far, it sounds like MY religion. Oh, so you're not hypocritical about the sanctity of marriage, you just think poorly about people who don't adhere to your rules, which include the sanctity of marriage? Somehow that sounds hypocritical to me. You're cracking me up with statements like the one highlighted above. It's like saying " we're honest.... well most of the time. " LOL <br><b>S1:4-  </b>OK, so you absolutely, positively, keep your word 100% of the time, no matter what the circumstances, like even if you had to chop an arm off to keep your word. I'm not claiming to be a perfect human being who is godlike and always able to keep my word. I'm afraid that I would be a liar if I made such a claim. I've never had any complaints about my conduct.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I'm sorry, I just found the statement funny. Of course, it's impossible to keep your word 100% of the time. And the fact that you acknowledged that in your statement probably reinforced your statement about your honesty.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-2781_22_21__23_25_27_28_29_31_33_34_35_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Agreed. Unfortunately, the Catholic Church is doing neither of those things. When the church does little to stop it, that is when you condemn the whole church.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Thanks Maximus ;) Little? Little? Are you kidding me? The Catholic Church has done MORE than enough to stop these actions. The Church has given literally HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of dollars to the families of abused victims. You're also ignorant in thinking this is something easy to control -- it's not. We may always have pedophile priests, and we'll never know who they are. The best thing we can do now is prevent children from being hurt from such priests. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No. Settlement money is not    trying to stop these actions   . That is covering it up. It is keeping it quiet. Punishing those who do these things would help prevent these actions. In many cases, I    ve read, they simply transfer the offender to a different area where he is not known. This is partly why I condemn the church. I never suggested it is easy to control. In fact, I believe it is something intrinsic in the church that causes it to happen, so no I do not believe this will be expunged easily. This means nothing, I still condemn the church for doing little to stop it. Given how little the church does to identify and remove them, I think a good tactic is to avoid the church altogether.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Settlement money is far from quiet, in fact it is well known. What a foolish thing to imply the church is trying to hush victims. That's just completely ridiculous. You have absolutely no evidence to support such a claim. Moving priests around parish to parish for pedophilia was NOT common among most dioceses, only with the Boston dioecese. All priests are moved from parish to parish regardless of whether or not they're pedophiles ( actually, part of the reason they do this is so that such events DON'T occur, as once priests are settled in a parish they often commit acts contrary to the church, such as adultery, homosexuality, and of course, pedophilia. The church has met dozens of times concerning this issue, and is now more strict than ever with priest ordinations. How would you solve the problem in the church, may I ask? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Simply settling is almost always preferable to a drawn out trial if you want to avoid focus on it. Which is part of why I think sexual problems are inherent in the church. And yet, just recently a gay bishop was ordained? However often they meet, it is unforgivable that it has gone on so long and is so sytematic. Me? I would dissolve the church :) Though, I'm not a big fan so take that with a grain of salt.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>What would going to trial solve? Absolutely nothing! Please explain how it is the reason for seuxal problems in the church. That Gay Bishop wasn't a Catholic one, he was Anglican. Catholics and Anglican are very much different. Catholics are Catholics, Anglicans are protestants. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>And would generate bad press, etc. They wanted it to go away, so they settled. I'll answer with a question. Why would you think staying in one place would make a priest more likely to behave in an immoral way, sexually? Truly told, I could care less. I have little use for religion in general.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>So, you want it to generate bad press? The Catholic Church certianly isn't hiding anything ( the media has already publicized everything ), but why go to court and give the family absolutely NO benefit, and just embarass and put guilt on the Church more. What on earth is with everyone on this forum trying to answer questions with a question? On my debate team, I would be pointed off for doing such things. I refuse to answer the question until YOU answer mine. For the record, priests are moved every six to nine years, unless the priest is given permission to leave early or stay for longer, and unless the priest is retired at a parish. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Why does it matter what I want? The church would like nothing better than for no one to know their shame. They wanted to shut the families up, so they settled. I wasn't aware this was an epidemic Refuse all you want. I have no vested interest in this discussion. The reason that priests tend to behave immorally sexually after a certain amount of time is likely the same reason I believe sexual immorality is inherent, or at least inevitable, in or because of the church teachings, doctrine and dogma.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>My God, do you honestly have any other evidence for your arguments other than your fantasy about the church having an evil anti-family conspiracy? What such teachings / dogma ( Doctrine is dogma ) are these? The reason why pedophilia is occuring in the church is because of homosexual catholics who join the priesthood to avoid sin. However, instead of avoiding sin, they walk right into it. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I don't think it has an anti-family bent, in this at least. I think that it, like any business, didn't want bad press so did what they could to limit it. Also, like an individual, they wanted their shame to be quietly put to rest. I do think you are in denial. Not everything the church does is good and pure ;) They didn't want the accusations to come out, and they didn't want the accusations be be drug out. So they settled. Celibacy and sexual repression, in a nutshell. Would take too much time and research to give a more complete answer. I truly think that is denial of the problem. It is ignoring the problem to simply dismiss them as homosexuals ( whom you condemn anyway ) instead of thinking perhaps the Catholic view of sex might be a factor.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8662_35_34__36_37_38_39_43_46_47_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Some folks will go to any length to keep from discussing the real topic. Who gets to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy - the nanny state or the woman herself? Chuz, you are quite verbose on other topics. Why do you not hazard an answer to a rather simple question?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>When you agrre and accept the fact that a human individual's life biologicaklly begins at and by their conception, Chester? Then I will move on to some of the other aspects of the debate. It makes no logical sense to debate the " what if's " and the " what whens " if we can't agree on the " what is. " <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Why not just shuffle off to Buffalo? Face facts. You don't want to deal with the question, because you haven't thought through the ramifications of your absurd POV.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You are so confident in your views, Chester... Why don't you challenge me to a moderated one on one debate?? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Why don't you put your views out here for all to see? Mine are clear. No one, NO ONE - not you, not I, not the government - NO ONE but the pregnant woman has the right to an opinion on the question of whether or not she chooses to carry her pregnancy to term. She and she alone has the right to make the choice. Can that be any clearer? Now what is YOUR POV.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>My point of view is quite simple ; " I believe a person's rights begin when their life does and not just when society can't justify their denial any longer. " " My point of view is that all else ( where abortion is concerned ) is secondary to that fact. " Now, Chester,... so far no-one wants to be honest and admit that all your side has is " denial " going for them. So here I will remain fixated until we can all agree that ( at least ) biologically a human individual's life begins at and by their conception. And so far, it has been working out great for me by the way. I'm discovering all sorts of new links and references and ways of supporting my views while being here. And all that will be reflected in my website some day ( soon I hope. ) So, ( so far as I am concerned ) the sooner you and some others want to acknowledge that a human being's life biologically begins at conception, the sooner we can move on to other aspects of the issue. You can start whatever threads you want to without me. But I won't be there until this one is resolved, here. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>See, I don't have to prove a single thing. Your handle here says it all when you entitle yourself what you do. That's a ringing endorsement of the pro-choice position. If a pregnant woman chooses to carry her pregnancy to term, your handle supports that ; if she makes a different choice, your handle supports that as well. That's the essence of our POV. I would say, " Welcome to the pro-choice side of the issue. ", but I don't need to. Your handle here indicates that you are already among us.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I have always been " pro-choice, " Chester. ( You never bothered to ask the questions that would have revealed that ) I'm " pro-choice " for all people... Even criminals! We all make " choices " in life and I wouldn't want anyone messing with my right to choose anything. Nor do I seek to control anyone elses right to " choose. " Choice is an inherent part of our human nature. However, ( unlike you, where elective abortion is concerned )... I believe that there are justifications for having consequences for some of the " choices " people make. Your right to swing your fists ( for example ) ends at the tip of someone else's nose. You may have the " right to choose " to rape or molest someone,... But you don't have the right to violate another's rights without fear of consequences. ( or without the expectation that there could be consequences, either. ) Your rights end where another's rights begin. ( keyword : begin ) You say that you believe a person's right to their life should begin when their life does,... yet you run from the debate of when that moment occurs. It's very telling. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Sorry to disappoint you, but I have been consistent throughout the time that I have been posting here. A person's life begins with their first breath, not before. Now, who do you think is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy - the nanny state or the woman herself? :)</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7464_22_14__24_28_30_32_33_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Jito, of course all of the reasons you mention are the staple excuses that are normally given. But since when are they the real reason that motivates the woman. Last night I got a call from a Political Surveyor who asked me multiple questions regarding this election cycle. One set of questions were about what issues were most important to me regarding the Presidential election. I said that all of them were valid and important issues that I cared about, about 8 in total. She responded that I was allowed to pick as many as 3 issues that I cared about but the program didn't allow for me to pick all of them. So it is with the questionnaires every woman who gets an abortion must fill out. They have questions about why they are seeking it but not one option is to prevent wide hips, sagging boobs, a ponch stomach or not ready to stop partying, drinking or drugging. Those options aren't even made available to choose as the real reasons why women abort their babies so in your World, they don't even exist. Talk about being told what you must think and buying it hook line and sinker. Get out of that box jito, it has to be awfully tight in there.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What evidence do you have that they aren't? The most thorough stats I provided were from a PRO-LIFE website. I have provided stats and evidence - you have provided NOTHING. You have zero credibility here. None. Nada. Zip. I doubt highly that they have to fill it out at all. You are either a complete misogynist or not man enough to manage relationships with real women and thereofore the ones you people your life with are useless twits. Just promise me you will never have a daughter. You frankly don't deserve to be within ten feet of any woman. There is an " other " option. No - how about we talk about how I am a woman and a mother and how you don't know $ hit. Like so many Christians I encounter - the main motivator of your faith is complete self-indulgence. You just loooove believing you are morally superior. You don't give a damn about pregnant women and their babies. You just write them off as vain party animals rather than address the real issues or take on trying to actually doing anything to help - but then why would you? Helping them would do nothing to feed your supposed morally superior ego. Pathetic. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I assure you jito my wife is a real woman. And my 2 daughters are fine independent women who love me very much. They have good healthy self images with good healthy relationships with me so they never had to go out and prove they can be loved by having physical relationships with men and having random sex in order to feel like complete women who can be loved by a man. If you had an ounce of understanding why so many American women are promiscuous, with no self respect at all, you wouldn't be defending and justifying abortion, but would be talking about how to rebuild within women a morality based value system in order to stop the all out human carnage taking place in our abortion clinics due to the out of control and irresponsible sex that is taking place in this Country, and around the World. Just because I'm only speaking about the USA, it doesn't mean Europe and Asia is innocent in any way.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Frankly, based on this thread, I pity the women in your life. Now, enough detraction. You claimed that woman have abortions out of vanity and a need to party. THAT is what I am arguing here - nothing else. Back it up or concede. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>As I pity any man dumb enough to attempt to bond with you. Now, as to my beliefs. I have every right to them and to voice them here without proving that anyone else agrees with me at all in order to voice them. So there is nothing to concede as my beliefs are self evident. It would be nice though if you could prove that the results of surveys the abortion industry does to support their own predetermined outcomes weren't fixed and loaded to confirm precisely the results they want to come up with. Of course you will ignore that aspect of this as ignorance is bliss to your side of the issue.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Any man who believes that the most worrisome thing on a woman's mind when facing pregnancy is her breasts is not a man with whom I would wish to bond. The men I associate with regard women far higher. Yes - your beliefs are self-evident. You believe abortion is wrong and you believe women are empty-headed twits who spend their time worrying about their rack ( who knows - maybe that is true for the women in your life. ) But I am not talking about beliefs. I are talking about why women choose abortion. You made an accusation you have yet to back up with anything at all. One that I have completely discredited. It is that particular argument that you need to concede since you have proven NOTHING. And I would like to point out to you AGAIN - that they most thorough stats I provided came from a PRO-LIFE website. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I am saying, and very clearly that for a large percentage of women who have no health issues with abortion, their primary reason for killing their own offspring is because their life priorities are so warped they are more concerned about their physical self image and their lifestyle than the welfare of their own child. Talk about the epitome of selfishness. Not all women, only those women who will kill their own offspring so as not to inconvenience themselves after it is they who acted irresponsibly, not the babies they so easily murder in the name of controlling their own bodies. I have common sense and I supported it with real examples of how surveys and questionnaires are distorted and manipulated in order to get the intended results. Yes jito, but you failed to acknowledge that the pro-life / anti-abortion website that put those stats together got the info from abortion clinics within the Industry which only ask certain questions and are sure not to ask the questions I am asking.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-1305_157_156__170_171_222_224_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Are you serious that you wanted to pitch me that softball? Abortion is the ultimate in selfish because the " mother " decides to kill a fetus instead of letting it live. The desire of the fetus to live is disregarded by the " mother ". Now, if you killed your pet dog because you didn't want to take care of it, you'd consider that a selfish act, wouldn't you?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The fetus is non-sentient, so it has no " desire ". The fetus is totally dependent on a woman's body, and has no existence without the woman's body. This is not the case with a dog. This is not the case with the woman. She is a sentient person, and not a container. She undergoes physical changes and physical risks by being pregnant. She risks, and she sacrifices, using her own body. It is selfish of a man to think he can control her body and her life. It will never have the same kind of impact on his health and on his life, that it will have on hers. Not even close. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>My dog isn't a sentient being so it has no desire and the second part of your argument has nothing to do with the first. Are you arguing that it's OK to kill a non-sentient being or any dependent being regardless of whether or not it's sentient? For instance, an invalid can also be totally dependent on someone else for their existence. Should we " ice " all invalids, too? So let me get your position straight. A woman should have the right to kill her fetus because in rare instances, it can threaten her health? That's a pretty weak argument. Would you like some stats on the number of births VS death of the mother? I'm guessing that death by car accidents are of a far greater concern to the average pregnant woman and there aren't many arguing that the highest risk pregnancies shouldn't have the option of aborting the fetus.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It has more sentience than the fetus in the early stages of pregnancy. No one can force you to use your body for anything against your will. For example, one cannot be forced to give up a kidney. I meant it has an effect on her health. Morning sickness and other problems, the load on her heart increases by 40%, etc. Yes, it could negatively affect her health in more serious ways. It is not a weak argument at all to suggest that those who will have to go through this, should make the choice. I don't understand what you mean here. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>There's no such thing as a little sentience, just like there's no such thing as being a little pregnant. You either are or you aren't. You can be forced to sit in an electric chair and fry under 20 K Volts, can't you? So the sex that created the fetus in the first place probably taxed her heart more than 40%. Maybe if she was so concerned about taxing herself, she would have abstained. It's still a lame argument. The chances of dire consequences from pregnancy are rare, usually predictable and treatable. What I meant was that a pregnant woman has more risk driving in a car than from being pregnant and that I don't know many people who would deny an abortion to a woman who has a significant probability of dying as a result of pregnancy.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I already mentioned I was wrong to put it like that. In certain jurisdictions, if you are a criminal, and it's the punishment directly related to your crime. There are things they can and can't do to the criminal. I am talking about a woman who has comitted no crime, who should have the full and equal rights of every other citizen. Not for very long, and that was her choice, other than in the case of rape. Not lame at all. It directly affects her physically. There is a reason she is continuously monitored during pregnancy. The fetus is totally dependent on her physically.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8503_284_283__285_287_288_289_290_6<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Pappalion, your post is mostly second rate jokes and missing the point ( I have to assumed intentionally ). I believe the following statements of yours continue the core threads though : Define functional. Ah, so you're deciding when it's appropriate to kill? The person who is right. Their position is moral but not correct so I would not accept it. All that is required for a position to be moral is non-immorality. If they satisfy the conditions of morality they have moral beliefs. This is analogous to saying someone is ' X ' when they say ' adding ' two numbers always results in 2 when the criteria for ' X ' is arriving at 2. Now they can say god handed them down two, or anything else but 1 + 1 and they will still be ' X '. Doesn't mean their logic is sound, or any other conclusions are correct though.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Your kidding. Same way one would normally define it in this context and the same way I defined it last time we did this circle. No, but I am also not the one who is justified in telling someone else if they can have an abortion And that would be which one? Morally right is wrong? Yes being moral and immoral at the same time is impossible Are they a moral person who has a moral belief but acts immorally? If they believe it is immoral to kill but do so are they a moral person, not their acts, but the person? No Speaking of unsound logic..... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Then copy paste the normal answer from the last time. ( with post number please ) Then how can you say that killing jews is wrong? The one with a sound argument. ( or a more cogent argument ) Lol, you seriously think I am going to fall for this sad pathetic attempt at equivocation? An incorrect derivation does not necessitate an incorrect answer, one incorrect answer does not invalidate all answers from the same source. People aren't truly moral or immoral, only actions. When we say someone is moral we mean they behave morally for the most part ( or perhaps perfectly ), when we say an idea is moral we mean it pertains to moral / immoral actions ; but the derivation applies only to actions and not even really to beliefs at all.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>We both speak english it isn't difficult. They have rights Which is which one? No mind trick or slight of hand. There is no need for you to fall for anything just provide an answer. It is real simple. It is either right or wrong it isn't right but not wrong or wrong but not right. Wonderful, what idealogical position is not based on a belief? When you say pertains to moral / immoral action it is the belief that the action is one or the other. An action is neither until someone comes along and says this is that and you should or shuld not do it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Then you must be very busy. So you're deciding who has rights? Soundness - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Fine then no. This is the fallacy of equivocation look it up. All positions are beliefs.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>We all must be something OK. No one has rights, making your argument meaningless. The question is not does a person have rights, but at what point do they have them. Yes, philosophy of logic. I remember wondering why the study of logic could not agree on what symbols would be used to express statements using a keyboard. And if niether side is able to provide a sound argument or maybe both can You mean by equating abortion with murder? Because trying to apply it your position of some killing is aceptable and some is not with no objective standard by which to decide except an emotional response you try and pass off as logical. Even the objective ones? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I couldn't claim killing babies was immoral but you couldn't claim shooting abortion doctors was either :p When they exist. Suppose jews never got their rights, who's to say... If two positions are truly contradictory it is not possible for both sides to provide a sound argument. That's why you needed to look it up. It's using the same word in two senses in the same logical stream. Margarine is better than nothing. Nothing is better than butter. Therefore, margarine is better than butter. In this case using right to both mean derived correctly and moral. You ignored the objective standard and presumed emotional authority. Yes, and I've had this particular skirmish before ; I must be living with a different English than posters on this forum because I've never used belief to imply any kind of epistemological origin at all nor has anyone I know. If you've got a less controversial word to mean : : a degree of conviction of the truth of something esp. based on a consideration or examination of the evidence please bring it to me.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8503_258_255__259_266_267_268_270_271_5<br><b>S1:1-  </b>There are no ways of leaving the womb alive other than birth ( unless you know of a secret passage )<br><b> S2:1-  </b>C-section, but I believe he is talking about the intentions of those overseeing the procedure. Such isn't a new moral situation, you have the exact same thing with organ transplants, it's a bit of a red herring though because just because you need to remove the fetus from the mother to save her does not mean you need to kill the fetus ; you can provide the fetus / infant with medical support after it has been removed. If the fetus / infant is at a stage where you can't keep it alive outside of the womb, that's just the state of our medical abilities and it will die like millions of people do because there's no cure. That puts us on the hook if and when we do develop artificial wombs though. It has been noted that not many abortions are late term, well not many are to save the mothers life either. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I would call a child being delivered by c section as being born albeit not a vaginal birth. To be honest I thought it so obvious as not to mention it ( birth being defined as leaving the womb alive ) The secret passage remark was a poor attempt at sarcasm I think number 3 covered the rest of your post<br><b> S2:2-  </b>About #3, would you consider it an abortion if there was never any intention of killing the fetus / infant? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If you are asking whether I think that a delivery that resulted in the death of the infant should be considered a abortion... no. I cant see how it could be. If you are asking about a situation where an invasive procedure such as an amniocentesis test resulted in the fetus being miscarried.. no again. On the other hand I suppose a miscarriage is an abortion of sorts... What did you have in mind Freedom?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You said : If it's not ' viable ' than it will die regardless of the efforts of anyone to save it ; obviously a doctor can't violate an infants rights by trying to save it and failing. The health of the mother will never require the termination of the fetus, at worst it's removal. If any operation in which the intention is not to kill the fetus is not an abortion, than no operation which intends to protect the mother from medical risk is necessarily an abortion. Thus the health of the mother is ultimately irrelevant ; i.e. whether or not you kill the infant is secondary to the procedure and one does not have to make an exception for ' abortions ' which protect the mother from medical risk for as you say they do not need to be abortions proper. AKA rights do not conflict and no ' weighing ' needs to be done on that front, weighing medical risks sure, but not rights. Further I would like to know why pain or stress should be factors, they certainly aren't for other murders except to increase the punishment. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>My definition of a viable fetus in this context was explained by the words in brackets.... that is a fetus that would have a reasonable chance of survival using the technology available. If the mothers health is compromised and the live fetus is removed dead then its a termination. If its removed live its a birth.. both are removal. An abortion should be a stressless and painless procedure for the fetus.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Detected how? Why do any of these matter? Are they supposedly necessary or sufficient conditions? Why? They aren't self-aware, they aren't conscious or rational. Then please justify the idea that child abandonment is immoral. In the frame of reference of the solar system I don't believe that it tuned out to be correct. This too is not proof. It's still your house, and you can't kill the other person. And if the guy with a gun leaves a baby in your house and you escape and come back you still can't kill the baby, and if you throw it out the window you will be abandoning it to die because it cannot live independently. You can't the attempt is sufficient provocation to use lethal force in defense not to execute in cold-blood. When I think it's appropriate is in the defense of your rights or others, and there are no other justifications so yes. I believe it's wrong to murder. It begins when the subject of obligation begins..... but the fetus will of course be alive unless you take actions to kill it, as they do.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8503_223_215_1_224_227_228_231_233_10<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Some believe that the definition depends on the circumstances and the attitude of the mother. A fetus that is aborted but still has some life left in it is still a fetus but a premature baby that is struggling for life and being aided by technology to survive is an infant? I dont believe your assertion that the circumstances change the actual definition of the struggling fetus / infant. Is an aborted fetus that would have a chance to survive with proper after care still a fetus? Is an aborted fetus that has not yet died a fetus or an infant? If so why is a very premature born baby considered an infant? Would it not be more accurate to define it as a fetus? I know that it is very rare for a fetus to be aborted at a late stage in the pregnancy but that does not detract from the need determine where the definition of a fetus ends and an infant starts. I do not believe that it depends on the attitude of the mother or the circumstances of its extraction from the womb. That is so subjective a definition that it is worthless.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Who believes that, exactly? " Fetus " and " infant " are terms that have meanings. We can use them however we want, but that doesn't mean that we're using them correctly. Believe what you will. If birth happened, it's an infant. If not, it's a fetus. No, because birth happened, albeit prematurely. That said, a prematurely born infant is still going through stages of what is ordinarily fetal development. Birth. It's pretty straightforward. To repeat, believe what you will. " Fetus " and " infant " will mean what they mean, regardless of what you believe or don't. What's subjective about it? Birth is an observable process, and marks the divide between normal prenatal and normal postnatal development. If birth happens too early, then what is normally part of the prenatal stage will have to be developed postnatally. Where is there anything subjective about this? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>First you state that ' fetus ' and ' infant ' have no definite meanings then you dispute that their meanings are subjective. You contadict yourself in the same post. The terms fetus and infant seem to be interchangable. An aborted 27 week fetus remains a fetus and a 27 week premature born fetus is elevated to the status of infant<br><b> S2:2-  </b>How is pointing out that terms can be misapplied an indication of contradiction?!? We are always free to disregard the standard of application for a term. That doesn't mean that such usage is correct. And in fact, the idea of a correct usage presupposes that the standard is something non-subjective. Perhaps of the two of us, I'm not the one who misunderstood what I wrote? And yet, they're not. Infants have been born ; fetuses have not. BECAUSE BIRTH IS THE DIVIDING LINE. HOW OFTEN DOES IT NEED TO BE SAID? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>IF BIRTH IS THE DIVIDING LINE THEN AN INDUCED ( induced labour ) ABORTION MAKES THE FETUS AN INFANT THEN DOESNT IT. Arent capital letters fun? Perhaps of the two us you are the one who misunderstood what you wrote?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Yes, it does. Why do you think I would disagree with this? If you look at my immediately preceding post, you'll note that I agree, this is partly true. Any method of abortion that causes birth would make the fetus no longer a fetus. I agree with that assessment. Nothing I said earlier would give any indication otherwise, except that you evidently felt like jumping to conclusions about my position and adding things to it that weren't there. However, as I also said in my now immediately preceding post, you'll note that it is false that abortion always results in birth. Late term abortions and early term abortions are quite different. Yup. Logic is fun, too. Try it. Nope. Perhaps -- no strike that : without any doubt -- as noted above, you added in a bunch of stuff to my position that I didn't say, and then proceeded to criticize me for the stuff you added than for the stuff that I actually said. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>IF BIRTH IS THE DIVIDING LINE THEN AN INDUCED ( induced labour ) ABORTION MAKES THE FETUS AN INFANT THEN DOESNT IT. I have been asserting the above for several posts. I have expressed time and time again that if the fetus was not defined as a infant after birth then the definition would be subjective. You seemed to be more intent to copy and paste what was irrelevant than actually read my posts. I try to keep it simple.

Some people murder and they get the death penalty while others get life in jail... does that make the two lives different in value? I'd say no. The justice system has never worked on a policy of consistency. I'd like to add that the morning after pill does not always destroy a life. Sometimes it prevents like a birth control pill does. This doesn't change anything but should be understood. Right, you will find most Americans are inconsistent in their beliefs. Congrats. On the flip side you will find pro-choice folks that are in fact not always pro-choice. Welcome to reality.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>But as far as I know, people who are convicted of pre-meditated murder don't walk or get fined a few dollars. They get years in jail. Take either punishment you describe, either the death penalty or life in jail ; which do you suppose is the appropriate punishment for a woman who takes the morning after pill? Are you saying a woman who takes the morning after pill is committing first degree murder but shouldn't be punished? Your argument is flawed and exactly the argument I expect from a pro-lifer who really isn't truly pro-life. Let's make this a simple as possible. How much time should a woman who takes the morning after pill spend in jail? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>How is it flawed? I simply stated our justice system is not consistent and never will be. But if you like, if the morning after pill is deemed to be illegal and is considered first degree murder then I would say she should be punished for first degree murder for using it. What you really want to know though is what should the punishment be and this question really doesn't matter. I'm not afraid to say there should be one but I'm also not going to be stupid enough to think you are only consistent if you equate it to other laws when no other law works that way. Dunno, haven't really thought it. I'm not sure just taking a morning after pill is that bad. For example if a male took one I'm not so sure that's a big deal or even a female that just randomly took one.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Ok, now we're getting some where. Obfuscation is phase one. Let's try and make the question more straight forward. The person who takes the morning after pill is a woman. The woman had unprotected sex the night before. The woman, through an X-Ray, ultrasound, or some other means, knows she has a fertilized egg inside her. She decides to take the morning after pill. She takes the morning after pill. What crime has she committed and what is an appropriate punishment? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I assume you mean if it were illegal what laws would I have assuming I could be king. Well, I haven't really thought about it too much. We could also get into the idea of where she got it from... but that aside it seems like it would be similar to current laws where one kills an unborn child ( like Scott Peterson ). I don't recall if it is 2nd degree murder but that seems like the most likely scenario.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Ok, so it's 2nd degree murder. How long should the woman who took the morning after pill go to jail for for committing a 2nd degree murder? And don't fall back on the law or anything else. I am asking you. What do you feel is an appropriate punishment? How long do YOU feel the woman who took the morning after pill should spend in jail to make sure justice is served? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I don't know what the sentencing guidelines are for second degree murder to be honest with you. I think they vary by state. I'm not sure how I could answer it any better. Given an inconsistent legal system I would say the law should be similar to what the law currently says and therefore the closest thing of comparison are unborn child laws which many states have as 2nd degree murder such as the Scott Peterson Case.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Since you like to mention the Scott Peterson case, I looked him up in Wikipedia and this is what I found : " Peterson was sentenced to death and currently resides on death row in San Quentin State Prison. " So you think a woman who takes the morning after pill should be sentenced to death? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I'm not a big fan of the death penalty so no and I don't think Peterson should get the death penalty. Scott Peterson was convicted of a double murder which puts him into the death penalty category. Oddly enough this is another example of how our legal system really is not consistent with itself.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I tried to find some prison sentences for killing an unborn child that did not have associated crimes ( like the mother almost being killed ) : The projected length of stay for the offense of killing an unborn child is 17.6 months. In addition, the bill creates the crime of assault of an unborn child and classifies the crime as a Class B felony punishable by a maximum prison sentence of 10 years, a fine of up to $250,000 or both. Canadian Man Given One Year Sentence for Killing His Unborn Child We have a low of one year, a possible 10 years, and a medium of 17.6 months. So do you think a woman how takes the morning after pill should go to jail for 17.6 months? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I think I stated I support the laws that have an unborn being 2nd degree murder and the penalties as such. If the average for 2nd degree murder is 17.6 months ( and I doubt it is ) then so be it.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Are you saying you think the sentence for 2nd degree murder is longer than 17.6 months, ans so should the sentence for a woman who takes the morning after pill? <br><b>S1:7-  </b>For the fourth or 5th time.... assuming the woman in question was pregnant and the morning after pill caused her to abort then yes. Of course you seem to fail to realize that sentencing and law have nothing to do with whether something is right or wrong. This is exactly why a question of what the law should be is irrelevant until you first decide that the action in question is wrong.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>You would think justice was served if a loved one of yours ( i.e. a sister, an aunt, a cousin, an old girl friend, a current girl friend, your wife, your daughter ) went to jail for at least a year and a half for taking the morning after pill? <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Are you just going to ask the question over and over again?

If you really want to reduce abortion and help babies - you have to do better than this - otherwise you will fail. That or you really don't care. Oh, and not to split hairs - but actually women at this point in time do have the right to terminate their pregnancies ( at least in the US ). <br><b>S1:2-  </b>And we have a lot of women that who have had abortions regretting it the rest of their life including the woman who wast the complaintant in Rowe V Wade.......

But you don't see that. All you see is a baby making machine who has nothing to worry about in this world at all unless she is at death's door. Pregnant women need - food, shelter, safety, medical care, an income, and all the same things you do. They may also be supporting other children. Those issues impact pregnancy - but you absolutely refuse to acknowledge them. You seem to think that all pregnant women are spoiled little rich girls with endless means and you trivialize their issues down to " bad hair days " and " stretch marks ". You are blind and hateful and insulting to every woman alive - including your wife, sisters, and daughters. And who is the horse's behind who reduced helath concerns to a summer without tennis?

If you can't see that then I don't know what to say to you...........</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3153_67_62__71_77_78_80_85_101_105_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Duo, Please go back and read some of the posts... When you say that culture and society norms are the basis then we couldn't ever change anything. If we made our decisions about what is right and wrong on what society says we would never say slavery was wrong. We would look at our culture, see that slavery was ok, and then decide it was ok. This is obviously not true.. because somewhere along the line one person got the idea it was wrong and decided to tell others it was wrong and others believed it... Where did that guy get his idea that it was wrong from? Probably an absolute huh? A story is posted a few pages back that also answers the " culture basis " question. So what is the basis?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why do you say that? Culture and societal norms change. Your argument is based upon that Culture and societal norms don't change. They do, therefore the rest is irrevelant. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Maybe you shoulda read the rest of what I posted. They do change... but BASED ON WHAT? How can you change something if you don't know anything different? Where does the different idea come from? An idea come from some BASIS..... So what is the basis since it can't be society or culture. As no other ideas would come about if it is based on that.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You said they don't change. But then they do. You assume they don't. There are always a huge amount of ideas out there as well as new ones being formed. None of which have to do with absolutism. How about a need? Let's take a example, people needed a " thing " to sit on besides a rock. they invented a crude chair. Where did that idea come from? How so? He saw treatment that was brutal. You don't need a absolute moral view to understand sheer burtality. Cone : I adjusted my position due to the interference by a supernatural power. That changes alot of things don't you think? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I didn't say they don't change... I said they wouldn't change if you based your morals on societies morals. So now the basis is " needs "... you just said it was society. You need a basis for your beliefs. How would someone know that brutal treatment is bad if they had no basis for that.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But societal morals change. So? Society can change its morals on the basis of a " need. " Look at the civil rights. There was a " need " and society changed. How about WWII? morals about what kind of work women should do rapidly changed because of a need. I'm just saying that things change for a number of reasons. Their own basis. Let's take a factory owner. He sees every day workers being horribly mutilated by machines. He has to settle with them and his profit margin decrease. The basis for brutal treatment is his own expierence, often because of the wallet. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Based on what? Again, What basis? So the basis is a need and not society? The need is the base for which morals change according to you now... however, you just said that it was society... why the change? Ok, so the basis is NOT society????<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Alot of stuff. Need is merely one cause of why society changes its morals. It is not the only thing. I'm just saying that things change for a number of reasons. His personal beliefs are not always tied to society. If we want to do that, nothing can ever be proven. As tasty said, such a argument is silly. Let's take this to a new level. No one can prove anything. Absolutes therefore do not exist at all becuase nothing can be proven to be a absolute. This is why you don't argue with a true skeptic! <br><b>S1:5-  </b>This was in response to the " what basis " question. So what stuff? And how does one decide which stuff to use from this " basis " when making a moral decision? Yeah, but once again this means that society is not the basis.. it is simply what changes because of a decision made from a basis. So once again the basis is not society as you said earlier? Exactly!!! I am glad we got here. With the relative mind set nothing can be proven and thus this leads to anarchy. Since we don't have that maybe we should come to a different conclusion.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3153_226_225__227_229_230_231_232_233_4<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Duo, I will happily respond to your last post to me if you so desire. But I think Symbiote has done a pretty good job at explaining what I was trying to explain. I have obviously taken it a little farther in asserting that an absolute moral standard does exist. But I take issue with the relativist position for the reasons Symbiote has stated. As such, I think my attempt to respond to your last post to me would be rather redundant, but If you wish, I will certainly do so.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What? I asked how something can be a apriori truth, which is something discovered not through empirical means yet be that at the same time? Not really. Symbiote has merely proved that neither can be proven. Your argument was that moral absolutism is correct and that moral relativism is wrong. Symbiote didn't argue that. So unless you have changed your position to that moral absolutism and relativism are unprovable, Symbiote has not done a good job at explaining your argument. So now your position has shifted? Then you contridict yourself in stating Symbiote has argued for your position when he clearly did not argue your original one. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No, my original argument was that diversity of opinion does not prove that morality is relative. I then went farther to say that I believe in moral absolutism and in an absolute moral standard. I never said I could empirically prove it. Obviously not. I will briefly refresh your memory. You said : to which I generally replied : to which you said : And I said And here you go again To which I said, and this is key : This is what Symbiote has pointed out I think. then you again : Here i go : you again : Me : Notice I said that I believe the standard could be known. Symbiote has argued that it is not possible to prove that morality is relative. Only that one believes it to be relative. I have done the same thing. Then I went on to talk about my belief in a moral absolute, which we never finished because you won't accept my first assumption. To which I finally said that accorging to your own standard, I could not accept your first assumption. This sounds a lot like Symbiote's point that neither can be proven to me. I'd like to know what Symbiote thinks about this. Symiote, did we essentially argue the same thing? lol, nice try Duo. I think the evidence shows otherwise.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But you did argue that there was a standard. Symbiote clearly wasn't arguing that at all. If you will recall, we left that discussion because it wasn't doing anything. It is not revelant in this one. And therefore could be provable. Symbiote did not argue this, he argued that you cannot prove either. Only if you keep shifiting your argument, yes. HUH? Explain. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I argued that I believed in a standard. I never said I could empirically prove it. Symiote argued my first point, that moral relativism couldn't be proved. The fact that I made a second argument that Symbiote doesn't address nor make does not mean we did not agree on my first argument. Not relevant? You apparently still subscribe to moral relativism, so it is still relevant to try to show you that this cannot be proven. I could offer evidence for my belief, but not the undeniable empirical evidence you were demanding of me. Thing is, you could not offer undeniable empirical evidence of your position either. So if something has to be proven empirically, why do you subscribe to moral relativism? I haven't shifted my argument. I thought you had accepted the proposition that your version of moral relativism had significant problems, the same problems in fact you were accusing my arguments of having. What kind of standard is it to demand of my arguments more than you demand of your own?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Symbiote does address your second argument, just in the opposite fashion. You have stated there are absolutes, yet you have not proven them to be absolutes. That part of the discussion did nothing but waste space. Actually, if i say it cannot be proven, doesn't that prove there aren't absolutes? :p I gave a reason to Symbiote. I suggest you find it. All I needed to do was prove that your absolutes were not absolutes. That I did. merely because you don't wish to address why they are absolutes outside of a " because I said so " doesn't make your claims absolute, it merley says you cannot refute the exceptions. * sigh* I suggest you read the entire thread. Reading such would easily find the answer to that : hint it has to do with assumptions of truth in morals. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You have not proven them not to be. No, because you can't prove that it can't be proved. :p Your reason rests on differing opinions, which proves nothing but the fact that differing opinions exist. You did not disprove my absolutes. I asked you to do so, using the example of genocide, but you declined saying that you already had. If you already had, why would I ask you again? Therefore you should conclude that I did not see your example as an exception. So maybe I was asking you to explain it a little more.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You have proven your unwillingness to prove the exceptions are not exceptions. I asked you to view it from the other side, you blantatly refused. This is getting very stupid very quickly. So will we agree neither side can be proven? [ qupte ] You did not disprove my absolutes. I asked you to do so, using the example of genocide, but you declined saying that you already had. [ / quote ] I already did. Merely becuase you wish to avoid discussing it doesn't make your argument correct. it is not my fault if you are too lazy or unwillingly to comtemplate a different view without embracing it. The sign of true intelligence is the ability to entertain an idea without embracing it.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3110_93_92__94_95_96_98_99_100_101_103_104_106_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I noticed you very conveniently failed to mention that you were wrong about what the name of the bill in the congress is..........<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Eh? What are you talking about? The " partial birth abortion " bill? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You said the bill was not called the PBA bill Kuato corrected you<br><b> S2:2-  </b>lol. The issue was never about the name of the bill. I said there was no medical procedure called " partial birth abortion ". If you read it again, I said : That's great for you, but we're talking about the bill. It does not specify viable or not, nor is there any procedure called " partial birth abortion ". <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yhen why do they call the bill Partial Birth Abortion if there is no procedure called that?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Because if they make up a label, the bill is not limited to a single procedure or gestational age or anything like that. This allows a sort of " backdoor ban " in that it can be used for different procedures for prosecution purposes. Late term abortions ( what ignorant people assume this applies to exclusively ) are used to emotionally charge people. It's a political move to shift focus from early abortion to late abortion since most of the nation disagrees with late term abortions. The interest isn't in banning late term abortion ( there were bills created by democrats that would ban all late term abortion except in cases of grevious physical injury ), the interest is in riling up ignorant people such as yourself that know little about the issue and then dishonestly try to ban early abortions. D & X abortions ( the actual procedure that most associate this bill with, although the bill is not limited to this procedure ) account for less than 1 tenth of 1 percent of abortions performed, so banning just them doesn't really serve these decietful pro-life people's purpose. However, banning " partial birth " is much more useful, since it isn't limited to an actual procedure ( for no actual procedure called " partial birth " exists ) and it's useful for riling up emotions, isn't it? To sum up : For political purposes. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Or perhaps it was directed to non caring people like you who have no compassion or value for human life in the womb and can think only of her miserable selfish existence....... I think the latter applies..........<br><b> S2:4-  </b>haha, who says I'm a she? ;) You do know that when you say " the latter " it implies you had two options. I see only one. I should have figured you could not address the point of my response to you. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>You said you were a while back.... Your option and mine......... You did not address mine either except to attack me personally..... Just because you write a whole bunch of horse manure does not make it so.......<br><b> S2:5-  </b>haha truly? Could you quote me on that? I seriously doubt you can back this up? Nope, I said you were ignorant of the issues involved. I sincerely believe that. It isn't an attack, though it can be insulting. I addressed your question directly. Are you saying it isn't true? Perhaps you would care to debate it then :D <br><b>S1:6-  </b>1. you said it and its not important enough for me to look it up 2. you call someone ignorant. Is that a compliment in your mind? 3. I am saying its smoking mirrors...<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Voice Of Reason, No, I didn't :) No, but it's not an attack. It's a statement about your knowledge on the subject Which, of course, you have no intention of backing up. As usual :p Nurglitch, Because it doesn't simply state that " partial birth abortions " are banned, it's that they have a description within the bill that can apply to different abortion procedures. It's a bit like if I made a bill called the " happy fun time procedure ban " and in the bill itself described the " happy fun time procedure " as " Whenever a physician cuts open the skin for the purpose of removing a part of the body ". Despite the fact that there is no medical procedure called the " happy fun time procedure " doctors can be prosecuted under this bill if they remove tonsils or an appendix or a kidney for a transplant. It could also apply to donating blood, since the skin is punctured and blood is a part of the body. The wording is vague enough to do that.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3110_32_31__33_34_36_38_39_42_43_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Does it mean that we should? Merely because I agree that it should be banned doesn't mean I will support legislation that infringes upon the rights of women. I think alot of things should be done, but not at significent costs. The question lacks such questions. Again, you assume too much<br><b> S2:1-  </b>My induction is sound, and you have not showed it to be incorrect. You need to change your first statement before I will accept your arguments. I have clearly responded to what you said because I included your full statements in my argument, thus showing I have read the whole debate. If you have decided not to make your position clear, you shouldn't be commenting on this topic. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Your induction is based upon a assumption that is not true. I have clearly stated that while I think something should ____ that does not mean I support actual legislation when we account for other factors. That by itself invalides your claims. You need to realize the foundation of your argument has just evaporated. on the contrary, you clearly cited a quote where I was talking about how one should have paid attention to the debates, specifically to Kerry's speech. you failed to comment upon that in your response to such a quote. Therefore, if you are not actually paying attention, you shouldn't be commenting. Look at at Marc 9000, he makes insane comments that have nothing to do with what he quotes. Do you want to look like him?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So is it now safe to say that your initial claim " Partial birth abortion should be banned so long as there is a clause protecting the life of the mother " has now been amended to " Partial birth abortion should be banned so long as there is a clause protecting the life of the mother and other clauses that take into account other factors? " <br><b>S1:3-  </b>In a sense yes. The original question did not include other factors. Also, I wrongfully assumed that people would understand how legislation works and how it affects the rights and lives of the people. I now know not to assume that people will understand the complexities and that I must list how things really work. You have clearly taught me that people are not informed, do not understand how legislation works, clearly are ignorant of consequences and that it is wrong for me to assume the audience is educated. Steeeeve : cone, this is exactly what I am talking about. I cannot assume that the audinece is educated or informed, as Steeeeve here shows. Kerry has voted aganist other abortion bills for the same reason in his history. Vor has attacked his for those as well. While I realize you clearly do not know this, even after I provided the link to his history, you cannot assume there is only one bill. Under such, Vor is still very much a lying hypocrite.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Not informed? How so? Don't understand how legislation works? How so? Ignorant of consequences? How so? You are drawing outright faulty conclusions. The real case is that you were just confusing. The other stuff you assert is based out of the confusion you caused with your original statement. Why? You did not state your position on this issue. You misled readers of this topic by making the following claim : " Partial birth abortion should be banned so long as there is a clause protecting the life of the mother " when you really meant " Partial birth abortion should be banned so long as there is a clause protecting the life of the mother and a clause about other factors as well " As such, I think we have cleared the whole matter up by your admittance that your first statement did not represent your position. I just have a problem when people make a statement that would lead us to believe one thing ( in this case that you support banning partial birth abortion so long as one thing is included ) when the reality is another ( that you support banning partial birth abortion so long as more than one thing is included ). <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The evidence is right here. The fact that we are discussing it. The other stuff is because I wrongfully assumed you people would understand something other then the obvious. So how can I be a hypocrite? In all seriousness, the mere fact we are still talking about it is a sign that I assumed too much. represent my whole position? no. Part of it, yes. However, in dealing with such a simple, complexity avoiding question, I answered in a simple, complexity avoiding answer. The answer fit the question. I can live with that. I now know I cannot assume anything more then the basic knowledge of the audience.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>As far as I'm concerned, this should be the last thing I post about this, but I want it to remain clear that the reason the whole discussion came up is because it wasn't obvious what your position was. Now that it is, we can move on. also, I hope that's a complement to my style. If it is, Thanks :) <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I can live with that. It is. You have a much more refined style as well as few internal problems. Also, you don't ignore alot of stuff when it suits you. Not to mention you don't come blaring out like other people. It's very good, very nice use of tact. Steeeeve : I care. I cannot tolerate his lies, fabrications, and other dishonest behavior.

Far worse than the current war. http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/c/childbirth/deaths.htm Pro-life is not pro-life, its pro-death. And every mother you see is actually a hero.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Can you prove that it is pro-life legislation that causes this or could it be a result that people are not acting is a responsible manner or perhaps even other factors? Why is it that the US allows for the most abortions yet our mortality rate is so high? I see no relationship but it seems you do... please explain. Also, the chances of at least one person dying during an abortion is almost 100% the way I look at so your numbers don't mean much. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Total proof? Course not. We can only see what the factors where during the prohibition and relate the factors to countries under it.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>so you have no evidence at all or any signs of any correlation. Just wanted to clear that up but this isn't the first time you have tried to post misleading or incorrect facts. You've been here a month, its time to learn to be honest. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Losing me Steve, I left websites with the collected data. What your asking me to do is see into the future and count the added dead. Sorry, you think way to highly of me.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Lets look at your first website : http://phoenixwoman.wordpress.com/20...irth-increase/ The reasons they blame for the increase include, women themselves, race, quality of care, and age. Oddly enough not one mention of abortion laws being an issue or any pro-life legislation causing any issue mentioned above. So it seems the one lost is you. Stop spewing garbage " facts " as they just make you look like a dishonest person. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Facts are facts. They can take data and add a conclusion as much as anyone else can. clearly thats reasonable. Personally including age when the data change is less than a decade is questionable to say the least. SO... Guess I'll keep my conclusions<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You can keep your conclusion but it certainly isn't one that follows from the facts given. Aside from my name not being " Steven ", I find your conclusion to be nothing more than wanting a certain conclusion and finding bogus reasoning to get there. In this case the conclusion stated is not even remotely close to what you think it is yet you seem to want a different conclusion but have no evidence, no reasoning, and pretty much nothing other than belief to get a conclusion from those given facts. I wish Another Opinion would respond to this as we both agree that based on given facts you need reason and evidence to at least come to some reasonable conclusion. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>The facts : The rate of deaths are UP.... Not down.......... UP! More women are dieing TODAY which a FACT... ( can not be spun )..... Than when your pretty boys took over. People have reasons Steve ( if not Steven )... The reasons your playing your game of calling me a lyer on... WOULD not change if abortion where outlawed. Are you catching up yet?? The reasons listed are based on what KILLED THE WOMEN.... Their choice killed them and YOU CAN NOT ASK A DEAD WOMAN why she made the NEGATIVE choice. But lets be honest Steve... Lets hold ourself to the same standards... one time and be honest. You know ; you can not say their life threatening choices where NOT made because your media blitzes on fetal worth. In fact, if you can be as honest as I am for one moment, you would have to admit your Dogmatic connections to fetuses having souls and being children would have to have the effects we are seeing. The effects would have to be as the outcome currently is.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Who are my " pretty boys "? I don't recall anyone I really like taking over anything. What effects? You are still being dishonest. There is no indication that abortion laws or pro-life legislation has caused an increase in pregnancy morality. You show no evidence and no correlation and no reasoning... you are being dishonest in your posts. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I am?? Can't we wake up? You can't ask dead people why they chose what they did steve. The reasoning and conclusions are sound. We ( you and I ) know that. A fetal brain doesn't even have enough brain to feel pain or anything, before 20 to 24 weeks ; nothing there. That    s 5 months of gestation for those who don't want to do the math. There are faithful people out there that believe what they are told in Church. They buy into all the information a theologian sells them to the determent of their own lives. You have what is here, the woman, and you have what could possibly be, the fetus. Many people are buying the dogma and giving their lives to it.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>I see you are trying to change the debate after you realize you have no backing for what you claimed. Again, please show me a correlation between pro-life legislation and increase in mortality rates in pregnancy. You already failed to show the 10,000 deaths a year number and you changed the debate on that one too. It is becoming clearer and clearer that you aren't here to debate or offer reasonable discussion as Another Opinion and I believe we should have here but you just want to offer a close-minded view with bogus facts. If this how you want to continue posting then so be it but count me out and I'll just add you to the ignore list now. You can join Jitobear and Chemist on that list :) <br><b>S1:7-  </b>What pro-life legislation? The partalbirth abortion ban?? that? I will show the data next year, it was just passed. Interesting fact Steve... Of all the abortions that would cover, only 10... Just 10 abortions where on a fetus that would have been born and not need life support. No medical text book on the earth has a Paralbirh abortion proceedure. NONE. You could say wow, you get to save ten lifes at the cost it took. but hay, if you where the doctor involved, I wonder how it would have turned out.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>Again you try to change the frame of the debate here showing yet more dishonesty on your part. You said " Under the current Pro-life campaign the deaths of women during child birth has increased by one death per day. " My question was addressing whether or not you could show a correlation between increased morality rate during child birth and the supposed " pro-life campaign " ( which I assume means legislation but this doesn't really matter ). When answering this question you should keep in mind the 4 reasons given for the increase had nothing to do with anything regarding pro-life positions. I also believe you have indirectly answered my question about whether or not you will be honest in debate. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Yes exactly exactly... you got it</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-4544_33_32__35_37_41_42_47_48_52_54_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Every view is taken on faith my friend. Even your " reasoning " is based on logic that is taken on faith.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>" faith " is believing in something in spite of the lack of evidence for it or the evidence against it. with logic, you believe in something because the evidence for it exists. logic is based on the predictable and consistent, faith is not. this is also why the amount of faith required to believe something varies as more evidence is added or removed. when you believe in somthing that is fully supported by evidence, no faith is required <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No, logic is based on faith as well. you say a =b and b = c therefore a = c. But all of this is a faith that a, b, and c exists and that " equals " exists. In logic you are accepting a very basic premise and coming up with conclusions based on that faith based premise.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>i can verify that a, b and c exists, and the concept of " equal " is both testable and consistently predictable. if 2 things are equal, they are the same. in mathematics, 2 equal things are of the same quantity. quantities are measureable. no faith required <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Like Beale said... you believe in the basics as being true... you can't prove they are in fact true. How you prove ' a ' exists? You don't.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>dude, ' a ' is a variable equal to a number i assign to it. if i say it exists, then it exists. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Just because you say so doesn't mean it is. " I say there is a God ".... I guess it must be true if we apply your standard. Just face it. You have faith in something even if you don't realize that you do.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>consider the sentence : " the cow jumped over the moon. " this is sentence exists, because it exists in my mind. the proof that the sentence exists is the expression of the sentence as you just read it. concepts, by nature, need no physical manifestation in order to exist. its a concept, and it exists the moment it is thought in the mind of anybody. a =b is a concept. both a and b exist, because they exist in my mind, and are defined in my mind as variable quanties of equal value. the proof that a and b exists is the expression i just wrote. no faith required not everything works this way. god is not defined as a concept, so god cannot be proven to exist simply by expressing that he exists. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Just like a and b. You just say you thought of it. Well, if I don't think a =b does this mean it doesn't exist? To a newborn they don't know what a or b are. They only exist so much as you have faith in their existence. You have faith in numbers and expressions... thats fine. You can't prove them at all.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>lol a exists because i think about it. you not thinking about a doesnt cause it to stop existing. the proof that a exists is the same as the proof that a sentence, song, image or shape exists. it exists as long as a single mind thinks it up. and it proven to exist when it is expressed in a way that is communicable to another mind. squares exist. the scale of C exists. the sentence " hello, world " exists. no faith required</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-4544_32_28__34_36_44_46_50_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Since no belief system so far has been able to show any proof, no one belief system can be objectively claimed to be more valid than another - thus, they are all taken on faith, not proof. I think we agree that, since none can offer proof, laws should not be based on any one of them but purely on objective reasoning.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Every view is taken on faith my friend. Even your " reasoning " is based on logic that is taken on faith. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>As a scientist, I usually assume that generally accepted scientific views are correct since they have a preponderance of proof, unlike religious views that depend on leaps of faith. By " reasoning ", I refer to logical reasoning that does not need leaps of faith to understand or accept their veracity. That does not mean that I do not take religious leaps of faith - I do, though they are often hard to reconcile with scientific beliefs. However, I strongly believe that, in making laws that affect all people ( not just those of a particular belief system ), the reasoning behind these laws cannot include leaps of faith but be logically based on proveable concepts. On another subject : Does this mean that pro-lifers would be willing to compromise if exceptions for " women's health " were more narrowly defined? Here, I'm talking about compromises that would leave first-trimester abortions up to the mother's choice, and restrict only third ( and possibly also second ) trimester abortions.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Science is faith as well. You first have faith that experiments ( etc ) done in the based are correct. You also have a faith in existence. Science has just as many assumptions as religion does. In fact if we want to use logic then a logic mind would choose to believe in God. Unless you can explain to me the beginning you have taken large leaps of faith. Religion just happens to explain them while logic does not... and science uses the " big bang theory " which is aboug as much of a leap as the religious way. No. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Everything is a matter of degree. The assumption that the world exists ( as opposed to the idea that we are dreaming all of this ) is a basic assumption that everyone in the world makes in order to survive. Even those who ponder its non-existence have to assume its existence to run their everyday lives, so denial of such basic things as the existence of the world or the existence of " equals " ( which is an abstract concept devised by man, not an object - so its existence is automatic ) is merely an academic exercise with no basis in reality. We have to have basic assumptions that what we observe is reality in order to live. Science is based on observeable experience and bad science is usually eventually weeded out through peer review. Religious faith simply makes assumptions without demanding any observeable proof or even self-consistency. Everything is explained by the convenient reason that God is all-powerful and that we cannot know his purposes. If God actually did speak to me directly, then I might also believe in the improbable scenarios that most religious beliefs hold. Otherwise, we simply have the word of man that is supposed to be the word of God. Most of the time, given the corruptibility of human nature, I remain very skeptical when someone claims to know God's will.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>All this to say we have basic assumptions... you mean like a faith in something? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You seem to be saying that an assumption that the world exists is the same level of assumption as saying that God created the world and man, Adam and Eve were the original parents of all mankind, earthquakes happen due to God's wrath, etc. These are very different levels of assumptions. One ( the existence of the world ) is consistent with every experience all humans have ever had. The other ( religious dogma ) lies purely in the realm of people's imaginations - i.e. No one can demonstrate that any of it is true, it is only assumed as true and imagined, not experienced. Basically, the only way we can know the truth ( as opposed to simply guessing it ) is to experience it. Most things we know do come from the experience of others - where I trust scientists, you trust ancient sources written by men and the interpretation of modern men as to what they mean. The very large advantage of trusting scientists is that they show proof and this proof can be demonstrated time and time again.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8094_545_542_1_546_548_550_552_556_557_558_559_560_565_566_567_575_10<br><b>S1:1-  </b>http://www.l4l.org/library/notparas.html Might be worth a look<br><b> S2:1-  </b>They are a known anti-choice web site.

The suggestion is absurd. I wonder how you, as a moral relativist, can even come to the conclusion that somebody is on the wrong side of a moral issue. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Obfuscation, bluster, blather, and bloviation. Why not simply admit up front that your " side " has FAILED in its pathetic attempts at moral suasion, and now you feel you need to resort to the force of law to impose your values on those who do not share them. Welcome to Brave New World!<br><b> S2:2-  </b>This is not at all what has happened. A quick survey of the history reveals that a sufficient number of people thought abortion was wrong to the degree that most state legislatures were persuaded to prohibit abortion in the years prior to Roe v. Wade. It wasn't the other way around. However, it took 7 Supreme Court justices exercising their power illegitimately to establish the right to choice. Therefore, it was the abortion movement that was ( and still has been ) unable to persuade the population at large that they are in the right. This is just a guess, but that may simply be due to the fact that the abortion movement has its roots in the morally bankrupt ground of eugenics and racism. The moral high ground indeed. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>NOT SO!! You have had 36 years to try to amend the US Constitution, and you have failed miserably. If there is such an upswelling of support, you and your ilk could have done it via the state convention route. The fact that you have not even tried shows the intellectual and moral bankruptcy of your position. The people of America, given a taste of choice, will not go back to being dictated to. The South Dakota vote last year provided ample evidence. :) Brown and West Virginia v. Barnette are proof of that. The women of America will never again be shoved to the back of the bus.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It took 77 years to amend the Constitution to prohibit slavery. Does this mean that banning slavery was not the moral thing to do, since it took so long to do so? It took 132 years to amend the Constitution to prohibit the practice of refusing women the franchise on account of their sex. Does this mean that it was not the moral thing to do, since it took so long to do so? So could the abolitionists and the suffragettes. That they were unable to do so means that they were on the wrong side of these respective moral issues? People have tried to amend the Constitution to overturn Roe. The mere fact that they have been unsuccessful does not mean they are wrong on the moral issue. We simply do not know this to be the case simply because the people of America have not been given the opportunity to express their will. The Supreme Court took that choice away from them. So much for getting a taste of choice. Polling data does indicate that the policy generally supported by the American public would not support legal abortion in roughly 90% of the cases that abortion is used today. Ample evidence of what? That the pro-life argument is wrong? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Whatever you do, don't insult the intelligence of those who post here. You and your ilk have had 38 years to spew your propaganda, so please spare us the hearts and flowers. You have had more than enough time to win the argument in this country ; the fact that you have not been able to do so speaks to its bankruptcy. Yes, it did take 70 + years to eliminate slavery, and now you want to overturn that as well and make a woman a slave to her fetus. NICE!!<br><b> S2:4-  </b>This is as ridiculous as saying that after 30 years, the abolitionists had enough time to win the slavery argument in this country ; and the fact that they were unable to do so speaks to the bankruptcy of their cause. Successfully persuading somebody that a fetus is a person entitled to legal protections has absolutely nothing to do with whether the fetus is, in fact, a person entitled to legal protections.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8094_97_96__98_102_103_105_106_107_108_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>babe, Nice rant ; now answer the question. Just in case you forgot, the question was, " If your 14 - year old daughter were impregnated as a result her of being molested by a family member, would you want the government to tell her that she had to bear the child so conceived? " The key here is the government. Still saying " Marxist " as though it were a bad thing, we see. BTW, just how " hefty " a fine are you proposing?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Cappy : Learn to read, I answered your question. As to : I would think that the fines would have to vary from State to State and be reflective of the cost of living index in each area. In an area like NY, something along the lines of $2,500 to the patient and $5,000 to the doctor performing the procedure. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Why you old softie you. You really do think that this small fine is sufficient sanction for, how did you put it again? Oh, yes, I have your words now, " Or, a woman can immorally and ( hopefully soon to be ) illegally choose to find an abortionist to rip the growing life from within her. " Whoever would have thought that the babe would be soft on crime. ;) BTW, it's nice that YOU approve of abortion in the case of rape or incest, but that wasn't the question at all. The question was about how you would react if the government said your 14 - year old granddaughter had to carry the baby to term.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Cappy : Liar. Your question, which you accused me of not answering and which I answered again ANYWAY but now you wish to " edit " was : I replied, AGAIN, that I approve of abortion in the case of rape or incest where a pregnancy has resulted as the result of the woman's / young lady's free will being violated. What is it about my answer that you are unable to grasp? You continue to display your cognitive dissonance by accusing me of having gone " soft " on the abortion issue by recommending fines in the $2500 / $5000 neighborhood and then start bawling about how abortion will only be available to the rich. Which is it Cappy? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The part that is an answer to the question. Once again, it's not relevant what you think the law SHOULD say ; it's what you would say / feel / do in the situation where the law forbids what you approve of - abortion " in the case of rape or incest where a pregnancy has resulted as the result of the woman's / young lady's free will being violated. " Remember that in Sarah Palin's ideal world and in the world of the true believer in the righttofetallife movement, the exemption you seek would be precluded. In that event, would you take her for an " illegal " abortion, knowing that both you and the doctor would be fined a relatively paltry sum? BTW, I love watching you go ballistic when I quote your words back at you, especially those relating to choices and sanctions. That's not twisting a thing, sweetie ; I just quote you and stand back waiting for the explosion.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Cappy : My, you're up early. Oh? Well, the law says a 14 year old can get an abortion without parental consent, whether the pregnancy is the result of rape or not. I think that's disgusting. Speculating as to what the Supreme Court might rule if Roe vs. Wade were to be reintroduced under a McCain / Palin white house is just that, pure speculation. Archangel posted results elsewhere in this forum regarding general opinion on the issue of rape and abortion and I am of the opinion that despite Palin's very fundamental religious beliefs, the vast majority would agree that such a condition is worthy of being an exception. Therefore your question, rephrased 20 ways to Sunday, is moot and ridiculous. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Still refusing to give a direct answer, we see. Tell us, were you the victim of a Jesuitical education? The question still remains, in the situation where, despite the protests, a profetallife Congress passes an antiabortion law with no exceptions - none, nada, bupkus, zilch - and if your 14 - year old granddaughter is impregnated by a molesting family member, will you break the law or encourage her parents to break the law, knowing that the worst penalty is a paltry fine? Yes, it's a hypothetical situation at the present, but the real time profetallife screamers, Palin included, are pushing for just such a law. After all, if we should adopt their idiotic reasoning that " Abortion is Murder ", then how can the nation sit back and permit some murders? BTW, for all you know, I may be up LATE!! :)<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Cappy : Duh! How big of you to admit that instead of calling me a liar for not responding to your constantly morphing question. Just as it's not relevant what you think the law MIGHT be changed to. Good night, Cappy. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Oh but it is. Even as I write, the profetallifers are organizing to create a law and / or Constitutional Amendment to do just that. Here in Colorado the people will vote this November on an Amendment to our Constitution defining a person as existing from the moment of conception. What do you think will happen to abortion in this state if that absurdity should pass?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8656_6_5__9_10_12_32_37_39_41_42_44_45_47_5<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I found myself unable to answer this poll since your wording carries contradictory conotations. Specifically, the word " individual " is often used synonymously with " person ". You may say that you did not intend this poll to be about the beginning of personhood but, by using the term " individual ", you seem to suggest just that. " Individual " is a term which is too laden with meaning to pretend that it is a neutral term. So, the contradictory directions in the poll leave me unable to answer it honestly. To specify my own views, I think that the bodies of unique individuals / people start at conception but that body does not become a person / individual until the beginning of mental existence, which cannot start before roughly the third trimester.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>As predicted, AO... ( as far as your side avoiding the poll ) The second paragraph of your post is more in line with what I was looking for. It's clear that you agree that ( at least ) a person's living body ( a living human individual's body ) begins at and by their " conception. " Assuming that you are confident in your views and opinions, AO.... why are you being so defensive and evasive? ( splitting hairs between human individual's and persons -- do you know any human individuals who are not persons? ) Aren't you the least bit concerned about how that reflects upon your intellectual honesty? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Do you deny that you gave contradictary directions in the poll in saying that it is the start of biological life of " individuals " that you are interested in while claiming that you are not interested in the thoughts about beginning of personhood? When individual = person ( by YOUR very own definition link ), then the contradiction is made clear. Do not blame us for your lack of clarity. It is not the body of an individual until an individual comes into existence. Again, individual = person by the very definition which you linked. Before that body becomes an individual / person by gaining some mental existence, it is just a body with " nobody home " belonging to no one except the mother since she is the only individual in existence at that point in time who has any relevance. Again, how can you claim that I am evasive if it is YOU who purposely made the post unclear. If you do not have specific challenges to the points I made, then the evasiveness is clearly on your side. Again, do you or don't you agree that individual = person and, therefore, your challenge to define the begining of life of an individual without considering that definition is a contradictary nonsensical challenge. Do not blame us for your mistaken logic.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I have been dispatched to a job that will likely go well into the night. But you have already addressed the aspect of my poll that i was seeking from you, AO... You stated that a human being's living body begins at and by their conception. I'll leave you with one questions ( actually intended for a seperate thread and poll ) " do you support the seperation between church and state? " ( I do ) I will respond to some of the rest of this as soon as I can. " work happens " ---- arrrrrgh! <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The wording is very important since it carries many meanings and possible misinterpretations. Therefore, I would reword your bolded statement as " A future but not yet existing human being's living body begins at and by their conception, but the human being themselves does not come into existence until later on in pregnancy, once mental existence is gained. " or, simply, " A future but not yet existing human being's living body begins at and by their conception ". It is very important, in my view, to differentiate between the body before it becomes a human being ( = person = individual ) and the body once it gains mental existence, at which point it is a human being. I will not agree to any statements of my opinion that do not make that point clear. Yes, I support the separation of church and state. I am also glad to hear that you do as well since that eliminates one potential point of contention.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>-- Post 31 Wait a minute, there! In post #12 you posted ; You can't have it both ways AO. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>There is no inconsistency. As you quoted from me, I said : "" A future but not yet existing human being's living body begins at and by their conception,.... " That means that their body - i.e. the body that will eventually become them - starts at conception but the human being only comes into existence later. How else did you interpret " future but not yet existing "? Therefore, your rephrasing of my views : was misleading since, in my view, it is not the life of a human ( i.e. person ) that starts at conception but the life of the body that will become them but is not them yet - big difference. Don't blame me if you are misinterpreting my stance. Please do read my wording and understand it - do not ignore it.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Ok, AO, we seem to be chasing each other around in circles... let me try another approach. I know and have known all along that you do not agree that a " person's " life begins at and by their conception. As, it's clear from your posts that you see a " person " as something more than just an organism that just happens to be of the " human " species. I get it. But my questions are not about trying to convince you ( yet ) that a human zygote, embryo, fetus is a " person. " My goal here is really simple. I am trying to get everyone ( as many people as possible ) to agree on three things. 1 : That mammals ( including human beings ) are biological " organisms. " 2 : That the point of which said organisms become uniquely identifiable ( the point of which their biological life begins ) ( as you indicated it is with horses ) is in fact the moment of " conception. " 3 : That religion, " souls " and all that other hocus pocus has nothing to do with it. Can we or can we not agree on those three things? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I'm glad you do. I was starting to wonder... I can agree with 2 and 3, but 1 needs to have a very important condition. Namely, as it stands, the statement would be interpreted in the way that all it takes to be a human being is for the thing to be a biological organism. I would strongly disagree with that. That may be true for mammals, where I would probably even still use the term " horse " for a living horse body with no brain ( perhaps others interpret more meaning into the word " horse " but I did not get that general impression ). So, I would split 1 into two parts ( and please pay attention to the wording this time ) : 1a : That mammals ( excluding human beings ) are biological " organisms " and can be defined purely on those terms. 1b : That human beings are biological " organisms " but also contain the critical aspect of a mental existence.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Before I attempt a lengthy post addressing this issue once again,... let me ask. " Does it matter to you that the scientific community defines " human beings " differently than you do AO? " <br><b>S1:6-  </b>The very website that you used to define your terms in your opening post defines human being as the following ( from http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/human%20being ) : The first purely biological definition pertains only in the context of purely biological discussions of humans ( ex. the biological differences between humans and animals ), not in the social context we are discussing. The second definition is far more relevant to the abortion debate and that definition defines human being as person - just as I have been using it.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>WE? How many posts do you want me to cite where I specifically said I am ONLY asking about the BIOLOGICAL aspects, AO? You even participated in helping me prove that aspect using horses instead of humans. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>But the topic under discussion is clearly abortion. We are not about to discuss whether humans have gills. It is obvious that one uses the definition that is most relevant to the topic. Even if you start speaking biologically and then change to social, then you cannot logically use any conclusions drawn from the purely biological discussion since any terminology used in biological discussions only would have to be reworded once you change to a social context. I have no doubt that you would then distort our views by quoting us from the biological discussion without taking that change of definitions into account. I will play no part in such a dishonest debate. So, stick to the relevant definition ( i.e. person ) or you lose me as a debater on this thread. Yes, I do mean that as a threat. You can go ahead and keep going with the other debaters and I will just watch with amusement as you try to force a dishonest debate on the others while they, hopefully, continue to foil your efforts.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8656_232_231__233_234_235_236_237_238_239_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Thanks, Jims... This is the type summary / short essay I have been hoping for. I have been away from things ( attending to some family matters ) and I had almost completely missed this one. I don't know how anyone could possibly disagree with this point of view in any way. It will be interesting to read the responses to it,... which I am doing now. Thanks! And welcome!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>YOU may not ".. know how anyone could possibly disagree with this point of view in any way.

None of us will try to force our " correct " answer on you, just as long as you do not try to force your " correct " answer on any of us. Deal? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The only force ( power ) I have is in my ability to observe and to communicate those observations to others. The Constitution says what it says ( 1 st. amendment right to speak, assemble and petition the government included ) The biological facts surrounding human reproduction are what they are and the values that we as a society are willing to place upon all of it is ever shifting. In the end, someone's values will be reflected in our laws. Be it yours, mine or someone elses. Rather than seeing it as one persons views being forced upon another,... I see it as a reflection of the values of the people as a whole. Values that we are all free to challenge, discuss and petition for and against equally under the 1st. Amendment. I'll not make any " deals " which run contrary to my 1st. Amendment rights.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Interesting response. I like the thinking here. If you are saying that each person must find her / his own truth, I could not agree more. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I'm saying a little bit more than that. Yes, I agree that all people must be free to seek their own truths in life. But, no-one has the right to infringe upon the rights of others in their quests for their truth, convienience or anything else. So, it's not quite as simple as you would like it to be.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Exactly so!! :) Therefore, there should be no law whatsoever regarding a woman's right to choose whether or not to take her pregnancy to term. If the profetallifers are correct, moral persuasion should suffice ; if not, they have lost the battle in the marketplace of metaphysical concepts. Establishing law in the are is symbolic of their loss in the clash of ideas. As Richard Cardinal Cushing, John F. Kennedy's confessor once said, " Any faith which needs the force of law to enforce its tenets is not worthy of the name. " <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I see,.. so you must agree that Roe v. Wade is un-Constitutional law,.... You just think it's un-constitutional because it doesn't give a woman full control over whether or not she wants to carry to term. Thanks for holding true to your positions, Chester. The contrast and clarity you are lending to this issue is priceless!<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Not at all. RvW was a masterpiece of judicial restarint. If you have read it, you know this. Mr. Justice Blackmun went out of his way to say that the Government will not be put in the position of picking and choosing among the varying metaphysical answers to the question of the beginning of life and therefore leaves the question in the hands of each pregnant woman to choose the answer that is most congruent with her own answer to the question. Did the decision go far enough? No, but it's a good starting point. It was about as far as the Court felt it needed to go in 1973. I would as strongly oppose a law or decision which requires abortion as I do one which would outlaw it. The government which today may prohibit abortion may well be the same government which tomorrow will require it. The government which claims to power to do either violates human rights. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Yet, when we live under a Constitution which states that a " person's " rights can not be denied except by due process,... it is inevitable that someone's definition of when a " persons " life begins will have to prevail,... incidently, I disagree with your take on the " metaphysical " aspects. The one thing we all have in common as " human beings " is our biology,... The logic would follow that a biological " persons " rights should begin when their biological life does. the metaphysics.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8656_91_89__93_95_96_97_99_101_108_109_110_111_113_114_115_116_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Why is the right to terminate a brain dead coma patient given to the next of kin?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I thought that being " brain dead " means they are already dead.

" This thread is NOT about when " personhood " begins " it is about when a human individual's life begins BIOLOGICALLY. Take your " when a person becomes a person " comments to another thread. They are NOT germane to this debate. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Really? And what of this? http://www.4forums.com/political/sci...tml#post345652 That thread isn't about when personhood begins either. What a piece of work you are. Now I'm really done.<br><b> S2:8-  </b>In the context of this thread, as it IS germane to this deiscussion, that quote is about CONCEPTION being the moment that a persons " aging process " begins,... NOT about when their " person-hood " begins. READ IT CLOSELY.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-6328_3_2__8_10_11_15_18_19_21_26_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Yes, that is generally the main debate, because the fetus has not done anything to deserve to get aborted. Yes, she does. But, she has had sex, and thus as a consequence, should carry the baby. Then if she does not want the baby, she should put it up for adoption. So it can go to a family who desperately wants a baby.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>And the mother has not done anything to be forced to give birth. So sex is only a privelage for those who can phisically give birth? Abortion is not Black and White as you are trying to paint it to be. It's much more complicated. Having a baby, even giving it up, causes a lot of emotional and phisical pain, and most people just cant have babys. They cannot care for it, and they cannot bear to be thinking that their child is out there somewhere. As I have said before, this is much more complicated than you think. Abortion should always be availible in the first and maybe second trimester, so that women wont have to live the rest of their life in fear and abstinence because they cannot support a baby. This is an interesting article : http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15173072/site/newsweek/ I would suggest reading it, just to get a better Idea of our position. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Why do I think that she has inherent value? Because she's a person. Since when is having sex not doing anything? Sex is something, therefore having sex, is doing something. In other threads, I've said that it isn't black and white. For those who can not physically give birth ( those who it would kill or seriously hurt ), I support abortion for. And you think that killing your baby doesn't cause any emotional and / or physical pain?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Glad you figured that part out. Sex is a norman part of a healthy relationship. What about those who cannot emotionally or financially support a Baby. What if I told you you were pregnant right now ( lets just assume you're a girl ), and that abortion was illegal. It would suck, your future would be ruined, and you probably wouldn't be able to lead a normal life again. You have no Idea what women go through when they're pregnant. Much less so if any. There is no post-abortive psycosis, or whatever. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yes, but it also has consequences. I don't know, you may not have heard of this new thing, it's called adoption. Right now, you are assuming. And, as I told georged in another thread a minute ago, don't assume, as you make an XXX out of u and me. So, back to what you said, how do you know that I don't have a 16 year old pregnant sister / friend / other? You said it would suck. Yes, it would suck a little bit, but I decided to have sex, fully knowing the consequences, and now I would have to deal with it. Actually yes, I could live a normal life. I could continue to go to school, give birth to the baby, and then give the baby up for adoption. It would be hard, yes, but possible. I'm sorry, I was refering to those selective people who have a conseince.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No, thats what we have abortion for. Most women can't handle adoption, next... You are painting this as such a black and white issue. You cant just not have sex. You cant just put the baby up for adoption. Many women can become emotionally unstable and maybe even hurt someone else or themselves after giving birth. Its not black and white. Abortion is the only option for most women, and taking that option away would not only be morally wrong, it would be downwright primitive. We dont need extra babys. Unwanted children means poverty and crime, we don't need all of these unwanted children. What would be the point of having them? There are waay too many children no one gives a XXXX about in this world. Have you read that article that I posted yet? I think you might find it interesting. After having a baby, most people arent worrying about their conscience. Even when they're pregnant, they whole lifestyle is in danger. Most women cant have a baby because they cannot emotionally and financially support it, therefore most of them must have an abortion, and many of them feel sad about that. As I said before, READ THAT ARTICLE! <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Your statistics are useless as they don't concern babies. As babies don't go to foster care. There are people on one to two / three year WAITING lists to adopt a baby. Also, I don't understand why killing your baby would cause less emotional pain, as opposed to giveing it to a loving family. Why? Are we that much of animals, that we can't control ourselves? Is it physically impossible to be celibate?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Frankly, im not concerned with a fetus at the moment. Im concerned with the living human being, who feels pain and sorrow, who's life you are about to throw away if you criminalize abortion. You still havent answered my question, why do we need all of these extra unwanted babys? And I also refer you to the quote I posted before. Have you had sex before? I havent, but it is foolish of you to make these assumptions. Sex is part of a healthy relationship and life, and no one will live in abstinence just because they have a chance of having a baby. That's what abortion is for. I refer you to my signature, why do you feel that the government should seize women's reproductive rights and take away their personal choice and freedom? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Well that's your problem, because I am. So just because they're unwanted, doesn't mean that they don't deserve to live? What if one of those aborted babies, may have been the person who discovered the cure for cancer? Have you ever thought of that?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>" If your morals or your religion are getting in the way of your politics, you're not helping anyone. We don't have civil rights so we can be politically correct. We have civil rights so we can be different and offensive. " - madmike, 2/18/04 What if the woman who was forced to have babys discovered the cure for cancer, but couldn't pursue her dreams because she had to care for her children. They don't deserve to live if they are living inside of another, sucking up all of their resources, and causing them emotional pain and suffering. Actually, Its up to the mother. The mother knows the circumstances best, you do not. Therefore, she must make the descision for the child, not you, not the government.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-2779_107_81__108_109_112_113_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I agree, If you choose to have sex you know you might get pregnant... one also knows the things that go along with pregnancy. However, by having abortion people don't really care about having safe sex or no sex because they can always kill off the baby if needed. If one didn't have sex until they wanted children, or had safe sex, then we could reduce abortions by like 90% or something. Time to take responsibility for ones actions.... have sex and get pregnant then take care of your child. Why does a dad have to give up his resources for the child with child support? That doesn't seem fair... maybe they didnt want the kid... does that give them the right to not take care of it?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>BLAH BLAH BLAH Not a valid argument from you. Your policy for pregnant women applies accross the board - her ppregnancy - her responsibility - her consent not required, so your preaching responsibilty rings really, really hollow. Nobody has to be a parent - safe haven laws, adoption, signing away parental rights, etc. Plus this is cute. Have you noted the stats on dead beat dads? Every woman I know who has been awarded child support has trouble getting it, if they get it at all. I was awarded 25% of my ex-husband's income in child support. Never seen one thin dime. Doesn't call or write neither. That's OK - he be a big booger of a loser and we got someone better, now. But really, get a reality check. Statistically speaking it's not the moms who aren't pulling through in the world of parents. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>??? Not a valid arguement why? I just was stating two things there.. 1 ) having abortion legal may actually lead to an increase in abortions 2 ) having sex only when you want children would lead to a decrease in abortions. this seems pretty logical Two your second point... maybe we should do more about dead beat dads. ------- Once again with the kidney thing... you look at it the wrong way... there is not much of a comparison. If you have a kidney disease that requires another kidney this is by no means my fault or from anything I have done. I am not killing this man... he is being killed by a disease. In this case I have a choice to help this man live. Lets look at abortion, The women has the kid in her. She decides to get it killed. This is directly killing the baby... you are the reason the baby dies... in the case of the kidney man... the disease is. Does that make sense now?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It's the " if you are gonna have sex you have to be ready to accept the consequences ' argument I do not buy from you, because you don't make exceptions for rape victims. Responsibility and consent in sex are irrelevant to you since you feel that ANY pregnancy that a woman is faced with is her responsibility period. Drop them off something tall? I am gonna beat you with the stupid stick ( this is what I tell my son when he frustrates me ). Nothing seems to happen in the woman's world to you except the sex act and conception. You don't see another matter. " She just decides to kill it... la la la. " It's so insulting. She is not picking out a freaking hand bag. SHE HAS REASONS. Plus it is getting danged tedious watching the men on this board talk about pregnancy like it an't no big deal. Hate to break it to you all - you DO NOT KNOW. Nor can you. ( And being supportive while the wife was pregnant does not qualify as a pregnancy. ) I am not saying this to say you shouldn't have a voice - but you all trivialize women and pregnancy. It makes me want to kick you. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I thought we already established that were not talking about rape here? We are just talking about " normal " cases. And in this case when you have sex you are erady to accept the consequences. You still don't get the money from them, but I would be sure to look the other way if this were to happen :p I dont understand this as it relates to what were talking about ( donating a kidney or something ). We aren't talking about what a women does in her life other than if she is pregnant and getting an abortion You can kick me all you want, however, I can take it. The unborn can't live when one kills it. You are right, I will never know how a pregnancy feels but this doesn't matter. If I were a women would my opinion be more valid? There are a lot of women out there that agree with what I do. Once again this is not a man vs women debate and I feel that many think it is. I think I am finding some common reasons for common pro-choice beliefs.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It's relevant. nIf your opinion is that all pregnancy MUST be continued rgardless of the woman's resposnibility or consent - then preaching responsibilty rings hollow.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-4309_196_194__197_198_200_202_205_207_208_209_210_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>1. life begins at conception. 2. a 6 - celled zygote is a human. 3. abortion is the act of killing a human. the issue about abortion is not whether its killing a human, but whether it should be considered immoral and illegal. i see no reason to consider abortion any more immoral than masturbation, menstruation or sex with contraceptives, and i've given reason, which i can reproduce on demand. there is no way abortion can be legally considered murder, since an unborn baby has no legal rights, also for reasons i've previously given so abortion is neither immoral nor illegal<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Unkerpaulie is a murderer and has no moral conscience according to what he has written above. - theo <br><b>S1:2-  </b>care to elaborate? or are all your arguments made of baseless and unsupported presumptions<br><b> S2:2-  </b>What do I need to elaborate on?

I also didn't say that killing a human being was acceptable. In fact my defense of the developing human being shows I have a moral conscience and also shows that I do not desire to support abortion which is murder. A sperm or egg by itself is not a human being and will not develop into one and therefore if one should die it is not murder. - theo <br><b>S1:5-  </b>i said a sperm and egg PAIR, not a sperm by itself. a sperm / egg pair can develop into a human, if allowed to fuse. by denying the fusion of the sperm with the egg, and furthermore by killing the sperm and the egg, you are killing the human before it has a chance to be concieved. you are killing the conponents that the human is made of, aborting its life at a stage earlier than conception. you remind me of someone that used to post here... i am asking you bluntly : are you more moral than me? your disregard for the human in its earliest stage of development : the moment before the cells are fused, undermines your claims of having moral conscience. you support contraception, which is the act of killing unfused sperm and egg pairs. a sperm cell is a living thing, and so is an ovum. when fused they begin a new living thing which grows into a baby. when unfused, they still contain everything needed to create a new living thing which turns into a baby. please explain how killing an unfused sperm / ovum pair is morally better than killing a fused ovum / sperm pair<br><b> S2:5-  </b>You know it erks me to spend alot of time with this ridiculous rehtoric with many of you and so sometimes I just like to play these word games back at you guys to give you some of your own medicine. To answer you bluntly, I am not more moral than you. I'm a sinner and you are as well. However, I do not subscribe to the belief of murdering the joined sperm & egg which is a human being. I've already explained the difference between the egg and sperm by itself. Read above. - theo <br><b>S1:6-  </b>thanks for not beating around the bush. i would just like to point out your condescending tone in accusing me of being a murderer and having no moral conscience. my point is that you have no right to be so judgemental to anyone that supports the choice of abortion, because abortion is no more the act of killing an unborn baby than is contraception. abortion is an alternative form of contraception, although you may not want to look at it that way. the purpose of abortion is to allow people to have sex without becoming parents. this entails destroying the cells that would otherwise develop into a baby. the purpose of contraception is to allow people to have sex without becoming parents. this entails destroying the cells that would otherwise develop into a baby. your view, that it is ok to destroy the material that babies are made of via contraception, yet morally bankrupt to destroy the material that babies are made of via abortion, makes no sense to me, but that is your view and i will leave it as that. however, by what i just said, and by your own admission, you have no right to make judgements about anybody's morality, so please refrain from doing so</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3617_57_50__71_73_92_101_106_111_4<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I've become somewhat more anti-abortion in the past few months as a result of my own experiences. However, I am not interested in limiting women's choices. In trying to put myself in the shoes of a woman who was raped I just can't imagine what it would feel like to be pregnant as a result of the rape, not want to stay pregnant, but forced to all the same. Can you imagine walking around, everyone happily dancing around at the sight of your extended abdomen asking questions? " When is the baby due? Boy or girl? Are you excited / nervous? Midwife or hospital? Epidural or natural? Is the father nervous? " I wouldn't want to tell anyone I was raped. It's a very personal, violating act that you might not want everyone to know about. Things become awkward. People act differently. What if you are married / in a relationship? How is your spouse / partner going to feel about you carrying another's child-a daily reminder of the violence that occurred to their loved one? What a horrible, terrible experience. I know that pregnancy is not permanent, but I would not wish this on anyone. I know the fetus is innocent. So is the woman. Men suck. :)<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yeah but all of those are personal things that you don't want to happen to you. These are all WANTS. And honestly, a want doesn't come before a need and killing the child because of ones wants is selfish. If someone rapes you, they have commited a wrong against you and in many ways " killed " a part of you and of course the women feels violated... but does this justify you doing a wrong to someone innocent? Would you kill your neighbor if some stranger robbed you because you wanted to be safer by having no one near you? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>em   pa   thy : Identification with and understanding of another's situation, feelings, and motives. Look into yourself and see if this is inside. While you're in there, think about what you just said. Specifically, how women post-rape have selfish feelings about wanting to get rid of their undeserved pregnancy.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>you assume I know nothing about rape.... we'll leave it at that. This statement is still ironic though. I don't see any empathy for the child. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You're right ; since you're a man I assume you have no firsthand knowledge of being a victim of rape. I have no empathy for the " child ". Early enough, it has no thoughts, feelings, etc. I value a grown, breathing, and self-sustaining woman who has time invested in her life more than a fetus. It's like triage ; which would you save first?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I asked you to leave it alone See, I don't discriminate against any person so I can't choose one life over another. Everytime someone does discriminate history has shown them to be wrong.... slavery and jews come to mind but looking further back in history this still holds try. Your biased it purely based on stage of development and this makes it wrong. Do you believe a 1 yr old is less deserving to live then a 90 year old because the 90 yr old has more " time invested " in their life? most cases their is only one life that can be saved. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>No, you didn't. You said, " We'll leave it at that. " And as this is a rape topic, and I meant no animosity, I was only explaining that as you are a man, and from what I understand the majority of men do not understand what rape is like. Sorry if I offend. But you do discriminate against people. You have decided that your opinions on abortion should be forced onto women you've never met. And... not to be picky, but you said " person " and whether or not a fetus is a person can be debated. Not that I want to get into that! :) Yes, my bias is stage of development b / c a young fetus has no essential organs for life. [ I am not supportive of late term abortions. ]<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Discrimination would imply that I wish to hold different standards for people. I think everyone has the right to live... therefore no discrimination. Pro-choicers believe that some can live and some shouldn't based on nothing more than a random stage of development point. I guess you could say I discriminate by applying the right to life to only humans but that doesn't seem like a strong case you could make.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3617_102_100__113_119_123_124_126_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>But jimmy, aren't we debating in a thread specifically dedicated to pregnancies that result from rape? In answer to your rock climbing question : Yes. By all means pry my grip loose and send me to my death, if that is your choice. In return, I pose another question. You and I are rock climbing. I have an accident and I fall, and manage to grip your leg. You decide to let me fall. Should you be charged with murder? Your position seems to be either : By consenting to sex, you consent to be pregnant since you acknowledge that pregnancy can result from sex, even if the odds are less than one in ten thousand. Having consented to the pregnancy, the woman cannot then change her mind on the issue and take action to become not pregnant. OR : All actions that result in a loss of life ( as abortion does ) should be made illegal. This would obviously not include the state sanctioned killings we already have, but would include things like the rock climbing scenario, or giving aid to a random injured person on the street. Or is there another position I have missed?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>If you wanted the person to fall knowing they would die then yes it is murder in my book. I am going to use a similiar real case scenario here... 3 people, a boy and 2 grown men, got stranded out on a boat in the middle of Ocean ( In England ).. They were out there for some 2 weeks with no food or water. The boat was finally rescued but the boy was not on the boat. The two men said that the boy was near death so they decided to eat him so the others could survive. It was very clear the boy would have died because of his age and weight at the time. It is also clear that when out on a boat that long people become crazy. They were arrested for murder. Should they be convicted? Murder was defined at the time as " The killing of a person without authority from the government " ( or something along those lines ). I know the result and will post it after some thoughts. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>But why should the person to whose leg I am clinging be required by law to attempt to rescue me? Especially when a rescue attempt may place their own safety in jeopardy. Interesting. If eating the boy could be proven to have saved their lives, then I dont think they should be convicted. However, the story isn't really analogous to abortion. A better analogy would be : You find a stowaway on your boat. You toss him over the side, and he drowns. Should you be charged with murder?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I don't that was the question. You never said the mans lift was endangered you just said they let him fall. This would be murder... Just like if you let someone with a gun kill someone else you are responsible finding an exact match is difficult but this is a famous case taught in many law classes. The 2 men were convicted on murder but were pardoned by the Queen. The reason they were convicted was because they law clearly states what murder is and thus they had to be convicted. Eating the boy didn't save the boys life and he never gave consent to it. By saying it was ok you support MAKING someone else die for the saving of another. Some choice. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Indeed. But who is to say how lifting me might place someone else in danger? In keeping with the rock climbing example, they might have to let go with one hand, and change their position on the rock face. This might be dangerous. I wouldn't expect someone to try and rescue me if they thought it might be dangerous. And I wouldn't support a law that forced people to attempt to save others at risk to themselves. Ah, but you aren't held responsible in that case. If you and a friend are walking down the street and are accosted by an armed robber, and he threatens you both then shoots your friend, you are most certainly not responsible for your friends death. No one would expect you to attempt to fight an armed mugger. Fair enough. Interesting precedent. It's not a choice all people can live easily with. Kill or die. But it is supported by law these days ( at least in terms of self defense ) to kill someone to preserve your own life or safety, where the act of killing is deemed to be a reasonable and proportionate use of force. But we're getting way off topic with this.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I think you are getting a little out of the example. The example won't work if we talk about it as a saving measure. If I don't pick up a knife and stab my neighbor, i'm not saving his life, i'm just not killing him. Having a child is the same way in that you are not saving a life that was in danger. You aren't letting your friend be killed though. If you said " shoot my friend dead right now ", then that is murder. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I understand where you are coming from here. No arguments. The rock climbing analogy works like this : Two people climbing the rock face = The baby living inside the mother. One falls, and manages to cling to the others leg = The baby depends 100% on the mother for life. The person whose leg is being clung to decides not to let the other person hang on, and lets them fall to their death = The mother decides to not let the baby use her body, and lets the baby die. In neither instance would I support a law mandating that a person be required to provide care for someone against their will. Depending on how greatly sayng that affected the decision of the shooter to pull the trigger, then yes I suppose you could be held accountable.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3617_93_85__95_96_98_104_107_108_109_110_115_120_8<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The fact is that the foetus was put in the position by the one who wants the abortion, how many deaths to humans have to face so their mothers can enjoy sex? What the hell are you talking about? It is quite simple, a woman chooses to have sex knowing that it can cause here to be pregnant whether she uses all the contraceptives in the world, yet at the point of pregnancy she demands the right to kill another human, that is wrong, especially since pro-choice justify themselves on the grounds that they say they should have choice, the choice to be pregnant or not has always existed and always will, abstinence.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So in summary ( I want to make sure I understand ) you say, " Don't want to get pregnant? Don't have sex. " My response? " Don't like abortion, don't get one! " Let the ones who get abortions deal with the consequences. Keep your nose out of uteri's belonging to women you've never met. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Did you ask the foetus if they wanted to be aborted? No, so stay out of their business. Sorry but your very weak philosophy has just crumbled.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>( In keeping with this thread my response is thus : ) Did you ask the woman if she wanted to be raped? No? Oh. Well, I guess she should just continue to suffer and that's too bad. No one cares about her. She should've just kept her legs closed. Oh, wait, she couldn't ; she was forced. Still too bad for her ; she needs to suck up the consequences of her... oh, no, they weren't her actions. Hmm. I suppose women are just supposed to deal with it ; they are baby-making machines whose lives are secondary to that of a fetus. ( In a generalized way ( the absense of the rape scenario ) I would respond : ) You can't ask the fetus. In the absense of it having even a mind you must succumb to the decisions of those who are responsible for it. You better be a vegetarian. Otherwise you're a hypocrite, and there's no arguing that. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So you justify abortion even though out 46 000 000 abortions less then 500 are a consequence of rape, and not only that but you remedy the rape case by killing the innocent foetus? Their are 3 individuals involved here, the rapist, the woman and the foetus, do you give the rapist a death sentence? So why hand one to the son or daughter of the mother? Is there a way to keep them all alive? Yes. Can the mother give her child up for adoption if she chooses? Yes. Your theory is weak, sly and of hate and death. Mine is compassionate and just and no one dies. I eat meat, of loads of it, since I have the teeth designed for eating meat, that is natural as is child birth, natural is good, nothing hypocritical here. You make some silly comments.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The topic is rape. I don't know what the numbers are, and that's not what I'm debating. I will respect your opinions. I can see both sides, although I disagree with one of them. Killing innocents just so you can eat them is not natural. A cow, pig, horse, dog, cat, rat all have functioning hearts, brains, with emotions and feelings. Even if eating animals is in our design, it does not mean that we cannot overcome it. There are plenty of other foods to eat that will give you the nutritional resources your body needs. I'm sorry to go off topic. It is a hypocrisy, though. How can you value fetal life more so that any other? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>But they are not human, so tough, I will scoff the lot, ummmmm.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>What do animals lack or have that make them okay to dine on?

I can't wait!<br><b> S2:6-  </b>And you said I say silly things! :) Spirituality doesn't necessarily equate to " religion " nor have anything to do with " the lord " and " church " et cetera. This is a very limited idea of what spirituality is. Again, it is very egoistic to assume that we have any concept of the way other creatures think.

It isn't a moral right. It is the same as murder <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I really don't see how? Well obviously we disagree on whats moral and what isn't. I don't even see abortion as a moral issue, it's a mdical issue IMO. It's pointless to discuss the moral standing of a non-sentient non-sapient human as it is to pray and worship a non-sentient and non-sapient God. The very fact we disagree on the moral / value status of a fetus suggests that the moral / value status of a fetus is subjective. You think abortion is immoral don't have one, simply said. :)<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I really hope you don't actually attend church and believe in the Christian God... well, perhaps saying don't attend is a bad word but I mean hold those views and attend church. The Bible says nothing about a human having to be sentient or sapient to be one of God's children. To Him we are all non-sentient and non-sapient. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Well thats an odd thing for another christian to say! lol! Actually I attend UCC. I am really starting to think you don't understand those terms. Man needs a mind to interact with God, this is why humans are above all other creatures because we have the capacity to know and interact with God. We have sentience and sapience.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I don't recall ever telling you I was a Christian. Nevertheless, atleast quote my entire thought as oppose to limiting it just to the first part ;) You don't need a mind... just a spirit. Your " mind " is gone when you die but you can still communicate with God. Either you believe we just don't exist when we die ( thus making God rather worthless ) or you think God just removes your brain and takes it up too. When God said " I know you before you were born " I wonder what you think He knew? I wonder if you think Jesus was not God for 5 - 9 months? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>When the bible uses the term ( soul ) or spirit in most cases the term is reffering TO the mind. God knows past / present and future all at the same time, and no I do not believe Jesus was divine.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Oh right... jewish... Well, we are working on different playing fields then ;) I disagree that soul and spirit refer to " the mind ".

I, myself, have come to the conclusion that abortions hurt much more than they heal. Not just phsyically ( Side effects can occure months afterward ) but psychologically as well. Guilt, depression, so forth. In my view, abortion is murder, one way or the other and rare extreme cases don't justify its legality. Even the rape victim gets a better chance than the baby does. They're at least alive while they kill their baby. That in itself will eat at the person for years until they find some way of forgiving themselves. I believe these testimonies to be real, and I feel sorry for those victims who feel obligated because of family relations ' repuations to kill their own child. It really is sad.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I guess that is your opinion, so if you ever get raped don't get an abortion. The point is, is that it is a choice and not yours. If a women ( girl ) is molested or raped and doesn't feel comfortable keeping the baby who are you to decide that for them? Personally if I were raped and became pregnant I WOULD NOT keep the fetus, if someone else thought differently and they decided to keep a rape fetus more power to them, but don't expect everbody to feel the same as you do. The best person to make that choice is the one that has been through the rape / incest and has to live with the outcome. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Do I have tell you exactly how many rape / incest victims are the ones who decide an abortion is neccessary? How many of them need to have counseling years afterwards because they had the abortion, not because they were a rape / incest victim? There are very few if any girls in the U.S. that would have an abortion after an experience like that. It's the family and relations that force them into it in order to keep the matter hush-hush. No doubt some of those reasons seem good, but abortion is an incorrect solution. The help a victim should get is a hug, some tears and comforting words so that they view their future life in a positive light. Instead, they bury them in words of " GET AN ABORTION, YOU'LL FEEL BETTER LATER ". Yeah right. Oh, I think I'll add that only 1% of abortions performed yearly are for rape / incest cases. And some years it may even drop lower than that. Should we keep abortion legal for just that 1%?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>First of all rape is one of the most under-reported crimes so it makes sense that abortion due to rape / incest is also under-reported so that makes your assumptions and numbers off. But of course you are missing the whole point. You are not the one being raped so it isn't YOUR choice. I don't need you making choices for me or telling me what is and isn't good for my emotional health. If one gets raped and DOES NOT want to be pregnant who are you tell them they have to be? Abortion should be legal for everybody who wants one not just rape / incest victims, for the simple reason that no human being has the right to substain life by using the body of another why should a fetus have more rights than actual persons? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It has equal rights. The rape / incest victim does not have to DIE, she has to live with a pregnancy, and that should not stand in the way of the baby's right to live. And you should research rape / incest abortion cases more thoroughly, you're knowledge of their frequency seems kind of small considering your post.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I am sorry I think you misunderstood me. Even IF a ftus somehow has a right to life, they STILL do not have a right to that life if it means using anothers body without consent. No person has that right. You may find abortion immoral. Thats your opinion, but to make abortion illegal is granting more rights to a fetus that any other actual person has. I have a * right to life*but that doesn't grant me the right to hook up to your blood supply if I need a 24 hour 7 day a week blood transfusion without your consent. Even if not doing so results in my death. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>What are you talking about?!? A fetus doesn't take blood from the Mother. And I would challenge you to show me a BORNchild in the world that didn't require physical assistance ( from anybody ) to survive. A born-child can't live without physical help, so I guess if a family doesn't want to support their child anymore, they can just boot them out and say they don't have the right to live off of them.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I see you * mis - understand* me AGAIN. First of all, a mother isn't obligated thats what adoption and orphanges are for. If my child has a rare kidney disorder and needs a kidney that only I can provide, I am STILL not obligated by law to give my child one of my kidneys. A born child doesn't need to bodily live off another for survival BTW. One more time NO BORN PERSON HAS THE RIGHT TO LIVE OFF THE BODILY PERSON ( ORGANS, BLOOD ) OF ANOTHER WITHOUT CONSENT. Removing a fetus from my bodily person which results in the death of the fetus is an expression of my right to my bodily person. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>You still have to prove that a living fetus has less rights than you. You also have to remember that you got the fetus through consensual sex, and that the pregnancy is something you must deal with if you really cared about your rights to your own body. A fetus is not a part of your body, and if you didn't want it, you had no business having voluntary sex. You're right to your body and its desires should not stand in the way of a fetus's right to live.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>It doesn't matter, even IF a fetus has the same rights as me it STILL doesn't have MORE rights than me. And how I got the fetus is irrelevant. I think you misunderstand the term * right-to - life* sure everybody has the right to life but not at the exspense of someone esles body. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Why's that? Are you now considering yourself more important than the fetus? Oh yes it does, happygrl 35. You can't just have sex whenever you want and have an abortion once a pregnancy comes along. You need to take responsibility and accept the fact that you can't have one without the other.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-4948_12_11__13_14_15_16_17_18_23_24_33_34_35_37_43_44_45_46_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Firstly, the thread title is misleading ; it should have a " can " or " may " in it. Secondly, what is the logical link that an abortion could lead to mental problems? - Wez<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Perhaps you should read the article.... i'm searching for the actual findings. As for a misleading title... It is similiar to the one from the article... you shouldn't judge based on the Title. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I did read the article. Why do you ask? " It was plausible that abortion might trigger mental illness, he said, because it could be a traumatic life event and involve loss - both of which are linked to increased psychological problems. " That's the only statement related to my question. Lots of ifs and buts without strongly linking abortion to " increased psychological problems ". Firstly, it isn't that similar, because article's title includes " linked to mental problems " whereas yours says " hurts " and secondly two wrongs don't make a right. If the article used your title, it would be equally invalid. I didn't judge the article based on the title ; I judged the title based on its factual inaccuracy. - Wez<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well, the article says it is only some evidence and he really just wants there to be more in order to get an accurate reading... but.. If you find the title of my thread misleading I apologize. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It doesn't say why the two appear linked. It's missing ' cause and effect '. NP :). - Wez<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I'm not sure it was to find why the two appeared to be linked... I think it was just finding if there was a link ; however, I haven't read the actual study because I can't find it... although in the Alito Hearings today they added it to the record.. so they got it <br><b>S1:4-  </b>But it didn't really find there was a link. Woman, after an abortion, appear more likely to have mental problems. But, why can't it be linked to reality TV? There is more reality TV on now, than when they had the abortion and weren't depressed. Does this mean reality TV leads to depression? - Wez<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I don't understand what your point is? Are you saying that the scientists didn't come to the correct conclusion? We haven't even read the actual findings since I can't even find it. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>My point is the article doesn't find a connection between abortion and mental problems. It finds that the people asked, after abortion had more mental problems, but it doesn't find that they suffer the problems because of the abortion. They might be suffering the problems for reasons linked to the cause of the abortion. For example if they have an abortion for financial reasons, then after the abortion they'll still be poor, so may be more likely to suffer depression. The study needs to establish that abortions can cause an increase in mental problems first. - Wez<br><b> S2:5-  </b>It did, that was the whole purpose of it. It established the following : yeah it did, that was the point of the findings... once again we don ; t have the exact study to look at though, but what the researchers said they found are clear in the article. Without reading the actual findings you can't say this was a flaw in the findings. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Because someone who has an abortion doesn't want or can't have the baby. If the reason is that they're an alcoholic, incredibly poor, a drug addict or in an abusive relationship then there's a higher chance that they will be depressed later on in life. They're more likely to be depressed because of their lifestyle, not necessarily because they had an abortion. What part of this do you disagree with? The quote provided is an opinion. - Wez<br><b> S2:6-  </b>an opinion of the person doing the research. His opinion is backed by research. I agree that all scientific research is opinion but that seem irrelevant. The part that the abortion played no role. After the abortion depression and other mental illinesses increased. The abortion was still the cause of an increase. The circumstances are irrelevant to one seeing if abortion increases certain mental problems. Once again though, read the study first before you say the findings are wrong... I can't find the study though. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>The research also backs up my opinion. That isn't part of what I said : strawman. Prove it. The depression can be caused by many other factors and you know that full well. What does " the findings " refer to? The statistics or the conclusions? - Wez<br><b> S2:7-  </b>what? this guys research backs up your opinion of what? Maybe I misunderstood you. The research talks about how abortion plays a role in mental health. That is what they did... It is what the article is about. of course... but when you have x level of depression before an abortion and then afterwards it increases, do you think that the person just decided to be more depressed? im not sure what you are asking here. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>That women after an abortion are more likely to suffer mental problems ( for a variety of reasons ). I didn't say it played no role. No it's not. The article says women are more likely to suffer depression after an abortion. Full stop. Nothing more. It doesn't say, for definite, why and as such you can't say for definite that abortion increases the risk of mental problems. Others factors contribute to abortion. A woman who is perfectly happy, can have a child and wants the child won't have an abortion and being a perfectly happy woman is unlikely to suffer depression. A woman who has an abortion obviously has a problem somewhere. Depression form alcoholism, family problems, abusive husbands, poverty etc. doesn't always appear as soon as the problem appears. It can take some time. For example, till after then abortion. - Wez<br><b> S2:8-  </b>I believe he said abortion may lead to more mental problems... You could say that the platletes ( sp ) clogging in your viens is what caused the heart attack and not the 50 Big Macs you ate every week for ten years but you gotta say thats a reason. His findings were to say the " big macs " helped in causing the problem. I didn't say it was the only role. But this was their findings... that abortions may increase mental problems. This says it all : This is all I am trying to say... and what his research says. Ok but the abortion still triggered it like the article suggests. <br><b>S1:9-  </b>Not really as a cause for depression was likely to be there before the abortion took place, hence the fact the abortion was undertaken. You said claimed my argument involved : " The part that the abortion played no role. " In fact it doesn't. Fresh air may cause mental problems as well. They didn't establish that abortion leads to an increased chance of getting mental problems. Yep and fresh air may cause an increase in mental problems as well. hey didn't establish that abortion leads to an increased chance of getting mental problems. The article doesn't actually state that though. - Wez<br><b> S2:9-  </b>I acknowledged that I misunderstood you here. I think I said what I wanted to on the rest of the article... we are just going in circles now.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8582_76_74__77_79_83_84_88_93_94_96_97_98_99_100_104_6<br><b>S1:1-  </b>OK, let's assume for the sake of argument only, that the prosecutions for abortion are on a state-by-state basis. You may choose to ignore settled Constitutional law if you wish in this little fantasy game of yours. Let us further assume that state " A " criminalizes abortion, complete with the Draconian punishment you propose. Let us further assume that neighboring state " B " has no law prohibiting abortion. Will the system you propose prevent women from state " A " from traveling to state " B " to have her abortion? If so, how? The questions will just keep on coming until you are forced to admit the irrationality of your proposal. ;) BTW, have YOU ever drawn a jury from a pool of those summoned? I have.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The system that I propose is a Constitutional amendment, which would clearly address this scenario. And? Though jurisdictions differ as to how they define the crime, this would generally not apply because involuntary manslaughter usually requires proof of recklessness. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Really? What is its text, and how will you get around the Interstate Commerce Clause? And there are limits on peremptory challenges, or have you not heard of Batson v. Kentucky. Plus which, why would any attorney want to set her / himself up for a successful appeal by trying to seat a hanging jury? What will you do when you have used up your peremptories? Do you seriously think any judge will accede to your demand that potential juror " X " be excluded on the basis that he is pro-choice? If you do, please pass the mushrooms. :) Remember, we celebrate in this country the jury nullification that freed John Peter Zenger. Wow, you are getting yourself in deeper and deeper. Not only would you abolish abortion, but now you would restrict women's freedom to travel. Isn't this fun? I'm enjoying playing picador to your Jake LaMotta.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I fail to see how the commerce clause is implicated by an amendment extending the legal protection of life to human beings from the moment of conception. I fail to see how striking a juror because of his views on abortion amounts to striking him because of his race. If you really were a former practicing attorney, I am beginning to see why you no longer are one. I will not do anything. I clearly said that a juror who is pro-choice could exercise his duty to apply the law notwithstanding his personal view. I merely pointed out the use of peremptory challenges to demonstrate that your question was too simplistic. For however many peremptory challenges the jurisdiction allows, neither the state nor the defense need give a reason for striking a juror. You really are a clever one, aren't you? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>People have a Constitutional right to travel across state borders. Do you need a passport and a customs ' inspection to go from New York to Vermont or from Nebraska to Colorado or from Iowa to Minnesota? I rather think not. NEXT!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Actually, this isn't true. But that is neither here nor there because we are not talking about stopping people from crossing borders. And this has nothing to do with anything. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Really? I grew up on the border between New York and Pennsylvania. Are you seriously going to tell this forum that residents of one state may not freely travel to the other ( except, of course, for prisoners and Mann Act violators )? Please cite your sources. At any rate, you are just going to have to deal with the reality that we have a pro-choice President and Congress. Your time has passed, to be replaced by a new paradigm, and you and your ilk will just have to adjust.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No, I am not going to say that. But I will say that their freedom to do so is not protected by the Constitution. The United States Constitution <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Don't play games. You were asked to cite specifics and you failed. Now tell the forum just exactly how your proposed " Amendment " is going to be congruent with Atr. I, Sec. VIII of the Constitution. Wait, I've got it. You will put every pregnant woman in the country into detention for the period of their pregnancies. NICE!!! In so deep you can't get out, aren't you? :(<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I did cite specifics. I cited the Constitution. And if you were to ever read it, you would find that what I have said is true. Now, if the Constitution really does protect interstate travel by individuals, perhaps you could cite precisely where it does so. This makes no sense. You seem to think it possible that a Constitutional Amendment could be unconstitutional. That is an absurdity. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>NO!! I'm not falling into that trap. YOU made the assertion, now YOU prove it. Really, I suspect you will feel differently when the CA Supreme Court finds precisely that vis a vis Prop 8. Perhaps you could post the text and we can see for ourselves, or is this a state secret? Be that as it may, you're getting deeper and deeper into the muck and mire. Why not simply admit that your crusade has failed? You represent the past, and like creatures of the dim, dark past, you and your ilk are becoming extinct. Women will make up their own minds as to their reproductive choices, and that includes the choice of whether or not to continue their pregnancies. We in the pro-choice camp will continue to support them, regardless of the choice they make.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>I didn't make an assertion, you did. And I soundly rebutted it by posting a link to the Constitution, which you are free to read. You will not find any individual right to interstate travel protected therein. It is standard in any debate that the person who is defending the negative ( that would be me ) does not bear the burden of proof, but rather the person trying to establish the positive ( that would be you ). You asserted that an individual had a constitutional right to interstate travel, citing no authority but your own self for that conclusion ; and you will have to forgive me for not simply taking your word for it given the numerous legal errors you have made in the span of just the last 20 or so posts. This is not analogous because there are different provisions in the CA constitution than exist in the federal Constittuion, and only a fool would attempt to allege that those provisions apply to the Federal Constitution, which is the topic of discussion. The text of what? I've met you tit for tat, which, I should point out, is not that difficult of a task. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>The text of your proposed Amendment that will prohibit pregnant women from traveling from restrictive state " A " to permissive state " B " to obtain an abortion. You know, the one which will eliminate the pesky little detail of the freedom of interstate travel. Are you really so tied up in knots that you cannot remember what you posted? Yes, I'm tittering at the tattering your " arguments " have received. Another cry of the dying dinosaur rings through the swamp. BOHICA, Jake.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>No, that is not what it would do. It would, in effect, require all of the states to prohibit abortion. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Where's the text? If you have one, post it or slink away with your tail between your legs.

BTW, in actuality, the Court made the correct decision. Roe v. Wade is a model of judicial restraint. Mr. Justice Blackmun states quite clearly that, in light of the multiple theories about when life begins, that the Court is not going to enshrine one above all the others. Instead, as he said, the choice was to be left to each individual woman. BTW, you just tipped your hand. You truly DO believe that the government is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is. It is a absurd concept, but at least you were forthright enough to tell the forum that you support absurdity. Few before you have had the stones to do so. :( <br><b>S1:2-  </b>1. Appeal to ridicule and probably a forum rules violation. 2. I have a 1st. Amendment right to speak, assemble and to petition the Government for redress... in any case where I disagree with a law.

QUOTE ; " The ethical, legal and social issues raised by the project are numerous and diverse in nature... " In 1965, Dr. Leonard Hayflick discovered the biological mechanics for how a person's aging biologically begins at conception,... but the implications for that finding are only now being applied to the abortion issue. His findings ( that life biologically begins at conception ) were not presented in Roe v. Wade. Someday, a new SCOTUS will get the right case to consider new findings again. 6. Gross Mischaracterization and should be reported as such 7. See #6<br><b> S2:2-  </b>OK, if these are such gross mischaracterizations, then the only possible logical conclusion is that you support the right of a woman to choose the future of her pregnancy. That makes you handle here only one of many choices, even if it is the one you prefer. Sorry, but you can't have it both ways. There are two and only two alternatives ; either the woman has the autonomy to choose the future of her pregnancy, or the nanny state takes that choice from her. Which more accurately sums up your POV? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>This line of questioning is not only known as a " Red Herring " argument. It is also antithetical to the issue of " when does a child's right to their life begin? " A woman's rights do not take place in a vaccuum. Neither do a child's rights, by the way. Nobody's rights rights are as exclusive as you demand in your question.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So then, how a bout a final, definitive statement on your part as a aresponse to the question. For me, the answer is legally, morally, and ethically clear. The rights of an actual person in being, i.e., the pregnant woman, trump the rights of a potential person, i.e., the fetus, every single time. If only any of you profetallifers would be so forthright. Please do not hide behind the smokescreen of attacking my POV ; tell us yours. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>And when you recognize the fact that a human fetus is an actual " person " in the fetal stage of their life,...

As with the killing of Dr. Tiller,... even things which are wrong, illegal and counterproductive to the cause. But that doesn't negate the validity of the cause itself. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>[ QUOTE ] The only thing that gives me pause as to the validity of the pics is the disrespectful treatment they're receiving ( By people who claim to have the utmost respect for them, at that! ) And I believe I gave them proper credit for having brought PROPS along to the abortions they'd scheduled to obtain their material. I can understand your point. However, you've basically hired Glenn Beck to run your ad campaign. Its hard for me to imagine that someone would was a fervent believer would be callous enough to provide citing instructions right with ground up fetus on display. Bad Business!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Bad enough to cause you to turn a blind eye to the killings? I'm not being sarcastic here,... I really want to know if you would use the questionable tactics of a site like the one linked to,... to justify turning a blind eye to the reality of elective abortions. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>No. My beliefs aren't informed by hyperbolic, cynical, hypocritical propaganda. The CBR seems to be a sick group but they'll not effect my beliefs. I wish we lived in a perfect world where no abortions were ever needed. Since that is not the case, we've got to let the person who'd have to carry the baby to term decide how her body. Otherwise, women will not be truly free to set their own destiny.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Interesting take, Cunx. So, how do you reconcile that with the belief ( if you have it ) that one person's rights end where another person's rights begin? Or do you disagree with the idea that no-one has the right to violate the rights of another? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I think we're retilling old ground here. I believe that the woman's rights superseedes that of the fetus. If she doesn't want to carry it, she can't be required to do so.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I actually envy you Cunx. You seem to have it all worked out to where you don't see any injustice in an elective abortion. For the life of me, I can not see how you can defend your position using the Constitution but I guess that's something you don't want to explore any further than we already have. So, why? iI it's all so settled with you and you don't want to have to explain or defend your position ( or provide a basis for your claims ),.... why do you bother engage in these discussion at all? Honestly, If I had your position and was as convinced as you seem to be,... I would get the hell out of here and other threads like it and move on to something else. In fact, that's the most tempting and appealing aspect of your comments! <br><b>S1:6-  </b>[ QUOTE ] I'm glad to be your hero. I don't know how much impetus I'm feeling to defend my position since the Supreme Court and the law of the land seem to agree with me. Again, you keep asking me to explain and ' defend ' my position and I have. My position is that a woman's right to walk into a Doctor and make decisions about her body does not require nor ALLOW us to interpose ourselves into the exam room. She should have the right embryo removed and control her own body. That's my explanation. My defense is US Law. I'm still hear waiting for your answer to my questions, namely... Should we then appoint lawyers to represent the fetuses in cases of rape or incest? If they're constitutionally protected they have the right to due process. What about when the mother's life is at stake? How would that mitigate the constitutional rights of the fetus?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>And when the laws run contrary to the sentiments expressed by ( if not the letter of ) the Constitution? What then? <br><b>S1:7-  </b>Well according to the Supreme Court abortion is constitutional.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>That's the rub, isn't it. The court was far from unanimous and the people have been split on the issue ever since. Not to mention the fact that the court is neither perfect, nor infallible.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-9062_11_10__13_15_52_56_57_70_77_79_81_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>So you have no personal moral objection to it you just choose not to do it. I guess it would be something like having no real problem with eating cake you just never real want to. Ha, that's the best I could come up with :) Some people judge but that has nothing to do with abortion being right or wrong. Seems there is always a disconnect in the arguments of abortion. No one objects to a person choosing what is right for themselves. No one objects to the idea that murdering a person is wrong. The disconnect is that pro-life people feel the unborn is a person and therefore should choose for themselves and thus abortion would be the same thing as if you killed me. So pro-life folks never see it as a one-party problem but as a two-party problem.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Wrong. I do have a personal moral objection to abortion. I just don't attempt to foist my personal morals on others. What they do is their business. Next time an " unborn person " makes a choice... you give me a call. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Sorry, I thought that is what you meant. What is the moral objection? Do you feel it is killing someone?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well, killing an embryo or a fetus, I wouldn't call it killing a " someone ". We feel that if we produce a life, it is our responsibility to take care of it. Balance that with the fact that we would have no problem with having an abortion in the event of pregnancy resulting from rape or grave danger to her health. So am I personally opposed to killing an embryo or fetus simply as a matter of birth control... yes. Am I opposed to others making the choice for themselves... not at all. I have a choice, and I choose no. But I am very glad I have the choice. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I guess I just don't understand why you place value on an embryo or fetus but this is clearly less value than a born person. Do I understand that correctly?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I'm not sure if you do or not. I'm not sure why you think I value a fetus more or less than a " born person ". Can you explain what you mean by that? Basically, my wife and I will not participate in an elective abortion, we simply could not bring ourselves to kill the fetus that will eventually become our child. Aside from that, I could give two hoots about what anyone else wants to do. I view it as a personal decision, and everyone should have the right to decide what is best for themselves, not have their actions dictated to them by others with different beliefs. Remember, pro-choice only means having that option... it does not mean pro-abortion. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Sorry, I'm honestly just trying to understand your position I have no heard it before and perhaps I'm assuming a few things. I'm saying do you value a born person more than an unborn in terms of what rights they are afforded. I'd assume you think I have the same right to life as some homeless guy on the corner... correct? If this is the case than I'd assume the unborn has less rights because you don't support any law to protect the unborn from being killed but you would for me and the homeless guy equally. To me that comes across as different value levels. But you do give two hoots about other people you don't know getting murdered, yes? This too is a personal decision of another ( in many cases ).<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I guess it comes down to the fact that while I see both the fetus and the person synonymous with life, I do not see the fetus synonymous with the person. I don't really look at it as " unborn person " and " born person ". There are people, and there are fetuses. I myself would always choose to allow that fetus to become a person, but some would choose not to. I support other peoples rights to make their own decisions. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Ok, so it is a different value. This is similar to what pets are to people ( not the exact same I understand )... you don't want to see them killed and would protect that but if it came between the person and the pet the person's rights win. This is slightly different because you actually don't have a choice to slaughter your pets... as Michael Vick found out<br><b> S2:5-  </b>No, Vick found out that people don't seem to like it when you take dogs and make them fight to the death for sport. You can however have your pet euthanized in a humane and painless way at almost any vets office. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I was making a joke :)</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-1976_52_50__64_66_67_68_69_70_71_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I don't think I agree.

My point was simply I would be more likely to believe you a " saver of unwanted babies " if you were actively saving one not just proposing that they should be " saved ".<br><b> S2:1-  </b>MY GOD, PLEASE tell me that you hold politicians to this same criteria then!!! I know this is a little off the topic, but it needs to be said... we have Liberal politicians and activists who claim to care for the poor and starving, push for policies to " help " these people, but do little or NOTHING to change the problem themselves, i.e., taking the poor in, giving enough money DIRECTLY from their own pocket to feed a starving family. We Conservatives are considered EVIL because we DON'T push the policies, but rather prefer doing things on our own to help. I expect to get a few laughs from your side on that one, but seems to me if the shoe fits.... Do you consider the Democrats / Liberals saviors of the poor? Seeing my point, no doubt you will say no, but then that wouldn't be consistent with a Liberal way of thinking <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I trust that there are both Conservatives and Liberals giving directly to the " poor ". I don't know how consistently liberal I am but I do not consider Conservatives " evil ". If private donation can be said to have not solved the " problem " since it persists, I don't see any other solution than to have some level of governmental intervention. The fact that no perfect solution has been found does not suggest that all support should be abandoned. I do not subscribe to the conservative notion that everyone can " lift themselves by their bootstraps " given there are many without boots.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well up until he was running for President, Kerry didn't seem to care much at all about charities. But anyway..... Well, considering that trillions have been spent " helping " the poor, I would say that that can be labeled as a HUGE failure. And no doubt not all Conservatives take people into their home, but then again, we don't make that a cornerstone of our beliefs, and Liberals do. And I beg to differ, we all have bootstraps, we just have different levels of motivation <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Do you believe lack of motivation explains why we have the poor?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It's certainly a factor. There have been poor that have made it big, have there not? Are you going to say that they made it on luck alone? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Do you believe that since some poor have " made it big " that it can be inferred that anyone can?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I think everybody has within them an ability to become successful to the point of not being a drain on society <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I agree but that wasn't the question. Conservatives are big on the " rags to riches " mythology and you are talking " rags to thrift store ". IMO veiled contempt for the less fortunate is a cornerstone of conservative idealogy and the reason I cannot be one. It strikes me as a form of " manifest destiny ". If the strong don't seek to protect and uplift the weak then what sort of people are they? I do not share values with these people.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-1976_91_90__93_94_95_96_97_98_5<br><b>S1:1-  </b>We've debated that already, though. You believe the way you believe, and I believe the way I believe. Unless something new is brought to the table, we know where each other stands. Actually, the only opinion I've given you is that I don't believe choosing for hair color. There are many instances I don't believe abortions should be performed, especially cosmetic reasons. Whatever reasons I believe aren't good ones for abortions are just my opinion and have no bearing on whether I believe abortion should be legal. I don't " support " abortion. I am against making it illegal, but I have no love for abortion. I believe it's a necessary choice. Ok. Not my favorite way to debate but I guess I'll give it a go.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Well, that wasn't clear from your posts. I just don't understand though, you believe in a woman's choice, for whatever reasons she feels are important to her, but yet you think it would be wrong for cosmetic reasons? Gender reasons too? Sorry, seems " inconsistent " to say the least <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It would only be inconsistant is I had abortions for those reasons. Others do things I don't approve of all the time. If I don't approve of you owning a gun but I believe in your right to, am I inconsistent? Believing in the right and approving of the action are two different things.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So you are saying if a woman chose to abort her pregnancy based on cosmetic or gender reason, you would support her right to do that? And to further clarify, away from the RIGHTS aspect, you seem to believe it's okay to abort for financial reasons but not for cosmetic / gender reasons? THAT to me is where the inconsistency lies. Forget about the rights part for a second, basing it on your BELIEFS <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I support the right to abort for any reason. My personal reasons would not include cosmetic reasons. If I or my SO were pregnant, we would have to be in dire financial straits to consider abortion. Cosmetics don't necessarily negativly affect us, while a financial burden would. If our circumstances were such that we flatly could not afford an extra expense, then we would consider abortion. It would not be a light decision. Obviously if either of our lives were threatened, or our health seriously impaired we would consider it then as well.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Despite our differences, I don't consider you stupid ( the ARGUMENTS you have are a different story :-P ), so I would have been shocked if you had said differently.... on HERE anyway ;-) There's no truth detector here to say with any certainty that you in FACT think this way, you are smart enough to know that IF you had said differently it would've damaged your argument, so ANYWAY.... We all know how iffy one's financial situation is at any given time. While you are pregnant, things could be a little tight, and the day after you have an abortion you could get a big promotion. Or could be the other way around, you're pregnant and things are going great and boom, the child is born and you lose your job... what then? You really can't see what a weak argument you have, to base that kind of decision on circumstances that can change at the drop of a hat. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I'm not sure what you mean by this It isn't an argument, it's my personal beliefs. If I or my SO got pregnant and decided that we could not afford it, we would consider an abortion. If we decided to keep it and after it was born lost our jobs... we would not and could not change our decision. We had decided we wanted a baby. After it is born we would not want to change our decision, nor could we.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>you said this : and I just meant that IF you had responded differently, it would make the defense of your beliefs more difficult because it would not have been a consistent belief See how legalistic this society has become? You know what I mean, substitute argument for beliefs then if it makes it easier, good Lord. And you couldn't change your decision if you killed the fetus and then hit the lottery the next day either! IF it's such an earth shattering decision like you claim, and since finanial conditions can change for the better or worse at any time, it would make much more sense to be prudent and assume that one's finances DO get better ( afterall, I'm sure many of us are making more money now than we did at 22 or 29 or...) and therefore one would keep the child.

Let's see what you make of the 1791 words of 1A which say " NO LAW ". Are you ready to advocate for the dissemination of kiddie porn, or have the words " NO LAW " changed meaning over time so that they no longer mean not a single, solitary law? BTW, I can think of others who believed in absolutes - Mao, Louis XVI, Bismarck, Stalin, Hitler, Pinochet, Jaruzelski, and Kim Jong-Il. On balance, I think they more than cancel out your list. Be that as it may, there simply is no getting around the fact that profetallifers wish to keep pregnant women in slavery to their fetuses and that they are willing to sacrifice women on the altar of their fetuses.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Aside from the fact that the 1st Amendment applies only to Congress, " the freedom of speech " has never been an absolute. Treason, for instance. In what way? Are you suggesting that those folks did bad things? Such a statement has no meaning if there is no absolute truth. Do you really believe that what Hitler did was just as moral as what Wilberforce did? Do you really believe that exterminating 6 million Jews is just as moral as liberating an entire race from the institution of slavery? There it is again -- slavery to their fetuses. It has already been demonstrated that this is impossible. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Please don't show the entire forum your lack of knowledge of the Constitution by writing drivel such as this. Treason is the only crime defined in the Constitution, in Article 3 to be precise. If you took the time to read it, you would see that it dealt with ACTS, not speech. Besides which, why not tell us just exactly how, in light of the words NO LAW in the First Amendment, speech can be, under your absurd idea that the words of the Constitution, restricted, except by others interpreting those words. Kinda knocks your pet theory into a cocked hat, I would say. You want the words to be unchanging when they support your warped POV, but flexible when they do not. NICE!! Further, the dissemination of kiddie porn IS a Federal crime, so it would seem that all prosecutions by the Federal government must cease forthwith.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, it really doesn't. But what I would really like to know is this : Do you really believe that what Hitler did was just as moral as what Wilberforce did? Do you really believe that exterminating 6 million Jews is just as moral as liberating an entire race from the institution of slavery? i <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Do YOU really believe that to be an intelligent question? BTW, you might want to ask the Ukrainians about why they allied with Hitler. ( Hint : it wasn't because of his Final Solution! ) At any rate, we note that you have once again tried to shift away from a topic you don't want to discuss - your slippery Constitutional interpretation wherein you claim the right to determine which words are to be used as when they were written and which others you choose to modify over time. How about NO LAW in 1A. What new spin will you put on them to deny the right of someone to disseminate kiddie porn? Denying a pregnant woman who wants one of the RIGHT to an abortion in making her a slave to her fetus.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I see you evaded again. The question is plenty intelligent, and is really quite easy, and you are the one who brought up absolutes. So here it is again : Do you really believe that what Hitler did was just as moral as what Wilberforce did? Do you really believe that exterminating 6 million Jews is just as moral as liberating an entire race from the institution of slavery? Using force, locking them up, and other various things provided by law. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You would do this to those whom you label PROSPECTIVE lawbreakers, i.e., those who have not committed a criminal act? Welcome to Burma, North Korea, and Sudan, among others. We would love to know what the " various other things " might be. Well, there goes the original interpretation of 4A, 5A, 6A, and 8A. Not really an originalist are you, except when it suits your purposes? It's fun watching your dearly held theories slowly unravel under scrutiny. Now, what about kiddie porn under 1A? You know, the part that says NO LAW!<br><b> S2:4-  </b>In the United States, solicitation for murder will land one in prison. We punish law breakers, and that is what I am suggesting. Now, maybe you would be willing to speak to this question : Do you really believe that what Hitler did was just as moral as what Wilberforce did? Do you really believe that exterminating 6 million Jews is just as moral as liberating an entire race from the institution of slavery? Yeah, not so much. I have only made the common sense statement that we lock people up against their will all the time for things. If you support locking people up for their crimes, then you, too, support forcing at least some people to do things against their will. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Silly you. Solicitation IS a crime. In the law, solicitation, conspiracy, and attempt are called PRELIMINARY, not PROSPECTIVE criminal acts. You specifically said PROSPECTIVE criminal act. It's only the difference between night and day. For a person who says words in the Constitution have an absolute definition that is fixed for all time, you're quite sloppy in your definitions. Now, want to explain how the words NO LAW in 1a are an absolute bar to prosecutions for disseminating kiddie porn. Under your " originalist " interpretation, not only would it not be a PROSPECTIVE crime, it would not be criminal at all. If you want to " change the law ", you first need to understand it.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-2585_17_16__21_26_31_32_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Not to mention that if it goes wrong, could hurt the child or teenager too.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Daewoo, The girl estimated she was four months pregnant No, the rationale is that no-one, not even parents, can force anyone to continue to be pregnant against their will. Parental guidance is encouraged, but in no way should they make the decision about what a girl, even their daughter, must do with her pregnancy. They can't force her to abort a pregnancy ( which is a logical step for " you need permission from parents " ) and they cannot force her to continue the pregnancy either. Jyoshu, As could the pregnancy. In fact, young girls are more at risk. If harm is inevitable, which should it be? A situation the girl chose to be in harming her, or a situation she was forced into harming her? Additionally, abortion is safer than childbirth. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Why shouldn't they be able to? Even if one concedes that adults have certain rights on their own, surely you can concede that minors don't, even with their own bodies. For instance, if a minor has gotten obese, don't you think a parent is within their rights to only fix meals that are healthy and prevent the minor from eating junk food? Parents do things like this all the time when it is necessary. It is generally understood in our society that a parent knows better than the child on most matters. Besides, regardless of all that, children don't have the same rights adults do period. They can't vote, they can't drive, they can't buy alcohol, etc. Why should abortion w / out parental consent be any different?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You know what's funny? The same argument you and daewoo use can be used for abortion. The fetus would qualify as a " minor " if you had your way and it was " person " under the law, would it not? The mother decides for her own body, and she decides for the fetus since she gets to decide what the fetus does with its body. The next-of-kin argument applies as well since the fetus has not achieved conciousness ( in the majority of abortions ). There is no rationale where the fetus has any right to be attached to the woman when she does not want it to be. And they don't have the right to live attached to someone else without their parent's consent :p Perfect! <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You are taking the ' right to life, ' and putting on par with the right to drive, right to marriage, etc. I believe that the very right live is the first right a person should have and is not contingent on age. Other rights are. Like it or not, children have less rights than adults. So, are you going to try and deal with the argument presented or just bring up irrelevant comparisons? You haven't answered the question presented : since minors have to get parental consent for most any medical treatement, why do you think abortion should be different?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I apologize, I thought it was addressed. It is not irrelevant, however. You believe that the right to live is superior to other rights. You are wrong. Your right to live is not superior to my right to privacy, to my right to bodily integrity. You have no right to live attached to me. You believe that parents should be able to determine whether or not their daughter is attached to a fetus, yet you do not believe a parent should be able to determine if their " child " ( the fetus ) is attached to the parent herself? Similarly to STD treatment, which can be received without parental consent, decisions that affect sexual health are a lot more personal then anything you mentioned. A right to privacy in this manner is not contingent on age either. If children have fewer rights than adults because they have fewer life experiences, a fetus has even fewer rights because it has no life experiences.

People who choose to have unprotected sex should be aware of one of the possible consequences... pregnancy. Those who want not to become pregnant should not have unprotected sex or should use the rhythm method ( which is a form of protected sex ). Again, you ineptness shows. Many people choose to become pregnant. They purposely have unprotected sex in their attempts to become pregnant. Apparently, you are completely full of yourself.

All it takes is an abortionist and an abortive procedure. It can be self-induced in which case the pregnant female is the abortionist. It can be chemically induced, in which case the abortionist is whoever provided the chemical. It can be physically induced, in which case whoever inserts or operates the killing device is the abortionist. In the case at hand, the bat-wielding XXXXX now facing felony charges is the abortionist. Life begins at conception. This is not to say that the fetus is a person on day one. Obviously, there is a transitional period between being a dividing cell mass and a conscious person.

I think it is no less than what anyone else is doing here. - theo<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, the difference is that you want to force a woman to carry the child for 9 months, go through labor and the birthing process whether she wants to or not. That is really no sweat off your back. I, on the other hand, believe that God entrusted the female of the species with the ovum and I in turn trust God and therefore trust the female as well    much more so than a government. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The government is supposed to protect innocent life not legislate death to children. Sorry, you are wrong again, Howard. - theo<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are the one calling for legislation. I am saying that God entrusted the ovum to the female and the government has no place interfering with that. You must act according to your conscience -- as must I and everyone else. That is why God gave us a free will. He gave the female of the species a free will and entrusted her with the ovum. I do not claim to know the mind of God. I do not know why he did this ; I only know that he did. The ovum is part of the female anatomy, not separate from it. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>You know what, Howard. Alot of states have a seatbelt law. Why does the government care if I wear a seatbelt or not in my own car? Same logic you are purporting to me. The same with the Helmet law for motorcyclists. It is the motorcyclists head, not the government's! Why, Howard? Because the law was created to protect life!!! Wake up man! - theo<br><b> S2:4-  </b>A seatbelt law does not infringe on the inner workings of someone    s body    referred to by some as a temple. I know you are getting frustrated, but we are talking about a law that would interfere with the God    s creation and His creation of the ovum as part of the female anatomy. Why? We don    t know. To interfere with that is blasphemous. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>My point exactly, Howard!! So stop advocating it is a woman's right to interfere in the life of the child God gave her! - theo<br><b> S2:5-  </b>We can agree if you stop advocating it is a goverment's rights right to interfere in divine endowment that God gave women! <br><b>S1:6-  </b>We can agree if you stop advocating that God gave woman this right to murder her child. - theo<br><b> S2:6-  </b>So we can say that neither of us knows God    s will, but that we agree that God did not exempt women from the commandment    Thou shalt not kill    and did not give her the right to murder a child. We also agree that he made a divine pact with the female of the species, giving her dominion over the ovum and further, we agree that no government has the authority to interfere with that divine compact by forcing a woman into a nine month gestation period and subjecting her to a mandatory labor and birthing process, or in any way infringe on woman    s God given free will with regard to her reproductive system. What do you think? <br><b>S1:7-  </b>I think the government has the right to protect the gestation of the child etc... so on as you wrote. Just the same as its laws against murder are to protect and punish murderers. For some reason you see a woman having to bear her child as some kind of punishment if she doesn't want to. Well... her wants and a child's life are very different things. So we only partially agree with each other. - theo<br><b> S2:7-  </b>And your will and God's will are very different things as well, don't forget. My position is that the government has no authority over the male testicles and sperm and no authority over the female ovaries and ovum. Does the government have authority over neither, both, or just one in you opinion? <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Only when it involves a human life, again as I tire of this... abortion is murder. I think I've made that much clear. - theo<br><b> S2:8-  </b>You have stated your position, but just because we state a position doesn    t make it true. Just like you know that it is difficult for you to see things differently and change your mind ; it is difficult for others as well. Your position is that the fertilized ovum is a human being. Another position is that it is not. A third position is that it may or may not be, but that doesn    t matter because it is inside the woman and she has the say. In addition, and this is where the issue is, it is not enough to live by your position yourself, and to encourage and teach and enlighten people about how you see it, you want to have the government impose your position on others who do not see the fertilized ovum as a human being. Most people would say that you should live your life as you see fit, but don    t impose your beliefs onto my countries laws. That is the crux of it. All the best.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-4375_367_364__371_376_377_378_379_380_381_382_384_386_388_390_391_392_393_394_395_396_397_398_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Steeeeve : You say you can    t believe we are talking about this and then you reenter the fray. The conversation is silly. The only way this silliness stops is if one of us stops it. You believe that a zygote is a person and I do not. We disagree. You cannot prove you position absolutely and neither can I. It is what we each believe based on life and experience. I respect that. I will accept that you use words the way you do. Just accept that I use words the way I do. We disagree on the words usage and meaning too.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>But I thought you wanted to use the proper usage of the words such as human and human being? What you believe the words should mean aside, a human or a human being describe the same object. Under human is anything in th species homo sapian in which the zygote falls no matter how much you wish it didn't. So to call this object ( zygote ) a human ( n ) or a human ( adj ) being ( n ) would be the proper usage of the words. If you don't want to go with the proper usage then thats fine but like you said just because you say the zygote is not a human doesn't it make it so. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Human can be read as both adjective and noun. " Person " can only be read as a noun. Why not use the clearest terminology?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>so you agree that in proper usage you could call a fetus " human " or a " human being " or " person "? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I agree that you can use whatever terms you want. I use human as an adjective and    person    as noun and    human being    as a phrase with the same meaning as    person   . It is clear, simple and easily understood.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>so you agree that in proper usage you could call a fetus " human " or a " human being " or " person "? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>In proper usage you can call a finger or a toe or a kidney " human " as long it is of the species homo sapiens<br><b> S2:4-  </b>no you can't. You can't use " human " as the noun sense when referring to " toe " You could say " thats a human toe " but this is the adjective sense of the word which describes the species from which the toe came from. Likewise with " human being " you describe the being as that of the species human ( homo sapien ). so you agree that in proper usage you could call a fetus " human " or a " human being " or " person "? While human is used here as a noun and in human being is human is used as an adjective. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>That is exactly what I was saying and how I using using the word " human ". I agree again. You asked if I agree that    you could call a fetus    human :          an exact quote. I said yes because you did not say,    you could call a fetus a    human ". That is what I have been trying to tell you about word usage. The clarity of using the word    person    or the phrase    human being    and the ambiguity of using the word    human    alone because it has more than one usage. There is a difference between    human    and    a human   . The word human without the article a preceding it is almost always an adjective or at best ambiguous. A fertilized ovum is not a human being, it is not a person and it is not a human. However a fertilized ovum is human, it is a human zygote. That is proper English.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>This is where you fall again. How, in the correct usage of the words, do you get that? The fertilized ovum is a being that happens to be human as you have just pointed out therefore the fertilized ovum is a human being. The fertilized ovum is also A human because it qualifies under the definition which is just " homo sapien ". Why is this so hard to understand? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>You can say what you want. It is not supportable. Find a medical text book used by one of the top ten accredited medical schools in the country that says a    zygote is a human being    or    fertilized ovum is a human being    and you might have a case. I don    t think you will find one. Sorry.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>We are talking about correct usage of the words Beale. Stop trying to run. Looking at the word " being ", in the correct usage, we find that it is any organism that is alive.. living if you will. The human zygote is in fact a being under the correct usage of the word. The type of being happens to be human, thus human being. You are the one that wants correct usage. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>Nope. A zygote is no more a being than a turtle egg. Do you refer to a turtle egg as a    being   ? No. A zygote is not a human being. It is not a person. It is not a human. Sorry. I don    t agree. The words, term and phrases are not limited in usage the way you claim they are    in fact they are not even used the way you claim. Even Webster    s Dictionary states that    human being    is a noun. In its definition it does not differentiate the adjective from the noun, it defines the entire phrase ( human being ) as a single noun. That is the proper usage according to the dictionary.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>fine, use human being as a noun. The definition will be " a human " ( although in my Webster it doesn't have human being.. it has human engineering though ) http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=human%20being. The zygote is a human because it qualifies under the proper usage which is " of the species homo sapien " http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=human. Just give it up Beale.... proper usage means the unborn in all stages is a human, human, human being, person, etc. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>That is simply not true. A zygote is a cell formed by the union of two gametes. There are chimpanzee zygotes and horse zygotes and elephant zygotes. The only way you can communicate the species of a zygote is by qualifying it with the adjective human : human zygote. A toe is not necessarily human, a kidney is not necessarily human, a tongue is not necessarily human and a zygote is not necessarily human unless you qualify them with the adjective human : human toe, human kidney, human tongue, and human zygote. And none of them is a human.<br><b> S2:8-  </b>fine, the human zygote is a human because it qualifies under the proper usage which is " of the species homo sapien " <br><b>S1:9-  </b>No, Steeeeve, the human zygote is human, not a human. You use the adjectival definition of human ( of the species homo sapiens ) and then use it to define the noun " a human " by putting the article    a    in front of it. The definition of the word human as a noun is : a bipedal primate mammal, as opposed to the adjectival definition of human which is : of the species homo sapiens. It can be confusing. That is why I prefer to use person as the noun and human as the adjective. It is much less ambiguous.<br><b> S2:9-  </b>THE NOUN DEFINITION OF HUMAN : A member of the genus Homo and especially of the species H. sapiens. http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=human If you use webster it actually just says " a human being ". human being is commonly used as a noun but really is just an adjective with a noun. A human being is a being that is human... since you admit that the human zygote is human and it is obvious the human zygote is a being, then it would appear that the human zygote is a human being as well. It seems you need to use the proper terms yourself. Human zygote is of the species homo sapien and thus is a human and human and a human being and a person etc. <br><b>S1:10-  </b>I used the same link to define the word member in that definition of human being, " A member of the genus Homo and especially of the species H. sapiens ". Your dictionary defines the word member as : a part or an organ of a human or animal body, as : a limb, such as an arm or a leg or penis. http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=member By your definition I can see what you mean. The human zygote, a human limb, a human arm, a human leg or the human penis are all technically human beings. You better watch out how you define things. If you want to take control of the woman    s zygote, she may get control of you penis    using your definitions.<br><b> S2:10-  </b>HAHA are you just joking now? You take a definition and because you are not satisfied with it, you try to define every word in the defintion as something different then what it is. A member is also a distince part of a whole. Please Beale, you are just being unreasonable now. <br><b>S1:11-  </b>I thought it was pretty funny myself when I saw the precise definition of " member ". You were the one who quoted the definition of human : " A member of the genus Homo and especially of the species H. sapiens ". I just relayed to you what that definition meant. The dictionary uses arms, legs and other body parts as being members. Based on your definitions, I agree : a human zygote is a member of the species H. sapiens just like a human arm. You don    t like it because the definition doesn    t mean what you wanted. It does mean only    member    like being a    member    of the VFW or AFL-CIO. Too bad. It was your definition, not mine. I prefer to use    person    as the noun and    human    as the adjective. If we agreed on that there wouldn    t be all this silliness.<br><b> S2:11-  </b>You like to choose what member means... I don't think member means what you think it does in that definition. If you don't know what member of the species homo sapien means then maybe these debate forums aren't for you. Is anyone else reading this and believing what Beale is saying? Here is a clue Beale. TRY USING THOUGHT Member can mean many things as the definition shows. Does it have to mean all of them? No. It means what it means in the context in which it is put. In this case member of the homo sapien species means part of a whole. You are a sore loser Beale. I'm the one being silly? You are the one that twists definitions and is being... crazy... First you find a differnce between " human " and " a human " now you want to make it " person " and " human " of which you just play with words to get what you want. In the end Beale, the common sense of the words makes human, a human, person, human being, all the same thing. I don't want to be mean but your debating skills have gone down the toilet during this little debate. Come up with some good points instead of trying to skew results.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-4375_51_47__55_64_101_103_105_106_107_110_112_113_115_5<br><b>S1:1-  </b>So who's safe to say that " so and so " is the limit after which doing abortion is morally wrong? You probably personally don't think that killing a 8 months embryo is good because it's still a property of his / her mother as long as it's in the womb?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What do you mean? I don't understand your first sentence. Abortion is not morally wrong. The only morally wrong would be to force the woman to carry a baby against her will. Killing an 8 month fetus ( I think it's a fetus at this stage, not an embryo ) is not morally wrong, because it is still growing inside her. Her property? Only so much as her kidney is her property. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>so how come killing a life is less morally wrong then making a woman carry it till she gives birth??? Where do your standards come from? You choose one above another on what basis? I don't see consistency in your reasoning. Because this IS my question - WHO's in the position to say that doing abortion is better then making a woman carry the baby? Where's the standard?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It    s common sense. A person    s body is his or her own. Making someone go through surgery is morally wrong, making someone donate an organ is morally wrong, making someone go through a pregnancy is morally wrong. No one has the moral authority to require this. It is tantamount to slavery. Killing my slaver would not be morally wrong when he enslaves me, for example. I would be morally in the right. Babies are a gift of God. It is destroying it as a gift if you REQUIRE someone to continue a pregnancy against their will. If it is required, it is an obligation. An obligation destroys the concept of generosity and self-sacrifice. A woman must be willing to continue the pregnancy for the baby to be truly a gift. Otherwise it is merely an obligation, a perversion of the way things should be. What consistency is there in your reasoning? How do you choose the baby over the mother? What gives you the authority to say    the baby is more important than the mother   ? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>But baby is not an organ, it's temporary attached to the woman's body and that is it. I am not talking about specific medical reasons.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>While it is attached, it is using the woman's body to grow. The woman provides all sustinance, eliminates waste, provides warmth, etc. The woman is the body, in essence. And that body is her own body. She owns it, she controls who uses it. She is the only one with the moral right to do so. I ask again : What consistency is there in your reasoning? How do you choose the baby over the mother? What gives you the authority to say    the baby is more important than the mother   ? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>but still, ask any doctor if foetus is an organ or not. It's still not an organ. If I get a blood transfusion from you, will that mean that I am a part of your body?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I didn't say that the unborn is an organ, I say you cannot be forced to share your body in pregnancy any more than you can be forced to donate an organ. I apologize for the confusion. Could you force me to donate blood to you? Do you have the moral authority to do that? Do you have the moral authority to force me to donate blood to someone else? To the baby inside me? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>But if it's not an organ, then it simply temporarily inhabits the body. When you say " can't be forced to share your body ".... but we are both saying that it's not a body part, so what are we talking about?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Am I to understand you do not believe the baby in the womb uses the woman's body to live? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I didn't say that. Read your own words. Baby uses the woman's body. But it's not the woman's body. Not one of the organs of the body. Woman is not born with an embryo inside of her.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>In some ways it is, since the baby is of her flesh, using the nutrients of her body to grow itself. In some ways it is not as well. However, it is undeniable that it is using her body and that it is inside her body. While it is, she has a moral right to stop if it is against her will. It continues to use her body only as long as she is willing to let it. We can hope she continues, but we cannot command her to. So when I say " She can't be forced to share her body " that's exactly what I mean. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>So how come a fact of birth so radically changes the situation? Baby becomes a person with all the rights all of a sudden? I think when you reason you forget that even though connected and dependent on the mother, baby is a separate life and a human organism, and aborting it means killing it. You only consider the woman's choice and how no one can take it away, but you forget about the brutal act of murdering another person.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-6421_186_179__188_192_193_194_195_207_208_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I still think that it is morally wrong to kill an child in order to correct one's past mistakes. By having an abortion, it does nothing to clear your conscience or what you have done in the past that concluded in an abortion. Abortions should only be done to victims of or if either the mother or child's health is at risk, in these circumstances. Other then that, one cannot clear their past mistakes by choosing to have an abortion. If abortions are still legal, they should require parental consent for minors in all U.S. states. That way minors should feel guilty about the mistakes that they made in the past, unless they were d. By having parental consent, the parents can deal with their daughter, instead of the government.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This is a gross oversimplification and trivialization of why women choose abortions. There are a miriad of reasons, VALID reasons, women abort. Addressing those will do miles more to reduce abortion than all the self righteous preaching, demonization and trivialization will. When I was pregnant I considered abortion. Not to " correct a past mistake " ( why is sex necesarily a mistake? we are so damned puritanical ) - but because I was being denied access to medical care and I was worried about finishing my degree ( birth control failure with a year left of university ). Had abortion been illegal, those realities would have still existed for me. I didn't need abortion restricted - I had valid issues that needed to be addressed. They were and I was delighted - and I had my baby, my medical care and got my degree - which has helped make it possible for me to succesfully raise that baby ( jobs and education are not irrelevant selfish needs ). A law that disempowered me while trivializing my needs would not have resulted in a happy ending to this story. You seem to be of the mind that pregnancy should be used punitively. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>S*x is considered a mistake if you have it before you are married. Even though there are ures that encourage teenagers to have children, they are married first. S*x is supposed to be shared by a husband and a wife, however, in our society, teens have lost all morality based on this concept, so therefore it is a mistake. But abortion does not correct a mistake because you believe that you had s*x to early, but yet creates another mistake. Unless there are health issues. Even a victim shouldn't resort to getting an abortion, in contrast to what I previously stated a few posts ago. I just cannot see how someone could give up something so precious.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>By you. This is the second time in your posts I have seen you make a sweeping generalization like this. Personally I have had plenty of sex that I have no regrets about - however, my marriage was a mistake. Um - I think you have an over-inflated idea about who is getting abortions. There are plenty of grown women, women in relationships, and married women who also get abortions. Pregnancy is a REALLY big deal. Huge impacts to life, health, and finances ( try tens of thousands of dollars just to get through pregnancy ). Believe it or not - women, as a rule, aren't sitting doing nothing except waiting to be pregnant. They have lives, responsibilities, jobs, stuff oing on. The very concept that a woman's life should be forfeit for nine months due to a rapist is one that I find beyond abhorant. I am glad that you find the potential impacts of rape precious. Having been raped - I don't. By the way - the fact that your computer edits out words like RAPE and SEX - is very telling. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Look, I'm just a devoted Catholic that thinks it's wrong to get an abortion. The mur*ering of innocent infants is cruel, and yes, I consider abortion to be mur*er. It's just like ki*ling a defenseless person. You should be ashamed of yourself... Even if you're a victim of r*pe, you still don't " mur*er " a precious, innocent, and defenseless infant. The infant had nothing to do with what happened in the past, so why are you punishing them for what someone else did to you? You should punish the rap*st for what they did to you, not the infant.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I hate this stupid argument. It has NOTHING to do with punishment. Like I said - women have LIVES. I have a job, house, mortgage, child, health, and a livlihood. I will allow none of these things to be put at risk due to a rape. Hell - I would not put them at risk due to ANY pregnancy, but I mitigate that by safe sex practices and even having my tubes tied. Expecting any woman put her life on hold and herself, family or responsibilities at risk due to a rape is straight up hateful. Demanding it against her will is a violation - just like the rape was. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So you're saying that you're life and other people's lives are more important than the life of an infant that did nothing wrong to deserve an abortion?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No. I am saying that when the needs of the mother and the needs of the fetus are in conflict - only one can prevail. Are you saying that a fetus is more important than me or my son? Take a biology course not sponsored by the Catholic church. Having different morals than you does not indicate a lack of them. Broaden your mind to the fact that there is a wide world full of people who aren't just like you. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I don't mean having different morals and such from me. But Pro-Choicers have lost all sense of morality based on their choices. Basically, you and the rest of the Pro-Choicers are saying that the k*lling of infants is alright...</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-9634_17_16__21_23_24_25_28_32_33_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Yeah, reasonable people are OK with ripping unborn fetuses from their mother's wombs minutes before the baby would be born naturally! How dare those kooks try to defend the rights of the unborn fetus!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You don't really care which side, you just like the argument, huh? Where is this type of abortion commonly done? Once they have finished " ripping " the unborn ( abortion isn't very relevant once born ) fetus from the womb what do they do with it? What do you suppose the primary reason for waiting until until the baby is crowning to abort? Seems odd to go thru 9 months and labor to change one's mind. Why do suppose exaggeration and embellishment or an aversion to facts is necessary for some people who consider themselves pro life or at least anti choice? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>If you weren't a newbie, you'd know that I was anti-abortion. How many late-term abortions in which fully viable fetuses are killed are acceptable using your warped sense of morality? Mine says ZERO. You can try and deny the facts all you like. Here they are from the CDC for 2003, go spin them.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Newbie, I apologize for failing to recognize your elevated status and regret not properly researching you. Feel better now? Ahhh but that wasn't my response was it. You said To which I responded pointing out this to be an exaggeration or asked a few questions to clarify if you actually knew this to be happening. I made no mention of my position on the morality or whether I find it acceptable, but you avoided by making an assumption, throwing out an insult followed by a question. Should I consider that as yes it was an exaggeration and move on? I try not to put a spin on things. I also try to use the most relevant data as well as read those interesting little footnotes. Try it you'll see your report is off by 3 years, the numbers are similar, lower but not by much. By the way they are up to 2006 I would think <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You made an assumption about me that was clearly wrong. I pointed it out. So you consider 14,000 late-term abortions to be an exaggeration on my part? When dealing with government statistics, 6 years after the fact is pretty current. But I'm glad that you found more recent numbers to demonstrate my point. As for the shot you took on my use of references, do your research and you'll find I back up my factual assertions with references, unlike many others.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>If it had been that clear I would not have asked, but regardless you are correct it was still an assumption. What was an exaggeration by you is the quote below. Now if you want to say that what you describe below happened 14,000 times in 2003 then yes I will have problem with that as well. This was the reason I asked the questions you ignored. Make sense now? The more recent info was not to back up your point, which based on what you have posted is unclear except your pro life and don't know when late term abortions occur, but not relevant to you since you find the idea repulsive regardless of when it's done. I really don't see how A ) the more recent findings support you as while they are increasing they are lower than 2003. B) how that relates to whether someone who decides to play God, pass judgment and impose sentence on someone who is a law abiding citizen is guilty of a crime. God left us to govern ourselves on Earth. God governs in Heaven. Abortion may be a crime in heaven, but God deals with those. Here on Earth it isn't a crime and even if it was we have a process to deal with these things. Next you'll be collecting wood and kindling for the women who have abortions. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>[ QUOTE =p appillion 001 ;3 89189 ] If it had been that clear I would not have asked, but regardless you are correct it was still an assumption. What was an exaggeration by you is the quote below. Now if you want to say that what you describe below happened 14,000 times in 2003 then yes I will have problem with that as well. According to the CDC, there were ~ 14 k late-term abortions that were performed after a fetus is considered viable, so my comment about thousands was accurate and NOT an exaggeration. I see. It could be thought that my " minutes before birth " comment followed the thousands of late-term abortions. It didn't. The comments were independent of each other. Late-term is considered > 20 - 21 weeks. My point was that he didn't murder Mother Theresa, not that he wasn't guilty of murder. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. It appears that you are a drama queen. And abortion isn't legal across-the-board. Even the liberal SCOTUS that decided Roe V Wade admitted that states have the authority to regulate third trimester abortions.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>[ QUOTE = JPSartre 12 ; 38931 8] No you said ripping them from the womb minutes before they were born. That isn't late term that is birth. You know perfectly well nobody is intentionally and legally having an abortion during contractions. The exact quote is below. Why are you defending this to this extent. You said it and it was. You could have played it off and moved on. Instead you want to get sarcastic about telling me blue is really orange. You have made it a bigger deal than it was. My point was that he didn't murder Mother Theresa, not that he wasn't guilty of murder. You make no sense and this is a pretty weak attempt on your part. OK your right I'll be a drama queen, do you feel ok now? Were you able to man up with that one? Wanna maybe move on? Where are you taking this? Read what I posted in the context of the post, not some desperate attempt to save your wounded pride. How can you make a decent presentation sometimes and then come back with this? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Since you, apparently, aren    t familiar with late term abortion procedures, here it is : Note : the woman    s cervix is dilated. That is accomplished by inducing labor. When you induce labor, contractions result. Also note that the    fetus is partially-removed from the womb   . The fetus is typically turned around so that it would exit feet first because once the head is exposed, it is considered murder to kill the infant. But, as long as the head isn    t delivered before you kill the infant, it    s legal. Nice huh? See above. That    s why. Now, I understand that this barbaric practice isn    t representative of the mainstream of abortions, but it does demonstrate the lengths that pro-abortionist will go to retain    choice   . It    s a totally morally-bankrupt position, IMO. Because of the poor use of quotes, I    m clueless as to what you    re trying to say here. Care to try again?

How is that not supporting anarchy? What other segment of our Society has the right to kill a member of their own family because they are considered an inconvenience?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Just a nitpick here - they are not murdering anyone. Murder, by definition, is the unlawful killing of a human being. Besides the arguments over whether or not a fetus is a human being, abortion is legal, even if it were a given that a fetus is a human being, and thus cannot be murder. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yours is not a nitpick but a rationalization. Look around you oreo. Now envision all of the people you know and love. People you have known and cared for since childhood. Now think back to New Years Eve in Times Square and the million people that were there to celebrate together. Every single one of the people I've asked you to think of started out in the womb as a fetus. Are you saying that just because you can't personally hold or converse with a fetus then it has no value when you live in a World with 7 BILLION people who are all evidence of what a fetus will become if allowed to grow till its day of birth? So you see how your way of thinking and justifying abortion is nothing more than a rationalization, but an attempt at a justification? And a very weak one at that? I agree, but we live in the real World and I would compromise a perfect solution for an imperfect one if we could actually save more than a million infants, that as of today will surely die this year.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I am not saying that. I am saying that a fetus is not an existant being ( it has no mental existance ). Thus, in my view, it is at a much lower moral level than a living human being. I know I asked you to respond to it, but I meant a different post : post #107, which I would like your main response to. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And neither did you have no provable mental existence, or the people whose lives you value so much today. But you and they are all solid evidence of the intrinsic value within each of us. It's as if you're putting blinders on and saying just because I can't converse and intellectualize with an unborn child, I will call it a fetus and can in good conscience then approve of killing it before it is born. Forget the overwhelming evidence of what it will become as proven each and every time you yourself look into a mirror. I can assume it isn't a sentient being because It doesn't speak or eat or reason as I do. Do you see the incredible rationalization and foolhardiness in such self deception?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I put about as much moral value on a fetus as I do fish ( which, as a pesco-vegetarian, I eat ), as it is not sentient nor mentally existant. Yes, it is true that I had no proveable mental existance ( and, during that time, it would be perfectly acceptable if the fetus had been terminated ) and neither did those I value - you see, the main things that cause me to value these people come from the fact that they now DO have mental existence, and are sentient. No, you can assume that it isn't a sentient being because it doesn't have a mind - sort of the whole definition of sentience, now isn't it? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>But it does have a mind as is evidenced in each of us typing on these keyboards. The mind of the unborn just isn't developed yet. And you know this Oreo. Intellectually and factually you know they are people just like you. Answer me this. Is a blank DVD not yet a DVD until it has been recorded on? Or is it still a DVD, just one that hasn't been recorded on yet? I just bought a hundred new blanks and I didn't ask for that which will become DVDs once I record on them. See what I mean?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I am sorry, but your analogy does not work - for it to work, a fetus would need to have a brain and mental capabilities that are just not used yet - this is not the case : they do not have a brain, nor mental capabilities. Or, you would have to change it to speak of a piece of material that may or may not eventually be made into a DVD. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>What are you talking about? Of course a fetus has a brain. It's exactly like ours too, only smaller, in proportion to the size of its skull. Tell me Oreo, at what point in the development of a Human Being do you believe we get our brain?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-6839_208_165__211_213_214_215_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>That's why abstinence-only education is so unfeasible. Agreed. It might be hard though - a lot of the anti-gay " christians " would probably protest this. Agreed. In particular I think the law should be changed so the man has an equal right to chose - he should be given the option ( during the same time the woman is given the option of abortion ) to sign a sort of contract to terminate all of their responsibilities toward the child ( and thus not have a single right of visitation, etc. if it is done ) Very true, and I definitely agree with this. Umm... I'm really not sure what you're getting at here - what's wrong with co-habitating couples? All I see with a law like this is free license for a bigoted landlord to turn down gay couples who are unable to get a marriage due to their sexual orientation. If you meant this part differently, please say so, but if you meant it how I took it, then I disagree as all it would do is make discrimination towards homosexuals even easier, in fact justified by the law, and that is just wrong.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I'm not the one that supported it in the first place. I don't think that schools should have any sex-ed. It's not their responsibility. Why would ANY Christian opposed a measure that strengthens the bonds of marriage by putting more teeth in the contract? I don't totally agree. I don't believe in letting the father walk away if the woman doesn't have an abortion. He's still on the hook financially, IMO. The enforcement today is a joke, we both agree. [ quote ] Umm... I'm really not sure what you're getting at here - what's wrong with co-habitating couples? All I see with a law like this is free license for a bigoted landlord to turn down gay couples who are unable to get a marriage due to their sexual orientation. Actually, I woud allow them to refuse renting to opposite sex unmarried co-habitants, not same sex ones. This would give heterosexual couples more incentive to " do the right thing " when considering co-habitation. Incidently, this isn't any different than what has been practiced years ago before suit-happy America. Hotels could refuse to give rooms to unmarried couples and landlords could refuse to rent to unwed couples. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I didn't mean to imply that you were supporting it. Just stating that that was the reason it wasn't feasible. As to schools teaching sex-ed, I think that it might not be their responsibility, but it is now their task - I think leaving it up to the parents would simple be impractical and lead to an even higher abortion rate than there already is. Looking at the divorce rates in the Bible Belt, I wonder why you are asking this question. I definitely agree that it should be done, but somehow I don't think it will get all that much support from these people. I definitely agree with you with that being practical, but something deep down makes me feel uncomfortable with not allowing the male the exact same rights as the woman ( she can and has the right to terminate financial responsibility but the man does not ), but at the same time I think he really has a responsibility to provide financially. I think keeping him on the hook financially is probably the most feasible. Yep, it's pretty sad. Ah, that sounds a bit better. That's an interesting view I've never seen before, it could possibly work somewhat, but I'm not totally sure on it.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I don't see how that could be possible. There are people that believe that the desensitization that takes place during sex ed classes may actually remove natural inhibitions that would otherwise stop them from having sex. Do you think that " these people " would be any harder to convince than hedonistic heathens? :) It's not possible to give the man the exact rights that the woman has. The next best thing is financial. It actually isn't a new idea. As I said before, it was standard practice back in the " sane days ". <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Let's look at this logically. You seemed to agree that abstinence-only education just doesn't really work. Now, we see all over the place people trying to get it changed in schools so abstinence only is taught - Kansas is one example of one of the really ed up sections in this. So, let's say we let these people teach their kids and not get any education at school - since you agreed that abstinence-only doesn't really work well, it will logically not work in these cases - as they are not going to get any info on safe-sex from their parents or schools, those that choose to have sex will not be informed. Get it? When dealing with bibliolaters like Archangel and his ilk, it'd be pretty much impossible. I agree it is something that should be done, I just on't think the large group of Bible-belters getting numerous divorces ( nor many other people ) will like it or support it. Yep, I concede that this is as good is it'll get. Well, I never had a problem with it, so I guess I never really thought about it - my wife and I only began living together when we got married. That said, not sure how well it will be taken in today's society, but it seems to be a solid practice.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You misunderstood my basic position. I don't believe that ANY sex ed taught in school works and may actually be counter-productive. First, it robs time that could be spent teaching what schools were chartered to teach. Second, it may actually promote underage sex by desensitizing shy kids who wouldn't otherwise have the knowledge to know what to do. I don't see why not. There are several misconceptions about the causes of the high divorce rate in the South. For one thing, they tended to marry younger than in the North. Second, they tend to marry rather than shack up. Both of these factors paint an artificial picture of marriage in the South. What's worse, IYO. A divorce rate of 50% with a marriage rate of 70% of couples or a divoirce rate of 40% with a marriage rate of 20%? I'd rather have door #1, personally. With divorce, there is at least some protection for the children. In unmarried households, it's a #### shoot. My wife and I did similarly.... almost 30 years ago.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-4592_4_1__7_8_12_17_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>But what if a so-called Christian takes a position which is non-christian ( such as yours )?

BTW, check Exodus 21:22 - 23 for the only Biblical position regarding induced miscarriage or abortion.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>" 22 " If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely [ e ] but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands and the court allows. 23 But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise. " - Exodus 21:22 - 25 NIV It seems that God feels the life of the child is significant enough for him to say " you are to take life for life ". It seems that there is a punishment for someone else taking the life of the child... why would there be any reason to not create a law protecting the life of the child from abortion? Howard, I'm not sure I understood your first question above. Are you saying that my position is non-christian? - theo <br><b>S1:2-  </b>My point in having you read the Exodus verses for yourself was to show the ambiguity of the only verse in the Bible that even obliquely refers to abortion. My translation reads : " And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further injury, he shall surely be fined as the woman's husband may demand of him ; and he shall pay as the judges decide. But if there is any further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life. " ( Exodus 21:22 - 23 ) Since your position is not that it is Christian, but your personal faith, then I have no issue with you at all. I do ask you to question the belief because of the makeup of the female in God    s scheme of things and undue burden legislation would put on a woman. I think that Alan Simpson, Conservative Republican of Wyoming said it best when he said,    Not only shouldn    t men have a vote on the issue, they should keep their mouths shut.   <br><b> S2:2-  </b>Just because a woman is made to bear children doesn't mean she has some God given right to abort her child. I don't think you can support this view with God's word. - theo <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The issue I most often address is when people claim that it is a Christian position to be anti-abortion. If you notice, once you said it was a personal faith position, not a Christian faith position, I said : " Since your position is not that it is Christian, but your personal faith, then I have no issue with you at all.    ( Post #7 of this thread ). My position is that she was given the authority over the ovum by God in the creation of the female of the species and that it is not our place to interfere with that relationship. You cannot point to one word Jesus spoke that gave any person the right to interfere with the female reproductive process which God, in his infinite wisdom, placed within the female body. Any position that encourages that is fine as a US Citizen, but it is not Christian.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are inferring rights that aren't even given to women from the simple fact that God enabled women to have children. Women cannot have children on their own. There has to be a man in this equation. Let's imagine a married relationship where the wife is pregnant. For some unimaginable reason she wants to have an abortion but the husband doesn't want that. So the woman's right's over rule the husband's? It is his child as well. Most of all... that child belongs to God before it belongs to the woman or the man. The problem is that people are not seeking God's will in these circumstances but what best suits their own desires. Lastly, I asked you to prove to me that the Bible supports abortion... the woman's right to abort because she can carry children. Where is it? You are just making up rules to suit your desires and not depending on God's word at all. - theo</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-5174_23_21__28_29_30_31_35_38_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Yes I believe in strict government regulation of business.

Yeah, people. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>This is in line with my middle left political views. Green party all the way. Unregulated capitalism is a very bad thing. Ever read Dickens?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I think there is a difference in saying what you must have and saying what you can't have. Ok, does this apply to only businesses? What if the advisory panel says " in order to maintain health for the state, every citizen is required to own a toothbrush ". A free society works by saying " you can't do this stuff but everything else is up to you guys ". If you go around saying " you must do it this way " then you really aren't a free society but you have the government controlling instead. It is just inconsistent. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>No not at all it all comes down to individual rights. Business has proven that when it comes to individuial rights they can not be trusted and need to be regulated. Business will pollute the enviornment, extort the public, and exploit the poor. Unbrideled capitialism is unjust. Once again have your read Dickens? BTW why is this in the abortion forum. Unless of course you have an agenda with this thread.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I like how you say " individual rights " as if a business is some machine made up out of nowhere coming to attack the human race. A business is made up of " individuals " that are performing an activity. The activity of selling makes it a business. You can say individuals pollute and extort etc but you aren't for regulating their activity. So I take a consistent approach to this whole issue. You can regulate individuals and their activities so long as the people approve of it ( which doesn't mean I may agree with what the people wish to regulate ). Therefore if the people want to say " businesses can't pollute and homosexuals can't marry " then I believe they have every right to do so. Of course it becomes harder to regulate when mess with the constitution -- assuming US -- ( which none of the examples do ). I think you are just wrong to imply someone in a business is not part of the public. It has to do with the morning after pill <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Look at the state of business in the late 19th century when there was no regulation. Business in the name of profits would have no problem dumpping all kinds of toxic garbage into rivers and landfills if not regulated not to. If not forced to pay a minimum wage business in the name of profits would pay people an unjust wage and take advantage of thier being desprate. Business in the name of profits would cut worker safety. Busisness in the name of profits would do almost anything to cut costs. People in business, unless it effects them personally, are allways looking out for the bottom line and if there were no regulations on safety, pollution, and wages people in business will take any opportunity to cut costs.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Notice what you said here... You don't want a business to do this or that. These are restrictions as opposed to instructions. I am all for regulating some business activities as I am for regulating any individual actions. Individuals have done their fair share of " harm " outside of the activity of business. ou The thread is pretty clear about the topic... none the less, you are inconsistent here. Why are prescription drugs any different from other products? I doctor told me the other day to get a certain piece of equipment in order to help my back. Should I force WalMart to carry it? Tell me, what if the morning after pill becomes OTC? Should this change anything? Does WalMart have to carry IBuprofin along with Tylenol even though IBuprofin can cause some damage to your health?

All the credit for the good and none of the blame for the bad.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Depends on if you're talking about the God conjured up in the imagination of utilitarians, or the true, existent God. The will of the former always ends up always conforming to the ideal lifestyle of the creature, whereas the latter insists that the lifestyle of the creature conform to His will. So much so that He orcestrated ( i. e, He didn't simply allow, but was the cause ) of the greatest natural disaster in history, killing all but 8 people in the whole earth. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I consider all gods as conjured in the imagination.

So, I'm sure it doesn't really matter. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I did not suggest that nothing can be taken on faith. Nor did I suggest that all assertions of truth and existence are faith based. I did suggest that your assertion that your god is the true and existent God was faith based as are all assertions concerning supernatural beings.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Ok, so were you just simply stating your observation that " ' [ t ] rue and existent ' are faith based assertions? " And what exactly was your point in stating that observation? Right, and I think the antithesis to my proposition is an assertion of faith as well, that is, it is a belief. This might get a little confusing, so let me simplify. If the proposition " God exsists " is a faith based assertion, then so is the proposition that " God does not exist. " Either God exists or He does not. It takes faith to believe either option. You seem to disagree, but both statements are propositions that have truth values, and the one making either proposition believes them to be true. That is faith. I would obviously dispute the claim that there is no evidence that God exists, or for that matter, that there is no evidence that the God of a particular religion is the true God. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>If we substitute leprechauns then " either leprechauns exist or they don't ".

I see no reason, from what has been presented on this board, to believe that Dr. Tiller violated the law. As for " Genocide " and " infanticide ", well, that's pure hyperbole, and the kind of hyperbole that whooped up this madman toward his murderous act. Let me ask you this, Archangel. How can you say that you support third trimester abortions when the mother's health or life is endangered ( if I recall your position correctly ), if you don't think any doctor should perform this procedure?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That's a fitting question,... but only if it can be established that those ( life of the mother ) are the only occasions where the good doctor took late term babies lives. Health is such a broadly defined term that it would include 3rd trimester babies being aborted for even the most trivial of reasons.

On the one hand, saying that women can have an abortion during the third trimester if their life is at stake. On the other hand, saying that no doctor shall be available to perform this procedure because it is terribly immoral. Dr. Tiller is not answerable to the anti-abortion people of our society. He is a physician bound by laws and ethical rules governing his relationship with his clients. It's none of the anti-abortion community's business what's going on there.

And even with that in mind, you have a problem with doctors being required by law to try and save both the woman and her prebirth child in a " life of the mother " pregnancy such as my wife faced with my daughter? Thanks for adding one more pixel of clarity to the overal picture of a " pro-choice on elective abortion " supporter. I can't imagine that any of it would be of any interest. But it's not a specific person's records that anyone is after when we " anti-aborts " demand that doctors do everything they can to save BOTH the mother and their children in these " life of the mother " situations. The doctors can meet that requirments without us ( the general public ) ever knowing the mother's names, circumstances or outcomes. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>" Even "? You imply that you don't understand what I've said. I've repeatedly said that I support the law as decided by the court under Roe. You keep bringing up this experience in your family, and setting me up in your argument in some way as an adversary. I have no problem with what happened in your story. I am glad things worked out for you. What if the doctor had to make a choice, however, and there were no indicators from your wife one way or another? Are you suggesting that there shouldn't be a prima facie assumption on the part of the physician to save the life of the mother, if she or he cannot save both? Well, you seem to bent on repeatedly mischaracterizing my statements and arguments. So I gather you will believe what you want to believe about your imagined foes. No matter what they say. Oh no? Let's say I'm with a religious group that thinks vasectomies are immoral. We think doctors who do this are engaged in a form of mutilation. Let's say you've had one. Maybe we're interested in that. Have a problem with some of your fellow private citizens having a peek at their discretion? No, it doesn't work that way, either.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Then you would have to agree that ( under Roe ) the State would have the right to require doctors to do everything in their power to treat and save both lives in a " life of the mother " pregnancy. In this modern era of technology and communications, Doctors do not act without the means of communication or without the oversight of other doctors. I am suggesting that the law should require that every reasonable attempt be made to save BOTH the woman's life and her babie's life / lives. It would be decided by committee if a baby in extreme cases is to be aborted and it would be subject to State review to insure that all attempts were made to save the child. Remember, these are children that are supposedly wanted by their mothers. Right? How have I mischaracterized you in any way? I have only asked you questions. I have not drawn any conclusions at all. You are building your own characterization with the answers you provide. As I know I can defend my decisions ( medical or otherwise ) I personally would have no problem with that at all. The truth is the truth and as a realist I have no problems stating the truth. Sure it does. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>No, I don't agree with that. Roe is about abortion. You are addressing what a doctor does when a woman, who intends to carry a pregnancy to term, goes into premature labor and the fetus is in a fuzzy territory of viability. I don't know enough about what the law presently is, here, to discuss this with you more. The only thing I am aware, as I said before, is that I have heard some nurses assert that keeping premies alive at all costs is not always in the best interests of everyone involved. So I think this involves choices best determined by the family affected and their medical providers. I am glad you and your family were able to make the best decisions for you, and as only you and your family should. But I do not think you can make these decisions for others. No, I do not think a committee, as you describe, is appropriate. I think the family and their physician, and any other medical opinions they freely seek out, are equipped enough to do so. Such a committee is just a waste, and making an already difficult enough time, more difficult.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Roe was decided on State's rights verses Individual privacy and when the State has the right to intervene in a woman's pregnancy. Because of that fact, a law stating that doctors must do all they can do to guard the lives of women and their prebirth children in a difficult pregnancy would be very much in line with the decision in Roe.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8920_310_308_1_314_318_322_323_327_329_12<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Well, the problem with cynicism is the person has had a lot of bad experiences in life, but not a lot of good ones. Those good experiences are part of reality too, and without which, we don't have a very realistic grasp of things. I am fortunate because I've had family members who've fought in certain wars, and my family oral history is alive enough, for me to have an identification with certain ancestors, and what they fought for, as well. This gives a person a certain personal feeling of possession about history, which I think the American public school system, for the most part -- at least when I was attending ( which is not recently ) -- tends to take that away from people. But the history of this country is ours, not the historians, though I like historians today fine enough. You know what I mean, I think. To me, calling a person a terrorist is an extremely denigrating descriptive. I'm not going to denigrate John Brown. I refuse to characterize him as such. No one's going to take my history away from me. Besides, everyone's a terrorist, lately. And I think we will outgrow this perspective, too.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Be consistent in your comparisons. If one man murders people in what he believes to be a righteous cause, and he is a hero, then another man who does the same is a hero. By the same token, if one is a terrorist, the other is a terrorist. John Brown was motivated by noble ideals. Scott Roeder was motivated by what many people view as noble ideals. There isn't a difference between the two. Many thought slavery was a terrible thing, many thought it was necessary. Same with the abortion debate. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I haven't read anyone as saying that Roeder was motivated by noble ideals. Just that, because there is holocaust of millions of babies, they can understand why he did it. There is one important difference. Slavery involved real human beings and was a terrible thing. There is no holocaust of millions of babies.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Do you realize the ones who believe that Roeder was motivated by noble ideas are the ones that don't get press time? So, abortion doesn't involve real feti? Are you telling me that those feti are just baby dolls that look extremely realistic? Who are you to say that abortion isn't terrible? It scars women for long after it happens and creates a large emotional stigma. It's terrible to the people who have to make the decision in the same way that slavery was terrible to the slaves. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Well, they have plenty of press time here. So if you think Roeder was motivated by noble ideals, you are free to make your insane case. Abortion involves a real embryo or fetus. That embryo and fetus are the real thing. Who are you to say, unless it's your body? Rubbish. Women are generally relieved, after having an abortion, and besides, it's up to the woman in question as to whether or not she wants to do anything that risks " emotional stigma. " Only if women don't have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. But in the United States, where I live, women have had the right to choose since Roe V Wade was passed.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Obvioulsy, I don't believe Roeder was motivated by anything good. I'll concede that they aren't babies, but you're still killing something. Have you had an abortion? Can you show me women who are relieved? And I'll specify it to come to terms with Tiller, can you show me a woman who is relieved to have a late term abortion? I'm sure there are many women who have early term abortions that are relieved, but the women who carry it around with them and then decide to kill it can't feel relieved. And it's not physical slavery, but emotional slavery. The women who have late term abortions or changes of heart after the fact are bound emotionally to the decision. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Of course you are. The American Psychological Association has published research showing that women, for the most part, feel relieved. Still meaning, either way, it's the woman's right to choose. Well, it's their decision. Between that individual and their physician, and anyone else they freely choose to involve in that decision. Right or wrong for them, it's their decision to make, not yours or mine, and none of our business.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You failed to answer a question. Have you had an abortion? I'm not arguing against abortion or for it, I'm arguing against your faulty premise that the abortion debate can't be related to slavery. Cite your source on that APA study. Because I found multiple sources that say while some women feel relieved, others have emotional problems. I would like to know whether these women had early or late-term abortions. Either way, I doubt the majority is relieved.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8920_73_70__75_79_81_85_91_95_97_118_4<br><b>S1:1-  </b>And I suppose the three New York police officers who gunned down the black groom on his wedding day in a hail of 51 bullets, were just innocent men who were doing their jobs. Here's the thing that you don't seem to get. Well actually two things. First, the man in question wasn't permitted to kill anyone. Second, we're not a civilized society.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You make an odd comparison here. How does Dr. Tiller engaging in his medical practice resemble the tragic shooting of an innocent man by police officers? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Well according to some, both parties in this comparison were just doing their job. In the case of the police, it was killing an innocent man with greatly excessive force and destroying the public's trust and support of police officers. In Tiller's case, he was killing unborn children who could safely be brought to full term. No matter how many times you try and rehash the point, it doesn't matter. Tiller killed children just before they could legally be classified as people and awarded protections under the law. If he had killed them outside of the womb he would've been facing the death penalty or life in a maximum security prison. Yet doing the exact same thing a week before delivery is supposedly better and morally superior.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Which is NOT the issue here. It doesn't matter what you think of Dr. Tiller's legal medical practice. There was NO justification for someone to murder him. You continue to act as though Tiller should be held somehow morally responsible for his own death. No. He was the murder victim. There was ONE wrong here, and that was the murder of Dr. Tiller. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Nobody's arguing otherwise. However the truth about Tiller's practice must be taken into account as well. A victim, perhaps, but he wasn't an innocent victim.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>He was innocent under the law, and he was providing a needed medical service for women. Dr. Tiller's work took a lot of courage, given the death threats he received and the attacks he suffered even before this murder. Dr. Tiller was a courageous man who stood by his convictions, and it led to his being killed. How tragic. What a loss. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Oh grow up! We all know about the many cases of doctors performing unnecessary surgeries, mongering the fear of cervical cancer to scare women into getting hysterectomies that they don't need, and reaping the profits that come from such illegal and immoral practices. Tiller was just another one of these doctors, performing unnecessary abortions, killing countless healthy babies that could've been safely delivered without posing a health risk to the mother. A needed medical service to women? What a crock! What was stopping them from having the fetus aborted when it was just a mass of cells similar to a parasite? Why did they have to wait until it was just before delivery time to decide that they didn't want it?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I am grown up. I am 54 years old, which is plenty grown up. I respect the work that Dr. Tiller did. And he was providing a needed medical service for women. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>A needed medical service... yeah right! If these women truly were in need of abortions they would've gotten them earlier on when they weren't developed. They wouldn't have waited until it was down to the wire just to let the killing happen if they truly needed to have an abortion, they would've done it immediately after finding out they were pregnant.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>It's not up to you to decide when someone else should have an abortion or any other medical procedure. It's none of your business. It's up to the woman and her doctor.

I know he was a man who loved his country, deeply spiritual and ahead of his time, and I know he wanted to end slavery. And I feel grateful to the men and women who've risked or given their lives for our freedoms. You think you've seen life, but you haven't. ( Not that I have so much, either, but in this respect, I think I have a little moreso. ) <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I rather be a cynical person with a realistic outlook on life then a optimist who ends up disappointed. I've seen people get raped, murdered, for thinking people were " nice and trying to do things for them. " I've been abused and betrayed by people I trusted. Heh. If you've seen more then me then I pity you. Your life must well and truly suck. If you're foolish enough to think that those people did it for you then go ahead but based of my life experiences they did it for themselves. That's how people are even the most " pure " of people do it for the gratification of helping someone else. Ultimately 99% of human behavior is self-serving. That's how we as a species are. Personal interpretation is a beautiful thing isn't it?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Well, the problem with cynicism is the person has had a lot of bad experiences in life, but not a lot of good ones. Those good experiences are part of reality too, and without which, we don't have a very realistic grasp of things.

This argument is really going nowhere you're not going to consider a cold blooded murderer a terrorist and I'm not going to consider him anything but. Also : Lol at the no grip on reality. That can go both ways you know! I think my grip on reality is a bit too strong. Yours is the one that probably needs to tighten up a bit.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So that's why union soldiers sang a tributary hymn to John Brown as they marched into battle? And why we still sing it today? Because John Brown was defined as a terrorist? And why we have great works of art depicting Brown as intimately with God, and being kissed by the common people as he was led, walking proudly, to the gallows? I don't know what country you've studied music or art in. But obviously, you versed in historical revisionism. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Yeah you obviously didn't read my posts. Some considered him a hero some considered him a terrorist, some considered him both. Is that so hard for you to understand. Also I don't sing hymns about terrorists. And art is subjective there's plenty of art depicting Hitler in a good light. Why would you use something as subjective as art? I find a drawing of an angel and a demon being lovers. Heck I found one of Hitler and Hussein making out. Just because someone writes / draws something doesn't make it automatically true. You're in your own world at this point. Even when your fellow pro-choicers point out the hypocrisy of your statements you ignore them. I can't debate with someone who refuses to see the other side of the argument because it means that you will never understand my point of view. This time I'm ending the argument. I can't argue with people like you. You're the same as those pro-lifers who insist that abortion is wrong regardless and don't listen to what anyone says not to change their minds but merely to let the see the other point of view. Its kind of funny how similar the two sides are in the end.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I responded to your post word for word, using a cut and paste that proves it. Now you're engaged in blatant dishonesty. It's not my fault if you can't express yourself coherently. You are incorrect ITO of the extent to which people perceived him in a negative light, with the exception of the Confederacy. And American history has paid tribute to John Brown quite grandly through highly valued, timeless and famous pieces of music and art. There is no such immortalization, on such a scale, otherwise. Then I don't believe you went through the American public school system, since students quite commonly sing hymns to John Brown as part of music. Your " terrorist ", that is... You argued that Brown is conceptualized in our national consciousness and definition as " a terrorist ". I am demonstrating that he was not then, and he is not, now. Brown was very religious, as most abolitionists were, but the similarity ends there, along with the form of Christianity they were practicing. Among the pro-choice movement, there is a lot of diversity in background and beliefs. I think you are oversimplifying.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-6950_22_17__26_27_29_32_37_38_40_57_58_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>A brain-dead 85 year old can be kept alive on a MACHINE. A machine is not alive. It cannot think, feel, talk, walk, cry or laugh. We can choose to keep a brain-dead 85 year old attached to it regardless of its own thoughts and opinion, because IT HAS NO THOUGHTS AND OPINIONS OF ITS OWN. A fetus requires the body of another HUMAN BEING. That human being is thinking, feeling, talking and walking. She is not a machine. She is a woman. What you are suggesting is that a woman and a life-support machine are exactly the same. They are not.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This observation simply doesn't change the fact that the woman is choosing to kill another human being, which is what the discussion with chemist was about. He made an analogy that is actually not analogous. That is all my illustration was intended to point out. The essence of the entire abortion discussion should center on what it is that the woman is electing to kill. She is not choosing to kill a nothing. She is choosing to kill a human being. For you it appears to be a matter of rights conflict, which is where I suppose most pro-choice people simply give the mother the benefit of that conflict. However, I simply do not see that a woman ought to be able to make this choice for any reason she has ( such as gender selection, for example ), which current policy allows her the absolute right to do. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Your analogy was wrong, with respect. Women are thinking, breathing, living people. Life-support machines are not. Your analogy would only work if a woman and a life-support machine are one and the same. Nevertheless your analogy doesn't change the fact that you wish that all women who do not want to remain pregnant, be forced to remain so, and forced to give birth, simply to satisfy a moral objection that you personally have. Fetuses have value. But as long as they require the body of another person to live, that person must have her own rights respected. To ignore this is to reduce women to a mere machine ( much like a life support )<br><b> S2:2-  </b>The problem is that I did not make an analogy. You've simply created a strawman here. The posts to chemist deal with what it is that is being killed. He is making a different argument from you. Let me try to clarify : whether the woman is a machine or a person has no bearing on the question of what the fetus is. It has no bearing on the personhood of the fetus. That is all that was being discussed between chemist. To read it outside of that context is to put words in my mouth which I did not say. To argue against those words that I did not say is to set up a strawman only so you can set him on fire. Well, that simply doesn't fly. Oh the terror. Your emotionally charged language does not change one thing. It is unethical to kill another human being. I don't disagree with this. I disagree that the woman has the very unique ( i.e., only women have it ) human right to kill another human being. Women are not machines, and I have not suggested anywhere that they are. You are not going to get very far on these forums if you insist on setting up strawmen. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And your emotionally charged language does not change the fact that you don't give a toss about women. As long as everyone understands that that is where you are coming from that's fine. But you can't not disagree and then disagree with the same point. Morally, I DO believe a woman has the very unique human right to kill another human being, WHEN that other human being resides IN HER BODY. Pregnancy is a unique status. Nothing is comparable. You want to protect a zef's " Right " to live. But to do so from conception to birth, you need to impose BY FORCE upon a woman, both pregnancy and childbirth. That is far more of a vile act than any abortion, IMO. With respect, how far I go on these forums is a matter for myself alone. And there is no strawman. The implication of your post is that the brain dead 85 year old is the equivalent of the fetus... the machine the equivalent of a woman. You see, just because you state " it is a strawman ", it doesn't actually mean that it is.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>It is precisely because I do care about women that I do not think they have a magical right to kill another human being -- a right that no one else appears to have. Do you think a woman has the absolute right to elect an abortion solely because the fetus is a female, when the woman simply wanted a male? Do you think that is the exercise of an ethical choice? If so, do you think that this is a position that deeply cares about women? What basis do you say this? What is the ethical principle you are applying? And what is the ethical basis upon which you make this comparison? Where does this hierarchy of values come from? Yes, there is a strawman. And the proof of it is in your next quote. The implication of my post is not that the 85 year-old is equivalent to the fetus. The direct and explicit point of my post is that the 85 year-old brain-dead patient and the fetus are quite different. There also was no equivocating between a machine and a human being. There simply was not. As such, your response to my " point " was a response to an argument I never made. That is the setting up of a strawman only so you can easily burn him down. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Women have a right to terminate a pregnancy because women get pregnant. If men got pregnant, the law would apply to them and not women ). There are a myriad of reasons why women have a right to abort. Life of mother, severe disability, rape / incest are the three most common reasons throughout the world as to why women have the right to abort. Pregnancy and childbirth are unique circumstances. Nothing magical about it. And, do you think that a society in which women want to terminate girl babies purely because its female, is a society that " deeply cares about women "? Women living in these societies have bigger problems to face on a day to day level, than the likes of you moralising about fetal rights. But then you care about women, so you'd know that, right?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I don't know where you live, but in the United States women have the right to abortion because seven people thought it would be a good idea if they did. You have listed three of the rarest reasons why women elect to abort. This is as pointed out by the study cited by the Guttmacher Institute. I don't know what you are saying here. I am perfectly able and willing to say that a society that allows a woman to terminate a pregnancy based solely on the fact that the baby is a female is a society that does not care about women. You, on the other hand, conveniently neglected to address the question. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>[ QUOTE ] No I don't think so. Women have the right to access to legal abortion in the first trimester if I'm correct. Note : RIGHT TO ACCESS TO LEGAL ABORTION. Those seven people have never suggested that having an abortion is a good idea, nor do they force women to undergo abortions. I never suggested they were rare or not rare. I was using them because they are the UNIVERSAL reasons for access to legal abortion. I.e. they are the most accepted reasons for termination across different countries and societies. Nice dodge. Why do women seek to terminate girl babies en masse? It might have something to do with the fact that those countries that they have the misfortune to live in, look down upon and despises women and girls and that when women give birth to girls they are considered failures within their family and community. THAT is what needs changing. To use these women to further an anti-abortion stance ( especially from a woman ) is sad.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>In the United States, the trimester system ( which was invented by judges ) has been done away with ( again, by judges ) in favor of a new standard known as the " undue burden " standard. In summary, this allows the woman the absolute right to abortion up until the point of viability. After this point, the state may act to restrict abortions so long as such restrictions do not pose an " undue burden " on the ability of a woman to get an abortion. Not surprisingly, this does not allow for much ability to restrict. These are the most cited reasons, yet they are the rarest actual reasons for abortions. All I am suggesting is that those three reasons, if they are justifications at all, are only justifications for abortions in those particular instances. It is not logical to say, for example, " We need legal abortion for the cases of rape and / or incest, " and then cite that as a reason for legalizing abortion for gender selection. No dodge, as my answer in a later post shows. Once I understood what you were saying, I answered. As such, I probably do not need to repeat my answer in this post. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Thanks for that. I was unaware! Fair enough. I understand. There does come a time when it all just ends up going round in circles</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-6583_93_90__95_96_98_99_100_101_102_103_104_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The facts of that were as follows : Parent rights a note saying " Don't do drugs " and was a strong opponent of marijuana. You then went and assumed the message was for recreational drugs, and that the reason not to do them was because they are bad. Afterwards you based a conclusion on that. Lets take this example and convert it to a law. The constitution says " dont do drugs " and at the time marijuana was illegal and considered a drug. Fifty years later scientists claim marijuana is actually good for you. Does this make it so marijuana can no longer be forbidden by the constitution if a judge agrees with the scientist using the rubric you find so dear? I would say the only reasonable view of that law would be to say that unless congress changes the law ( or amends the constitution ) then marijuana will always been considered under that law. Otherwise you have changed what it meant. You assumed things that might misrepresent what the law meant just like I can assume things and misrepresent what you say. When this happens what you said or what the law says didn't change.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You're not talking about static meaning, you're talking about static application of the law. The most rational and logical view would be to look at the meaning of the prohibition ( that recreational drugs are detrimental and have no legitimate benefit ) and then say " pot has been shown to have major benefits and few detriments. Therefore, by the meaning of the prohibition, pot is exempted from the ban ". The meaning was preserved and the application of the law is allowed to change to meet the changing society and situations. Imagine the Constitution had no specific prohibition against blacks. Regardless of the personal feelings of the authors, interpreting the meaning of the Constitution would allow them equal rights. Similarly, regardless of the personal feelings of the parents interpreting the meaning of the prohibition would allow pot to be exempted. That is the most rational conclusion. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Again, you just added stuff that didn't exist in my example. It had no prohibition against woman yet they did not have equal rights. Took the 19th amendment just to force states to let them vote.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>lol, Steve. Whatever meaning you wish to put, if the meaning no longer applies to pot then pot should not be covered by the ban regardless of how the authors felt about pot specifically. You seem to want a static application but you're inconsistent about it. Then by the meaning of the Constitution such an Amendment wouldn't be strictly required and laws prohibiting women from voting could be struck down as unequal application of law ( after Incorporation, anyway ). However, as with any law, saying something specifically eliminates wiggle room and prevents jokers, such as yourself, from saying " original application didn't cover women omg omg! " ;) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Not sure what you are saying but are you saying the 19th amendment is not required? Seems the 14th amendment never worked before including a Supreme Court case that rejected the idea that the 14th amendment gave the right to vote for woman.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Could you cite the case? That's the point, Steve. If there are possibly multiple interpretations then without an explicit Amendment there is no guarantee. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Minor vs Happersett It argues using the same method every judged ( for the most part ) used until the early to mid 1900 s. Finally, your comment makes no sense. If there are " multiple interpretations " then an amendment is never a guarantee... not even the 19th.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>lol, the case supports my view. The case even stated that equal application would indeed nullify the law and allow women to vote if voting were a Constitutionally protected right. They decided the " right of suffrage " was not Constitutionally protected. If the right of suffrage is one of the necessary privileges of a citizen of the United States, then the constitution and laws of Missouri confining it to men are in violation of the Constitution of the United States, as amended, and consequently void. The direct question is, therefore, presented whether all citizens are necessarily voters. Were it decided that voting was a right of a citizen then equal protection would do the job of the 19th. Whether women were originally intended to be included is irrelevent. My statement stands ;) An unambiguous Amendment would be less subject to interpretation. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Not sure how that supports your view unless your view is that the 19th amendment was needed and I already stated I think it was but your view wouldn't. Did you just not read the case? I'm not exactly sure what you are thinking but the case ruled the 14th amendment ( 9 - 0 I might add ) doesn't protect a womans right to vote. Please enlighten us on how this even remotely supports your viewpoint. " Due Process of Law " seemed rather unambiguous too but we see how that one turned out.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>While I failed to take into account that voting is not a right and so my claim was not true, my view is still validated. It doesn't matter the view of the authors, or whether or not women were excluded at the time of writing. All that matters is the message of the Constitution and the meaning behind it. Many of the Amendments are written in a rather ambiguous manner, including the 14th. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>which has never been your thoughts until this very post and I still doubt you mean it. My point is that the meaning behind the constitution does not change and the meaning certainly doesn't change to fit with " current times ". This case uses originalism to make the decision and did so according to the law. The fact that voting was a privilege of some didn't mean it ever applied to voting. I'd say this amendment is rather clear... even more so for the due process clause. Would you disagree?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3037_103_90__107_109_112_118_122_123_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I am glad you quoted inalienable and defined alienated.... we are talkingabout UNalienable and alienable. How so? If my right to life is withdrawn then it doesn't matter if I am killed or not because I never had a right to live in the first place. This is not the case. But we are not talking about alienated... we are talking about alienable. Alienable is different because it involves transfer. So the word alienated doesn't go here... I don't know where that came from. Unalienable rights, means rights that can't be seperated nor taken away. And the right to life cannot be taken away. Someone can't take your right to life. How does one transfer a right to life from one to another? If you wish to believe this, then you don't believe in the foundation of this country. Also with this belief, you would say that slavery was ok and that blacks being denied rights was ok and women being denied rights was ok. If the government makes rights then the right to a black person to be free ( live ) didn't exist. If it didn't exist then it wasn't wrong. How could slavery be wrong if there was no right against it? The ides that government creates rights is the non-sense.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I see you again shy from discussing rights outside of gov't.

ANSWER IT OR CONCEDE THE ARGUMENT Good. We still are. I a merely going deeper into what those mean. Why not? That is exactly how it works. If you right can be removed it is not inalienable. Alienable means able to be alienated. The dictionary. The foundation of this government is based upon self governorness and freedom from dictatorship. Not rights. How so? I never said that was correct. My entire argument is that rights only exist if they are enforced. You are arguing that rights exist as a universality, yet you constantly AVOID arguing outside of goverment. Slavery is wrong for economic reasons. The idea that rights exist otuside of goverment is nonsense. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>INalienable does not equal unalienable alienate does not equal alienable Alienable means transferable of ownership to another. Alienate means more of a withdrawn in this case. if you believe this, you might want to take a few more US history course. We refer to the Declaration of Independence ( DOI for short now ) because it shows this best. The DOI says we have rights... England was stomping on this rights which are unalienable... therefore, we ( US ) will make our own country. This started it all. And what do you think freedom is? It is the ability to have your rights not stomped on by the government. As for the slavery example... you would be claiming that the slaves had no rights back then. So then why was it wrong? For economic reasons??? Slavery was only wrong for economic reasons? It had nothing to do with the treatment of people?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If your right existed, and was inalienable, then the ocean would abide to it. That obviously is not true.

It doesn't make it true... but in the case of the DOI it shows what our country is based on... the belief of rights given to us by the creator that the government can't stomp on.

The point is... Unalienable is a bit more... this doesnt matter... use the DOI word... UNALIENABLE. They were " stomped " on.. not taken away. The people that fought for independence thought that rights were unalienable... how could you deny this? They wouldn't say unalienable if they meant they wanted their own government to create their owns rights.... Why didn't they want this?

I will argue that it is the view which presents the highest view of human life, and thus the highest view of women. This view allows that there is inherent dignity within each human life and therefore everyone should be treated with dignity and respect. And, even if they aren't, their life has value. This value was not given by humans and therefore cannot be taken away by humans. The predominate view which is at the heart of the pro choice movement is secular humanism. Everything has happened by chance and therefore mankind is a random wart on the face of a random meaningless chance universe. Therefore all human life is just the sum of its parts and is no better than dirt. It has no inherent meaning. Therefore, women have no value - they are no better than dirt. Therefore, the view which predominately drives the pro life movement places a view of women that is exceedingly and abundantly trancendent above the view which predominately drives the pro choice movement.

You do not know his infinite wisdom in placing the ovum and biology necessary for gestation and parturition with the female.

The changes that take place at delivery are that the foetus becomes a separate organism, with it's own oxygen supply and it's own food supply rather than sharing it's bloodstream with it's mother. The changes that take place at conception are that new DNA is created. The changes that take place over a period of time during pregnancy is that a foetus gains a complex enough mental state to be called ' concious '. What are the changes that take place at blastocyst implantation, and what makes them so significant that you can elevate them above any one of the three ' turning points ' above? Science doesn't say that.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>iangb : I speak Spanish. My knwoledge of English grammar is not perfect, of course. Do you know what is breast feeding? Human beings are mammalians? Do you know what parental duties means? Are you sure : a ) That a four or five month fetus has not conscience? b ) That a newborn has fully developed conscience? Do you know when synapses emergence is over? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes, I know what it is. I also know of mothers who have never breast-fed. Are you trying to imply that, because a baby is sometimes breast-fed, it retains a biological connection to the mother similar to the umbilical cord? I'd call that stretching the boundaries of ' biological connection ', personally... Before birth, if the mother dies, the foetus dies ( with one noticable exception that I know of ). After birth, this is no longer the case. Again, yes. How is this relevant to turning points ' in the eyes of science '? Seeing as that is what we are looking at this with, it would make sense to continue in a scientific vein... Nope. It's an emergent process. That was my side-point : life is emergent, and does not necessarily have a clear starting point, even if you can agree what ' life ' actually is in the first place. I've answered your questions, could you answer mine? To repeat it - what happens at the point of blastocyst implantation, and what makes that event so significant as to distinguish it from other ' turning points ' such as conception, birth or the development of the mental / nervous system?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>iangb : 1 ) Do you know what is a surrogate mother? 2 ) That is not a " noticable exception ". That cases are common even in my country. If parental duties exist towards an extrauterine child, why not towards an intrauterine child? When a blastocyst is implanted, organogenesis begins, a very active process starts. A blastocist may remain frozen, exactly as sperm. A human being is not only a clot of cells as morulla is. A human being has organs managed for a brain-nervous system. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>1 ) Again again, yup. But the baby is not biologically ' parasitic / symbiotic ' to the surrogate mother, just as ( after birth ) it is no longer biologically connected to the biological mother. 2 ) Do you have some evidence of this? I ask out of unrelated interest - it's not particularly relevant how rare the event is. The mother's body is kept ' alive ', despite her brain death. I'm still waiting for how there is a biological connection post-birth. Because the majority of the world does not have the same definition of ' child ' as you do. You're entitled to your opinion - but you have yet to show why your definition is the one that should be used. And when a child is born, it begins to breathe on it's own. And an implanted blastocyst does not have individual organs.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>iangb. Would you support that a surrogate mother would have the right to kill your loved daughter / son, despite your wife were crying because she loved that child? Even C section is so called due to Julio Cesar. In the past, often mothers died during delivery. Children were extracted by using that maneuver. Here in Mexico, cases when a mother died some hours ago but the baby was delivered alive were anecdotic in XXth century. Rub   n Le   ero, MD, performed that kind of surgeries. Even in recent times, that cases are commented sometimes in newspapers or TV. As medical science evolves, it is being more evident that the baby and the mother are two separate persons. Breas feeding. Remember it. Even artifitial incubators are an artifitial connection to an artifitial mother, in some sense. Are you saying that if the majority of the world say that Earth is flat, it is flat really? Do you know what is an argumentum ad populum? Are you saying that an adult connected to an artifitial respirator is " ethically murderable "? Do you know when spleen, liver, optical nerve, etc., are formed? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Again? How is this related? By the time my ' daughter / son ' was in a state where they could be ' killed ', no surrogate mother would have the right to end their life. If a child is not breast fed, what does this then make the child in your eyes? I don't really think I need to add to this particular contradiction of yours. In some cases, absolutely. It happens all the time. In every case - of course not. The difference, however, is that an adult on a ventilator has already had a mental existence. In the case of abortion, this isn't the case - you're not ' taking away ' because there is nothing to take in the first place.

So a bit of advice for you : follow you own advice and read everything other people say to understand exactly what they are saying. That way you will avoid making yourself look both rude and stupid at the same time. Have a nice life now. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If you would have read and understood gthe context of what I said everything. First post was saying how once a fetus ebgins replcaiting its own uniques DNA it is it's own entity. Jito bear refuted saying eggs and sperm had dna. I pointed out eys they did but they weren't the fetus ' dna. The Fetus creates dna based on theirs. Duo said the same thing. You said the same thing. Just so you know. I'm aware of waht I've stated but it was apparent you were not aware of that. Hence the redundancy of the post.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>From the part of the world I come from, what you are doing is known as " lying ". Not sure what you call it. You claimed that the egg's DNA was different to its mother's DNA. You now claiming you instead said that " once a fetus ebgins replcaiting its own uniques DNA it is it's own entity ". You didn't state such a thing until now. Why claim otherwise? Pride is a pathetic thing at times. All you have to say is " Oh well, that idea didn't work " and all would be fine and people would think more highly of you. Instead you dig yourself into a hole of changing stories until you bury yourself in your own lies and contradictions simply to avoid admitting you made a small mistake. Sad. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>REad my response to jito bear. You didn't understand. Probably becaue you didn't udnerstand two things. We can't replicate dna that is not our own. So once dna is created that isn't ours then it's a separate entity. Sperm we creat and eggs we creat is our dna still. Put together they create a different entity that replicates its own different than both teh mother and father but with similarities of both. Quote me where I contradicted this.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>The actual problem is that I understand the topic too well, where as you are casting about in the dark making yourself look ever more silly with every post you make... Ever had a cold? Those symptoms were a direct result of you replicating the virus ' DNA along with your own. We most certainly can replicate DNA that is not our own. You cannot double up an instance of your own egg / sperm DNA to make a copy of your own DNA. They are different from your own DNA : they are a new DNA entity. The new DNA entity comes into existence when the egg / sperm is created. I appreciate that you cannot accept this as it destroys your original argument and you are too proud to accept you are wrong, but it remains fact none the less. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Using viruses as an example of how we produce dna that isn't our own is like saying men can fly, just need an ariplane. Viruses are parasites. It's like saying people can produce maggots. Viruses like babies use our resources to rpoduce their own dna. Physiologically we do not produce dna that isn't our own. But literally you're right we can replicate dna not our own. Labortories do it with cloning and genetic engineering. If you took my argument as literal then you are right. Even though people can tell I was using it in terms of physiology. That was my original argument. Read the beginning of the post. Please someone help him out.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Moggots are detritovores, not parasites. Wrong again. That is exactly what we do when we produce eggs and sperm. Eggs and sperm have to be guarded by various nurse cells as our immune system would attack them otherwise. Physiologically they most certainly are different. No it was not your original argument. Please stop lying, it's irritating and pathetic to watch. You claimed that the DNA of eggs and sperm are the same as that of the parent then proceed to claim " that was my original argument " every time someone states the opposite. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I never claimed they were parasites. It was an analogy. They contain our DNA. Here's the deal : You have your own set of DNA. This DNA contains a private, one of a kind set of genetics. Half of your DNA came from your biological mother and half from your biological father. Your mother's DNA was inside what we refer to as a woman's egg, or ovum, while your father's DNA was inside his sperm. After sexual intercourse one of your father's sperm met your mother's egg. During this meeting that started your life, the two haploid DNA forms combined and created a brand new set of DNA, which was then in diploid form. So there you were, a genetically unique biological human person in just one single cell. Weird, I know. http://www.tnhonline.com/news/2004/0...n-669600.shtml It was my original argument. It's alright. Saying ti wasn't doesn't change that it was. I'm done arguing wiht that. You have not shown me that I contradict myself.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>So it was a **** analogy. Fair enough. You almost have it right. You did not have your mother's DNA in the egg and your father's DNA in the sperm though ; you had a unique subset of their DNA. Every sperm and egg has a slightly different set of DNA from other sperm / eggs which are varying sets of just half of the mother's / father's own DNA. The brand new DNA comes into existence when the egg / sperm is created. I predict you will respond " that's what I said " as you sadly will not stop and listen and instead just assume you understand when you don't. Incidently to further confuse the issue for you, care to comment on twins? When do their lifes start? At fertilization or when the zygote or embryo splits? So to summarise your original argument : " Because a new unique set of DNA is formed in the unfertilized egg and the sperm, different from the DNA of both the mother and father, and because twins share identical DNA, the act of the egg becoming fertilized and two unique stes of DNA coming together clearly can be seen as the start of a new life from the point of view of DNA " Is that what you are saying?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7196_55_53__57_64_65_69_72_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Me, adopt children, and would you have them starve to death, I'm too young. Those " scribblings " are the basis of English Common Law, only an illiterate dolt wouldn't know that. Stop repeating yourself like a broken record, " why should a bureaucrat / government decide, " for the final time, it isn't a woman's right to determine when to murder children. If the woman didn't want children at that moment, don't have sex or adopt it out, there are waiting lists to get children, not the other way around. P.S. When I do grow older I may adopt children, depending upon my circumstances, if not then maybe I'll help their lives in other ways.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I'll find the Ten Commandments ( any one of the many versions ) in English Common Law? Really? Show me. Who are you to determine whether abortion is murder? The " don't have sex " argument is a bit tardy if she's already pregnant, isn't it? I'll counter the tardy objection with : she could use birth control. Why didn't you mention this option? I bet you're opposed to that, aren't you? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Y'all keep repeating the same arguments over and over, I've already refuted them. I guess it is true that you can lead a camel to water but you can't make him take a drink. I wouldn't be defining murder, my elected officials would be, and defining what constitutes any crime is and what the punishment should be is one of the primary purposes of government. I'm not responding unless you come up with something new.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That's not water, that's a mirage of wishful thinking. I'm quite happy not gulping down buckets of sand. You should try it sometime. You've refuted nothing. You say your beliefs come from the Bible. I show that your beliefs are contradicted by the Bible. Your response is as vacuous as your position, and then you ignore my subsequent comments. You get pro-abortion Bible quotes thrown at you every day? Why have you no response for that? Why have you no response to the question of where Jesus / God rescinded this law? Why do you not answer the questions of why, if it is none of your business, you make it your business? Why don't you respond to my question of whether you are against contraception? The answer is : you have no answer. You have your beliefs, which have been pounded into your brain in such a way that you truly believe that the Bible backs you up. It doesn't. Perhaps you think you're a good Christian. Do you stone people who work on the sabbath? Do you punish smart-mouthed offspring with death? Do you pray only in your closet? If not, you're not a good enough Christian. Read the Bible. It'll surprise you. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Jesus said himself " let who has not sin cast the first stone " when referring to an adulterous woman so you're the one who forgot to read the new testament. Say what verse promotes abortion.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So you think I'm an adulterous woman? Is that the best you can come up with? I did, except that I left out the book and chapter : Hosea 13. Or at least, this shows that God causes abortions. If you want promotion of abortion, try Numbers 5 : And, in case you wanted Biblical confirmation that a fetus is not regarded as a life, here's Exodus 21 : In a world where the law is life for life, when the woman is caused to miscarry but not otherwise injured, the guilty party merely pays a fine. But you're still not supporting your points. Can you show where this pro-abortion law is rescinded by Jesus? Hmmm? Can you answer any of the other questions you've been posed? Or will you just keep running away and calling me names? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>First, the second one says there is punishment for merely for causing infertility, hardly promoting abortion. The first one, if the woman is guilty, she becomes infertile, which was the punishment since Genesis for women who committed adultery, hardly promoting abortion. Moreover it shows that the Hebrews were unique in their love of children in the ancient world.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-6496_4_3__6_11_14_18_21_30_39_45_52_54_56_57_58_60_63_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>sounds good. This is wrong. You yourself find " mental existence " to be " sacred ' in a way. There is no rational argument for mental existence being the point of obtaining rights... no matter how hard any of us try :p You just stated a moral proclamation... ( underlined ) This, in a way, is another moral proclamation. You feel mental existence is of importance for existing ( or being of value ). I'm not saying that is wrong or bad ( well... I do say that but just not right now :p ) but it is a moral stance. It logically follows from the moral foundation set up but you made to important claims or " proclamations " as you called it. 1 ) Treat others as you wish to be treated ( golden rule ) and 2 ) Mental existence is required to have value My morality was already nicely summed up by you ( atleast part of it )<br><b> S2:1-  </b>We're legally dead when we no longer mentally exist ( hence the term " brain-dead " ), so there is no logical reason to set the beginning point as anything other than the start of the mental existence. Just as people who are dead and without mental existence do not have the ability to obtain rights, a collection of human cells without a mental existence cannot obtain rights. I also notice you have resorted to attacking other people's views rather than following the topic of the thread, which is to share YOUR views. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>This assumes brain-dead is a logical choice to consider one dead. Even so, it proves nothing about when life begins. What says they have to be the same? This is a classic example of a conclusion not following from the premise. yeah, that is correct.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You have some evidence to support another conclusion of when one is dead? Because in medical definitions, the definition is exactly what I said ( methinks you don't have an argument here ). It might not prove it to you, but to most rational and logially thinking people it would. And this here shows exactly what type of a person you are. Why don't you post as to the topic of the thread instead of trying to start arguments? It's really sickening. ON the subject of your starting arguments, I notice you selectively ignored my view that I posted. Couldn't come up with an? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I don't doubt that brain-dead means dead but I do doubt that can therefore infer that life means " brain alive "... even you don't believe this as it has to be more than just a brain substance. well, I thought Another Opinion covered my belief fairly well so why bother? There is always the option not to respond to me. Actually I didn't even read it ( and doubt I ever will ). Don't get all worked up over it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Again, I said most rational and logical people would. I didn't say you would. And I am sure you really did read through it, you just couldn't come up with a response, but whatever. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>And can you show this to be true? I doubt it. Besides, it doesn't even make logical sense. It is a rational as saying " because the sky is blue people sing on Sunday ". It would be hard to come up with a response to something you don't read.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>That's the most retarted thing I've ever heard. But then again, you aren't one for logic, especially when you bring this ridiculous " quasianalogy " into the discussion. What I am saying makes a hell of a lot more logical sense than your " analogy. Mine actually has logic in it : If a person's mental existence ends ( brain death - defined my the medical field ) they are considered dead. It is logical that if mental existence begins ( start of brain activity and consciousness ) they are now alive. And again, I wouldn't expect you to understand logic if it hit you in the face. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Other than you spelling " retarded " wrong for the third or fourth time in a row... like the logic of the ending point having to be the opposite of the beginning point? I'm going to take a stab here and say you are probably in the 8 or 9th grade ( not that this is a bad thing ) because anyone who has taken a day of a logic class would understand how your statement makes no sense. If you finish at the finish line does that mean you start at the same line? In your world it always does...<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Um, I spelled it wrong TWICE. I didn't have time to bother with a spellchecker, I was just typing what formed in my mind. My apoligies to have upset you oh high and mighty one. I've noticed that when you don't have an argument you begin to quibble over some minor misspellings, or some dictionary definition ( which you seem to hold as your Bible ). Hm, well, sorry, you're stabbing rather wildly, in fact, you ended up stabbing yourself. I happen to be a twenty-year-old in my sophomore year of college at Colorado School of Mines ( engineering and science school in case you haven't heard of it ). I won't bother to hazard a guess at your age, as guesses base on internet discussion are notoriously inaccurate ( as you just proved ). <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Yet it wasn't semantics... it was a very good and important point. The point was to show that your idea of when death ends really isn't just " brain dead " but rather " brain dead with no recovery ". The key difference is that if you could recover from no brain then perhaps you wouldn't call this person " dead ". You failed to address this. I normally could care less how you spell something but if you claim my post is " retarted " then it certainly presents irony that has to be pointed out. College student doesn't surprise me much either actually. I wasn't trying to insult as I don't find anything wrong with our younger crowd other than their limited view of the world ( Zachvac is pretty good about this though ). But since you are in college I suggest taking a logic course ( philosophy department normally ) as you will understand why the conclusion you come up with does not follow from the premise. Furthermore, as I stated above ( and as Phyllis stated ), you make a key assumption that is false. Your logic tries to say brain dead therefore dead and then not brain dead therefore not dead. While fine this doesn't exactly say when " life " begins is in fact false anyway. The fetus is certainly not dead.. wouldn't you agree?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Its cells are certainly living ( although, the same is true for a recently deceased person, so your argument is a little flimsy there as well ), but it is not mentally living. Oh, maybe it will make you think twice before trying to make guesses on the age of posters. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>so what? The discussion is about whether or not death being at death of the brain makes life when the brain forms. I state that there is no logic that would ever get that conclusion as it makes no sense. You can say " if the end is here the beginning was the opposite of here ". Furthermore, how much of the brain has to be there? Just the " mentally existing " part? What defines that? ( Another Opinion please refrain from answering the last part of this question )<br><b> S2:7-  </b>Never said there had to be a fully formed brain. Just enough to produce mental activity and consciousness. Oh, and maybe you should learn a little bit about this one guy called William of Ockham, and his razor :), because that is what supports my view. I notice you still haven't expressed yours ( which is the point of the thread ), and continue to just attack other views. <br><b>S1:8-  </b>What do you mean by consciousness? Self-awareness or something else? what? How does that even remotely relate to this? Furthermore, the easiest idea in this case would be to assume life begins at conception.<br><b> S2:8-  </b>Sorry, but the simplest assumption is that actual human life begins at the beginning of mental activity. Once again you have not stated your actual opinion, just attacked others. <br><b>S1:9-  </b>Well I disagree with that. You also keep changing the subject. The question was regarding the logic behind the point of death and whether or not that can determine the point of life. Can you present some form of logic that suggests this is true or not? As for my opinion on morality... there is an absolute right and wrong. Happy?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3677_26_21__28_29_30_35_36_38_39_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Oops. Willow didn't log off. That last post was mine. Sorry.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Willow and Nurglitch share the same computer? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No, we each have our own, but something we use each other's computers. I hope you're monogamous, because otherwise you're not only having risky unprotected sex, but you're being a risky partner yourself. Gays having unprotected sex with monogamous parters is as risky as straights having unprotected sex with monogamous partners, none.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I've had the same partner for 3 decades. I cal her " my wife ". Not true. Gay men use an orifice that is teeming with germs that I don't. They're far more likely to get an STD than a straight man and woman in a monogomous relationship EVEN if the relationship is also monogomous. Facts IS facts. :) <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Good to hear. This may surprise you but not all gay sex is anal sex. There's also oral sex and mutual masturbation. Secondly unless you're into scat, which seems to be another fetish that doesn't respect gay / straight boundaries, you should be clean as a whistle down there. So I'm rather curious as to what you claim that I can get from sex with another man that I can't get from sex with a woman, in terms of sexually transmitted diseases. I don't really see how you can object to homosexuality on grounds of sexual acts, considering that a man and a woman can do pretty much everything two men or two women can do together. In that case you're not objecting to homosexuality but rather to particular sex acts.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Without getting graphic, what about the inside? Are you telling me that you're clean as a whistle inside as well? lymphogranuloma venereum ( LGV ), GBS, to name a couple. My personal objection to homosexuality is based on my religious beliefs AND health concerns. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Yeah, pretty much. Reading Dan Savage's sex-advice column was how I found out that some people sometimes experience something called ' santorum ', a frothy mix of lube and fecal matter, as a byproduct of anal sex. Can't say I've ever had that happen to me and I can imagine that people who experience it should probably clean themselves more carefully, change their diet, and remember to relieve themselves at least an hour before engaging in anal play. This may surprise you, but you can get LGV from opposite sex partners, especially in the tropics. Likewise so-called " gay bowel syndrome ", GBS, is merely a collection of infections that you can also get from opposite sex partners such Shigella, Giardia, Campylobacter-like organisms, Entamoeba, Chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis. So, do you actually know any STDs that are exclusive to homosexuals? Except that there are no particular health concerns that gay people have that straight people don't share, and your religious beliefs are your own which you have no legal or moral right to force others to hold.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>On that note, I think that I'll gracefully bow out of this discussion before I toss my dinner. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>So you're unable to discuss health concerns about particular sex acts, and therefore unable to back up your claims about the health impact of gay sex? I think it's really important to be able to discuss these things in a mature and adult fashion, especially when someone makes claims about them. So far I've pointed out that anal sex is neither restricted to gays, nor the primary sex act of gays, nor as unhygenic as has been claimed. However I would still like to hear about what STDs you think are exclusive to homosexuals, given that neither LGV or " GBS " are.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-745_428_427__430_432_433_435_442_446_448_454_464_468_481_483_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Wrong.

Keeping slaves in the first place was a violation of it. If you can't figure it out why should I tell you. You should have seen it by the context of what I've been saying all along.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Seems like we    ve debated this point before. The one where you told me slaves were illegal because    All men are created equal    was in the constitution and I pointed out to you that it was not in the constitution but that the constitution specifically addressed how to count slaves in determining representation and left slavery laws to the individual states. In addition court cases clearly showed that slavery was legal. Since slaves were definitely legal property, it was legal to kill them. Oh I can figure it out all right. If you address the subject you will be backed into a corner you can    t get out of except by brushing it off as irrelevant. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>They were breaking the intent of their own laws. Either their laws apply to all or they apply to none. There was much hypocrisy in early American and there is still some today. If you had figured it out then why did you ask?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>What law are you talking about when you say    intent of their own laws   ? I haven    t seen a law that gave slaves any rights when our country was founded. I    ve seen several that denied them rights. So where was the intent? Don    t know where you came up with that as they obviously did apply to some and not to all. In our country the courts interpret the meaning of a law in case there is any doubt.

I wanted you to back yourself into a corner. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Redundant discussion.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Good, then I'll take that as a concession that you believe killing slaves was not murder since it was legal. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>What you haven't realized is that when they freed the slaves and gave women the right to choose they were correcting two old errors.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Since we were correcting a wrong, you must believe that even though it was legal to kill slaves, it was morally wrong because they were human beings, right? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Still met the legal definition as well, even if they choose to ignore it.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>I don't understand what you just said.

I am waiting for you to show me some statement in our Constitution or our Bill of Rights that shows the intent of our Constitution or our Bill of Rights made state laws regarding the killing of slaves as void.

We're just protecting your reproductive rights, you really haven't had them all that long. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I don't want you to protect such reproductive rights! I'm getting annoyed at you as a person, and that's not good. Therefore, since you have your mind set and you have your way of debating, I more or less had enough arguing when it goes no where. :)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You want to be nothing more than property, again? With no say at all about your own body? Amazing. It's not my fault that you don't realize what you want to give up. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If that's the way you insist upon putting it, sure. But that's not at all what I mean, and abortion being legal does not equal women being property. Are you saying that I'm giving up my rights to my body, or that I'm giving up a wonderful conversation with you? ;)<br><b> S2:3-  </b>But abortion being illegal does. If you don't have a say in you own reproductive rights as an adult than you're no different than livestock. Both. :) <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Sorry, I meant if abortion was illegal. So abortion being illegal would reduce me to being as low as livestock??! Pardon me, but where on earth do you get these ideas? lol! I don't know if I like you or not. Just beware. I can get annoyed sometimes ;) Okay, bring it on. ( remember, I'm stubborn too, and I believe what I say on abortion all the way. )<br><b> S2:4-  </b>It was what you would have been thought of as when women didn't have a say in their own bodies, though the actual livestock had more value to the farmer. If you want to choose to negate your rights that is your choice, but you can't decide for other women either. This may be a too personal question, but do you have sex? If so are you willing to not have sex unless it is to have a baby? Since sex is only for reproduction according to many Christians and birth control is a sin. What would you do if after they managed to outlaw abortions they next worked to outlaw pre-marital sex again as well, what they use to call fornication? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I don't care what I would have been thought as, we are past that time in life, and banning abortion will NOT bring that time back. Besides, whose fault would it be if that time did come back? Not the woman's fault. No, she's not the one treating herself like livestock, it's the man. For the first thing, what if the majority ruled against abortion? Three things : No, I don't have sex. Who said I'm a Christian? And no, the Christians who think that sex is only for reproduction are wrong. I don't think most Christians think that way at all. You were raised ( or got your beliefs elsewhere somehow ) with some weird ideas, you know?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Remember, these are the people who want to bring back the so-called " good old days ". well that was what they were like, when only men had any real rights and freedoms, and mostly if they were white and of the " proper " belief as well. As to your second point, exactly. Then the so-called " Good old days " will come back as well and it would mean that the USA is degrading. Who are you to say that since to them you're only a woman. I was raised in an environment of traditional Christian values. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Just how long ago are you talking with the " good old days, " anyway? Also, legalizing abortion has nothing to do with whites and blacks and other races of humans. It also has nothing to do with the equality of women and men now. Women aren't fighting in Iraq because abortion is legal. Women aren't senators and governors and in the Supreme Court because abortion is legal. All that didn't happen because abortion was illegal either. What about the women in the positions I listed who are pro-life? They aren't there just because men decided women have the right for abortions! Reeeeaaally, huh? As for as I know, the majority has the say in most things, and that doesn't mean that every time the majority rules against something that others don't like that everything is degrading. I didn't say I wasn't a Christian, did I? Which religion / church were you brought up in?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Back before women got the vote. To many of them things went down hill from there. :) Didn't say that it did. Yes, it does. Unless you have the right to choice all others will be next to go. When it involves the negation of a natural right than it is a degradation. Didn't say that you weren't either. That of the majority of Christians in the world. Roman Catholic. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>Things went downhill after they could vote?? Also, they could vote in 1920. 1920! That's back right after the " good old days "? You DO know that's a long time ago, and many things have changed since then, don't you. I certainly hope so. You had said something about " blacks " in your post. Abortion doesn't make men and women equal. Women started to vote before abortion was legal. We did have rights before then. Abortion is a natural right, huh? That's irrelevant. Just was curious. :) By the way, you had asked, " who is raised in a pro-death household, " in the thread I started. I want to reply on it here : I believe everyone who is pro-choice.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>It has taken much hard work over the years. Many of your rights have come about quite recently, though. When? Didn't say that it did, since it is solely a woman's right. Not as many as you've gotten since it became legal. The right to choose is. You brought it up. :) You would be quite wrong since it seems that most of those who are against abortions support the killing of persons instead.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-6761_2_1__4_5_6_10_12_14_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>" WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court upheld the nationwide ban on a controversial abortion procedure Wednesday, handing abortion opponents the long-awaited victory they expected from a more conservative bench. The 5 - 4 ruling said the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act that Congress passed and President Bush signed into law in 2003 does not violate a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. The opponents of the act " have not demonstrated that the Act would be unconstitutional in a large fraction of relevant cases, " Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion. " http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070418/...59UoFloUOs0NUE It will interesting to see how quickly all these people here who have, at various times, said they aren't really for late term abortions will applaud this ruling.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>If the partial birth abortion procedure was only outlawed in the third trimester and if it allowed for the exceptions of risk to mother's life, health, etc., then it would be fine. However, reading your article, it doesn't look like the mother's health exception is being honored. Quoting from your link : The numbers of women for whom this procedure is the only viable one may be small, but I think exceptions need to be granted them if that is the only way for them to avoid serious health risks. Do you personally think that serious risk to women's health is not a viable exception to abortion restrictions? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>A lot of people have taken issue with " the woman's health " phrase as a caveat due to the fact it is so vague. I tend to think it is too vague to be reasonable. If specific standards were put in place as to determine at what point such a phrase is violated, then I might be more open to it. Because " health of the mother " could be so wide-open to interpretation, it would be an allowance for abortion that would basically have no meaning and significance. And that is, I think, one reason the pro-choice lobby wanted such phraseology. Yeah, I certainly think it's a good ruling. IMO there is no reason ( other than the life of the mother ) to do such a horrible thing to a late-term fetus.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I agree that the mother's health exception is vaguely worded and that vagueness can be a problem. Right now, it seems like we have a choice of two extremes - either grant the health exception for any health risk or don't grant it at all. Of those two extremes, I would rather err on the side of allowing it and let people's consciences decide. As to the idea of trying to narrow down that health risk exception, I had set up a thread specifically for that purpose. I, for one, thought that the health exception should cover severe health risks ( ex. of paralysis, severe heart trouble risking an early death, mental health risking suicide, etc. ) but not everyday health risks associated with normal pregnancies. It is the gray region in between that is tricky and I had opened that thread to hear people's opinions on it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Sorry I missed your thread on that. It sounds like you are mainly concerned with health issues that could very potentially lead to the mother's death and or / complete debilitation ( like paralysis ), and I'd be much more open to that. But as you said, we have two extremes to choose from, and SCOTUS chose the one that doesn't take into account the woman's health for this particular procedure. I'd also add that because this is a late term procedure, if health is the reason to not take the baby to term, then caesarian delivery very well might be an option, in many cases.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I agree that all other reasonably safe options ( such as caesarian delivery, in womb operations, etc. ) should be looked into before resorting to abortion in that third trimester. As with the example of the friend of jitobear, sometimes there is just not a reasonably safe option for a particular woman since her conditions might not allow those alternate procedures. As for the question of limits on the health exception, yes, the exceptions that are clearer to me are the ones that could ultimately lead to the mother's death or complete debilitation. However, there is also a gray region that I am undecided on. For example : - What if the pregnancy would lead to less critical loss - such as the loss of use of her legs or arms? What about one limb - such as the use of one arm? - What if the pregnancy would give a medium chance of loss - such as a 20% chance of paralysis? The gray region is harder to quantify and the moral balance gets trickier. Perhaps that is why this issue hasn't really been addressed specifically in law. Where decisions in morally gray regions are concerned, it is too easy to criticize them and politically unwise to venture into that territory. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>These are all very specific situations, and all ones that are something to think about. Crafting abortion law that would cover every conceivable circumstance would be very difficult and tedious, not to mention difficult to follow. I guess a vague statement is the only real option at all, and so I think it's always going to come down to deciding whether we want to simply include the " health of the mother " as a caveat or not. Personally, I think it's always going to be too vague, and there's really little that can be done about that.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>We also have the option of leaving it up to a judge who follows certain general guidelines or set up some loose guidelines that at least narrow that health exception down ( ex. limiting it to permanent damage, or permanent damage of a particular degree, etc. ). I just don't think that this issue has been addressed enough yet. Discussions on forums such as this could help narrow down that health exception definition.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8817_5_4__6_7_13_15_18_20_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I believe there should be laws that only trained, licensed, medical professionals conduct abortions.

" <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Thats a very good question. To be honest - I would prefer no legislation period - but I would not get up in arms about a late term restriction like I described because 1 ) a fetus could very well survive outside of the mom at that point, 2 ) most reputable doctors won't conduct an abortion at that stage without a legitimate medical reason anyway.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I see,... so ( to you ) it's not like the child has a right to it's life or anything like that.

I am aware what pro-life advocates got presented to congress. I also know that there are doctors that disagree.

The readers can ( and will ) decide for themselves which of our positions ( if any ) will give them cause to reflect or rethink their own positions. I think that's good enough for any forum,... isn't it? Interesting,... can you please tell me of any one situation where it is more beneficial for a woman's physical health to remove her baby from her DEAD by way of the procedure known as " partial birth abortion " as opposed to surgically removing the baby alive? Please be clear on how killing the child is more of a benefit to the mother than delivering it alive would be. ( waiting patiently ) <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Somebody called me " he " - just wanted to clarify. I already answered this. That was directed at Cyberateos - not you. Yep My understanding is that late term aLate term abortion is extremely rare and generally done to remove a fetus that is not viable. I have a friend who has a serious heart condition that makes any kind of surgery extremely risky. She is a mother of two - it would be ludicrous for her to undergo a surgery that could kill her so as to not perform a D & E to remove fetus that isn't viable. Just one story there. But I am not a doctor, nor ( I suspect ) are you. As I said - leave it to them.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>So far the medical community is remiss in providing even one case where a " partial birth " abortion has any advantage over any other procedure. Not even in cases such as the one you described. You have to understand the procedure itself to understand why that is. The baby is pulled out of the womb " breech. " It is turned in the womb to accomplish this. It also has to be turned so that it is " face down " ( so the dr. can later poke a hole in the base of his / her skull and suck out the brain. ) Forced breech birth of all but the head,... Not much healthy for an already traumatized mom. It's no less traumatic than delivering the baby alive. However! ( and just in case you didn't know ) There is in fact a " life of the mother exception. " It's just never going to be put to the test because the procedure itself is simply that barbaric and un-necessary for the health of the mother to be affectively addressed using other ( less traumatic ) means.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8817_57_54__61_62_67_68_78_79_86_87_88_91_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I'm not quite sure how you come up with that point since most Americans are Christian and more than half of Americans are pro-choice. I suspect that you are creating a circular definition here - i.e. A Christian is, by your definition, one that is pro-life. If you like circular definitions, then so be it, but your definition would be ignored as illogical by the large percentage of Christians that ARE pro-choice, as well as by myself.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Such is the beliefs of not only Esdraelon,... but seemingly a large number of those who find elective abortion as an affront to their religious doctrine. The reactions to your comments should have been expected, Esdraelon. Were they? I wonder if you would consider reading my views on religion and politics ( posted here ) and maybe telling me what you think. As for a response to your other responders? I have linked to a post which shows my own outrage with ESD's remarks above,.... But I also have to ask what seems to me to be an obvious question ; " How can you so seriously feign being outraged at Esd's " playing God " and appointing him / herself as the final say in who is and who is not a " Christian? " Even as you yourselves take on that role as you deny the status of " personhood " to pre-birth children? " I disagree with Esd's comments as much as you guys do,... but at least no-one is killed or denied their basic rights as a result of His / Her denials. The same can not be said for yours. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Heck, if the fetus considers him / herself a person, then he is a person in my eyes! Of course, he would need a mind to be able to consider him / herself a person...<br><b> S2:2-  </b>-- God So much for arguing for someone else's rights by proxy, huh. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>YOU were the one making the comparison to whether or not people can consider themselves Christian despite being pro-choice. It was simply a logical extention of that comparison. Of course, my own view of personhood doesn't require a mind to be as advanced as would be needed to recognize itself as a person. I just require ANY human mind - no matter how rudimentary - to logically see a living entity as a person.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>" I just require " = " God wannabe " <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Each of us - both you and I included - have the right to our own views based on what we have found to be logical. Obviously, you and I disagree on the definition of person. That doesn't mean that either of us is " playing God " by holding that opinion. We could only be accused of playing God if we expected everyone else to agree with us because of an inherent feeling of superiority instead of through force of arguement. I always present my arguements and defend them point by point without running away from an uncomfortable point. That is not playing God. That is simply the process of engaging in debate. Do you think that people do not have the right to their own opinion? If so, then you are living in the wrong country.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No AO, I agree with the definition of " person " as it applies to pre-birth children. If I had the time I would link to them yet again. You are the one who places a higher standard ( brain activity ) that is not a requirment of the definition " human being. " So it is in that respect that YOU are playing God. A human fetus is BY DEFINITION a " human individual being. " There is no requirment in the definition for an ability to think or feel pain. Gotta go,.. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>We've already had these discussions on semantics in another thread and they have led nowhere so I have no desire to repeat them over again. Readers can judge each of our arguements on this subject for themselves by reading those earlier threads.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Semantics? While I take offense at your claiming we are only arguing semantics ; I do agree with you on one thing... Readers should read the earlier threads. Words have definitive meanings. Human, being, person, begin, etc. Each reader who truly cares about the issue should take the time an avail themselves of all the sources for information they can find, and educate themselves on what the meanings of those words are, and how those words apply to the beginnings of a new child's life and their right to the life they are living. Can we at least agree on that much? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>As people who know how to use dictionaries realize, words have multiple meanings where you have to look up the meaning most suitable to the context in which you are trying to use the word. These are basic concepts known by most people starting in early school years that you often fail to grasp, as shown by your posts. Your posts have shown that, first, you try to force the definition from one context to apply to another context and, second, you fail to fully defend your interpretation of the definition. Readers will be able to judge for themselves...<br><b> S2:6-  </b>The words mean what they mean. The facts are what they are. I think we both agree on that and I'm hoping you have no problem with encouraging others to educate themselves on what the facts are.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-2344_46_42__47_48_49_50_52_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I keep hearing you claim that the government has no " right " to use someone's body against their will, but you're argument is patently false.

That nebulous term is an invitation to abuse, IMO. Quite the contrary, I believe highly in helping those in need. That's what CHARITY is for, NOT government. That's my beef.

Considering that the top 50% of wage earners ( majority are Republican ) pay 96% of all income taxes, you're not far from wrong. :p But that's not the point. The Federal Gov't has no business being in the business of charity. Charity should NEVER be coerced. It should be freely given to those charities that the donor deems worthy.

You simply cannot argue the point that I was making so you headed down a rabbit trail trying to derail my argument that " pro choice is not pro child " which I posted the physiology information to simply support my claim that these are babies and not some amorphous blob of tissue which is what the abortion advocates will claim so as to make it seem okay to kill a human before they exit the womb.

If my already born family starves because I can't work an abortion would certainly be pro-family. If a pregnancy will endanger my life and leave my child motherless - an abortion could be pro-family. It could also be pro-child when you consider the possibility of multiple children. I am know my examples are possibly the extremes, but I felt inclined to answer. By the way - hello folks - I have been out awhile. Life got busy and tough for a bit. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>If you will please note, I have already been very careful to consider the health and safety of the mother. Please reread my posts. Some folks have abortions simply because they are too lazy to use birth control or too stupid to simply not have sex. That is not true in all cases and I think I already made that clear. I have trivialized nothing. Others trivialize the potential for life within them. Please stop trivializing that. Please don't call it " just a lump of tissue " that is simply not true. EF<br><b> S2:2-  </b>When you consider any cisrcumstance in a woman's except her health - " incovenience " or " laziness " or " stupidity " you do trivialize women. Life is not that simple. For starters one area that lifers continue to overlook is FINANCIAL. Pregnancies are EXPENSIVE. Doctors - new clothes - meds - hospital stays - potentail loss of work leading to unpayed bills, lost homes, etc. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Financial difficulties are overcome almost everyday. Do you think that because it is expensive to have a vasectomy that some men should not do that? I see a lot of men and women buying cars they cannot afford. Please just admit that some women ( and men ) make a stupid choice which leads to pregnancy. I never said they were all that way and your characterization of me in that vein is unfair, illogical, and in bad taste. EF<br><b> S2:3-  </b>And people starve every day. Even in the US. Not in my neighborhood. Nor in the five years I lived in poorest state in this country. I am not talking about things being tight for awhile. I am talking about being able to feed yourself - or get to a doctor when you are pregnant. Are you kidding - people do stupid stuff all the time. Irresponsbility ticks me off, too. ( But not as much as a governments, churches and neo-cons making major medical decisions for strangers without their input ). So is was your implication that abortion for any reason outside of ones health is a " convenience " matter. But I don't really wanna battle with you anyway. You seem more interested in education than imposition - and I am all for that. :) <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I never intended to say that abortion is always a matter of convenience. I appreciate your willingness to consider my full position. I am still opposed to abortion in a later term. I am opposed to some abortion procedures completely. I also believe women need to be told about the possibilities. I also believe Children are not able to clearly make that decision. I also believe certain abortion clinics are not held accountable as they should be. I am christian and I am also a TRUE conservative ( I don't really fit the neo con mold ). I would not judge a person who decides to have an abortion. I would want to counsel them that it is a very grave decision and that they may regret it and that they should consider other alternatives if possible. That is my stance.

Furthermore, my argument does hold up. Just because two people can share one body, or the same DNA, it is not true to say their lives did not begin at conception<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Nobody can prove either way what a " person " is because that term has not been strictly defined by society. That is part of what we are all arguing here in the abortion debate. I define person as a human with mental existence. You define it another way. Neither of us has proof because proof is irrelevant where terms such as " person " that have no clear definition are concerned. Either way, the relevance of when a " person " starts is when rights start. I have given my reasons about why I think rights are given in the first place and how that relates to the minimum requirements for those rights ( i.e. mental existence ). I still have to hear from you about the reasons behind our giving rights and when, based on those reasons, rights should start. This is another one of those examples of points which I have brought up which you have ignored. If you do not wish to continue to be criticized for your debating style, then address the points which your opponents bring up. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>So you are claiming things with no facts to prove them. Too bad, you lose. Their lives still began then.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You are missing the point again. Neither of us win and neither of us lose when it comes to the definition of the word " person " since there IS no clear definition. I challenge you to answer this question directly : Do you think there is a clearly defined and widely accepted definition of the word " person "? If so, give a link to show the definition and its widespread acceptance. You can't? No surprise. That is because there IS no universally accepted viewpoint on when a " person " starts. That is why we are debating it, along with its influence on rights. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So stop claiming and speaking from a perspective that suggests you do.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I am stating my opinion about my meaning behind the word person, just like you have a right to your view as well. If you think that I said that my definition is the universally accepted definition, then quote me. Indeed, I have mentioned many times - in this thread and others - that the term " person " is not well defined and is something we are trying to debate. Also, I asked you : Do you think there is a clearly defined and widely accepted definition of the word " person "? If so, give a link to show the definition and its widespread acceptance. Does that mean that you accept that your definition of the word " person " is also not universally acknowledged? As for stating opinions on that definition and the rights behind it, it is not enough to make a statement. One has to give ones reasons behind it if one wants to be at all convincing. I have stated that I think people begin at mental existence and that is when we should first get rights, and I HAVE given my detailed reasons behind that view. I am still waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting for you to give your DETAILED reasons behind why you think a person starts at conception and deserves rights then. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So I was right to claim that your life started at conception, since this is true, whereas your opinion is just a lonely opinion. I have said many times now, how many more times do I need to do this : per   son ( p   r'sn ) n. A living human.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-4586_25_24__26_27_28_29_31_32_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No, it's simply that people often claim the existence of some sort of ' external world ' is proved, when all statements about matter are simply statements about how our sense data is ordered.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yes, in the absolute sense, the existence of the ' external world ' is not proved. However, in the practical sense, all of us, including yourself, live as if the external world is proved and nothing has proven us wrong yet. Every experience we and all humanity have had is consistent with that, so we have no reason to doubt the existence of the external world. Ultimately, it would be extremely arrogant for any of us to believe that existence is only composed of our own minds. I am guessing that your doubts are simply doubts as to what that external world is really composed of and whether our senses are reading it correctly. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>To be fair, all our experiences are also consistent with other scenarios, such as demonic deception, that we find less palatble, or seem more unrealistic. I think the claim that it would be ' arrogant ' to think that existence is our own minds is strange... when trying to reach truth this shouldn't be a consideration. An atheist might call a religious person arrogant for thinking that the supreme being cares about them, and a religious person might call an atheist arrogant for ' denying God ' or ' thinking there's nothing higher than them '. The philosophic position of solipsism is not the same as mere arrogance, although I know some who claim one who are merely the other.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>However, there is nothing in our experiences which suggests that it is a demonic deception. As long as there is nothing to support it, it remains one of an infinite number of possible theories. We generally have to work with what we have. Demonic posession also assumes an external existence ( namely, at least the existence of the demon ), so does the Matrix scenario ( in the existence of the machine world ). The only way that an external world would not exist - only our own single and solitary mind - would be if we were self-deceiving and self-created ( or always existed ) - essentially god-like characteristics which, yes, I still would consider arrogant. I am not saying that the idea of alternate versions of existence is an arrogant idea, just the idea that we are the only thing that exists is arrogant since its possibility would assume god-like qualities in ourselves. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>One of which is this idea of an ' outside world '. We generally have to work with what we have. Well, by ' external ' I was meaning apart from consciousness. The demon wouldn't necessarily exist physically. Another idea might be that we're one of many souls reaching closer to the truth of God or somesuch. The fact we have to think of these things in terms of an external world only shows how powerful a preconception it is, not that it's true.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>What we have is the experiences of all humans where our senses tell of of an outside world. Our eyes tell us that there is a section of floor in front of us and, if we step on it, we will not fall to oblivion. Our senses tell us that the object we see in front of us will respond as if its real - we can touch it, etc. All of our senses are telling us that the things we see are real. Yes, our senses can deceive us, as in optical illusions or false images that people might see when mentally damaged. That's where the trust of mutual experience and investigation comes in. One person may have the mirage, but ten others will not, so one can recognize which one is imagining things. I haven't heard of any mutual experience that people have had that suggests that the outside world we believe exists indeed does not exist. Yes, one scenario is a non-physical existence. However, once again, none of our mutual experiences have suggested that that is the case. That doesn't mean that it isn't, just that it has no support in human experience ( which is the only means we as humans have of finding out about our world, besides the unreliable means of imagination ). <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Our experience doesn't tell us that there is a physical object. We seem to instinctively reach that conclusion, but no sense data can tell you what caused that sense data.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Our sense data cannot tell us in an absolute sense that there is a real object, just that there appears to be a real object. All of the experiences of all humanity make it appear as if what we experience is real. Does that mean that it is absolutely real? Possibly not, but I would think that that possibility is small since NONE of our mutual experiences hint at those sensory inputs not being real.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3002_67_66__68_70_75_76_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>And you lost it again. That's OK - we'll get there. ;) But the point is you can't take the livlihood from the mother and expect her to have the resources for a successful pregnancy. True enough. It's an excuse - but then the illness or disorder has to be treated. Not until you tell me what the acronym stands for.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why not? because she doesn't want to? No one leaves the mental hospital after killing :p BPD = Borderline Personality Disorder ( see the movie : Fatal Attraction for extreme example ) there is also APD = antisocial personality Disorder... kinda like Hannibal Lector in Silence of the Lambs.. But my work is BPD :) <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I can't wait until you have to pay the bills all by yourself. No - because no means of support leads to no money leads to no food, house or doctor for her - and any other already born dependents that she supports. Time to take a quiz college boy. Now if jeapordizing one's career or livlihood is a reason women abort - which is the best answer - - - a ) BAN ABORTION ( and potentially let her and her family feel the repurcussions of that loss of money - or let her get an abortion illegally and unsafely ) OR b ) Find ways to make sure that pregnant women can continue to be supported if they have to stop working, and ensure that their job will be there when able to work again ( much of this is in place for higher paying jobs already - but there are severe gaps for the working class ) aaaah I actually am curious to know more about that, too. However I primarily work with pschyzophrenics, so I have been reading up on that more.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Yeah BPD is neat stuff. In taking the quiz. I would go with none of the above. If a women is in need of medical help and lets say she is homeless... I think people should help her out by providing home and food and medical help... whether she is pregnant or not does not matter here... we should address the problems that she faces. Now if she got into a situation that she lost a job and thus became homeless due to getting pregnant then we have a violation of the law and the company gets into some trouble. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Agreed. And if there were better things in place to address this and other needs - I think you would see abortion drop - not to mention both women and children would be happier and healthier. What beefs me about the pro-life side isn't that they want to reduce abortion ( I don't believe it's realistic to completely abolish ). I can totally get on board for that. But I can't get on board with how the pro-life movement. They put very little energy into actually helping these women, and a lot into demonizing them and trivializing everything they go through. You have done it countless times here. You have dismissed rape, mental health issues and even the need for a livlihood. I can't help you hurt women like that. Help me help them not need abortion and I will join your fight - until then, no. To a fire a woman for being pregnant - sure. But if she has to quit because she is pregnant? I was a waitress - had to quit at five months due to a major bleeding episode - I had to not be on my feet so much. Nobody fired me - but jobless I was.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Don't have a stroke anyone but I actually agree with Jitobear here. In fact, at the pro-life group on campus my roommate and I are trying to instill a new way to look at pro-life. We don't believe pro-life means anti-abortion... pro-life means help out life everywhere. And actually the group with " LIFE " across their mouths are like this... anyway, I think that all life should be charished and not just the unborns. If someone is hurt we should help them, if someone achieves something we should support them, I believe that if we try to help others become better then we will achieve more than trying to make yourself better. The idea may seem unrealistic but it has happened before. In WWII people set aside differences and worked together to achieve something. Look how awesome our country acted during that period. We can do better by working together and supporting life by helping each other rather than helping ourselves.

They are all so important, who did she think she was even daring to risk it? You're all under this idea that sex was created for pleasure, and it should be as available to everyone like Movies and Games. Well you are all badly mistaken. It's people like you that has treated sex as a thing for fun, and should be treated casually to the extent that young children are infected every hour daily by STD's and HIV. Ok, we've already blown off the resonsibility for sex all over the U.S. Look at how well that has done us.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Because sex is one of her needs. Check out Maslow's hierarchy of needs. This is just a theory, but it is very interesting. Many " needs " theories include the need for sexual intimacy. Along the same lines of reasoning, you are under the idea that sex is solely about procreation. Well, you are badly mistaken. That doesn't work so well. It would help your cause if you tried to understand that sex isn't just about making babies. It's easy to tell adult women who are in committed relationships that they shouldn't be having sex unless they want a kid, but in practice it's ridiculous. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>She won't die if she doesn't have her sex. But I'll be sure to check it out. I don't usually get this detailed on sex matters, but I will in this case. Sex is not strictly Vaginal Sex. Sex in general means a lot of things, and sexual satisfaction can be gained without Vaginal Intercourse. Vaginal intercourse, on the other hand, is the direct route to pregnancy. Then a couple steps back later in shock and says " Gee, she got pregnant! How did that happen? " Well guess what, they forgot a little reality of nature. What's ridiculous ( in this particular scenario ) is saying " I am in a sexually commited relationship with my boyfriend. Therefore, I am going to release my rights to my body and allow him to use me and risk my getting pregnant and all sorts of other things so he can get his sexual satisfaction.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You're right, but it is a NEED and to deny that fact is indeed a denial of the reality of what the human psyche needs. Thanks so much for the sex ed. I wasn't aware of other routes of sexual pleasure. So you are prescribing that people engage in other aspects of sex? Suddenly, you aren't so worried about STD's. Whoa! I don't " release " my rights to my body to my boyfriend / husband so he can get " his ". This assertion is ridiculous! You have a lot to learn about sex, young man. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Vaginal sex is not without its own risks, Bell. Then don't make statements about women in a sexually commited relationship as if they owed it to their boyfriend.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>* gasp* I did not say this, nor imply it in any fashion. I challenge you to support this statement. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Yes you did. I accept. ---- When you say this, you imply that it is ridiculous to tell women to abstain from sex since their partner may want some. I was showing off the dumb thinking a girl might have if she actually believed that.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>No, you implied it. I did not. I said, I said this in response to your concept that if women don't want kids, they shouldn't be having sex. I said naught about their partner " wanting some ". You have either misread my comment, or read what you wanted to into it. You really think I believe sex is for pleasure only? I've said many times that sex is NOT JUST for procreation. Either you are being dishonest or have not retained this information. I said, " You have alot to learn about sex, young man! " and this was in response to your comment that women " release " their bodies over to their boyfriends for their boyfriends sexual satisfaction. Indeed, if this is your sentiment, then you do have a lot to learn about sex. Wouldn't you agree? Again, I said it's ridiculous to tell women in committed relationships not to have sex unless they want kids, because it is. Telling married women that they shouldn't have sex with their spouses ( for whomever's pleasure ) is a ridiculous notion. I didn't say YOU are ridiculous, but that concept is. Do not misquote or misrepresent me again. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>No, I believe I received the correct message when I read your post. I've made reading mistakes before, but I don't think I did this time. You're doing it again. I am referring to YOUR PARTICULAR SCENARIO that you said I either misread or read it in a way I wanted. I know girls don't normally just hand themselves over to their boyfriends whenever. And now I'm signing off for the night.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>You're right, you didn't make a reading mistake - you just made up something and then went ahead and said that I implied it.

I have repeatedly stated the reasons why abortion is wrong. Not only from a moral standpoint, but a practical one as well. And on the subject of the practical, I'll give you this little tidbit of info. We are fast becoming an aging population. Now, do the math. When you've already had 40 million unborn children aborted on the altar of " choice. " What does that leave is with? It leaves us with fewer younger workers to support the retirees. Now, with all due respect to you and yours, I did not mean to come across as insulting. I'm simply pointing out the connection betwwen abortion, euthanasia and eugenics.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I am not arguing with your stance on abortion. I am pointing out that your snide little comment that these women must not be thinking clearly is insulting and misogynistic. And it is. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>My bad, I should have been more sensitive. What I should have stated is that, with any traumatic situation, people have enough on their minds without the added trauma of abortion ( I know where you might go with this, so I'll save you the wear on your keyboard ). The effects of abortion are a well documented fact!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You continue to insult! The implication still stands that you are better able to make choices for these women than they are for themselves. God help your daughter. Will she grow up believing she is capable of making a single decision on her own? Sure, you do - regardless of what the mother may think about the situation. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Now that's a pack of lies. The thing is, abortion should never be an option. It is flat out murder. Pure and simple.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>And men who wish to hold our bodies hostage as you do should not have the option to touch any of us. Murder is a legal term and abortion does not fall under it. Are you saying killing is never justified? Self-defense? How about monkey head's war in Iraq? Are you saying women should even lay down their lives for a pregnancy - and even if they were raped? You coward. It is so easy for you to say what we women ought and ought not to have as an option. Really really damned easy. Not like it will ever realistically affect you.

There is a difference between a living cell and life. None of those living cells in your body alone could be construed as a human being. The sperm and the egg do not equate to life until the moment of conception / fertilization, which is their sole purpose. You try again.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It's a fair response. What is human life is different than asking what makes a human being. We could probably keep a brainless body alive for some time, but it wouldn't be what people would generally think of as a human individual, a human being, a person. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Is it? Scientifically it's not. What you're talking about is a philosophical and religious debate. And although I won't discredit philosophy, it's not a science, nor can it be proven. I can give you proof that a fertilized egg is a human life by the standards of science ( we can argue semantics all day but you can't refute that it is by definition " life " ). But you can't provide a single shred of proof that a fetus, unborn child or whatever you prefer to call it, isn't a person, a human being or a human life... not from a philosophical standpoint or any other.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Then I can certainly prove that the fetus is not a person, since ' person ' is a legal construct ( not a biological one ) and I can point to the relevant legal precedents that outline the subject in question showing the boundaries of ' personhood ' begin at birth. Q.E. D Of course, that ignores the crux of the question : namely, is the fetus a person in the philosophical sense. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Like I said, whatever you prefer to call it... they are one and the same. Can you deny that a fetus is a human life? I suppose YOU could, but that would be disregarding science as it's already been shown conclusively that it is, in fact, a human life. Technically the crux of THIS question on this post was " When does life begin? " There was nothing about the philosophical discussion of person or personhood. So, can you prove that a fetus is NOT a " person " in the philosophical sense?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I assumed this had relevance to the abortion discussion. Yes, the fetus is alive. If we agree on some basic tenets, certainly. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>It does. I thought I'd define the beginning of human life. As you can see, many people are still confused about whether or not a fetus is a human life. Please, do go on...<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Since you've agreed it is as alive as an individual organ is alive ( human life at that ), I don't think you gained much. I start with a hypothetical. If we remove the brain of an adult and put it in a jar while keeping both the brain and body alive and separate, would you agree that it is rational to say the ' person ' is in the jar? Meaning that if you killed the brain it is rational to say the individual would die, while if you killed the body the individual would continue to live. This hypothetical is to determine, loosely, what the definition of a person would be. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Wow, you have completely missed that entire discussion that just took place, didn't you? I don't know how many times I can say the same thing a different way for you to understand. I tell you what, go enroll in a biology class at your local college. Ok, so let me get this straight... your argument to " prove " to me philosophically that a fetus is not a person hinges on a basis of a hypothetical? One that isn't even possible? Sorry but to PROVE to me that a fetus isn't a person, you should probably start with facts, evidence or at least a common shared belief ( not based off a hypothetical situation that can't actually happen ).<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I read and even understood the thread. Sinjin posted : So far we appear in agreement that a thing can be composed of living cells with human DNA and not be a " human being " aka " person ". You replied : Yes, we are in agreement at that. If you want to add additional qualifiers such as " separate " and " distinct " that's fine but not part of the original point. Actually I'm starting with a definition. As I stated, the first goal is to establish the " basic tenets " to see what we agree on. So I'm seeing if we agree on the seat of individuality. If there is no agreement on the basics, then there is no common ground to even have a discussion because we would be talking about different things. So I'll ask again : Would you consider it rational to say that the individual person is in the jar? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Go back and re-read my entire response to that. Yes, a thing can be a living cell with human DNA and still not be a human life ( a skin cell, a sperm cell, an egg cell, any cell within the human body is a living cell with Human DNA and is not a human life or human being. Actually, you started with a hypothetical question, not a definition. A hypothetical question that isn't even based in reality. Yes, we have to start with common ground, but I'd prefer any common ground to be rooted in reality, not fantasy and science fiction.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>lol, alright. It hasn't improved upon review. Rofl, sure, we can start on an even more basic level if you wish. It'll just take longer. Surely you won't argue that human organs, even removed from the rest of the body, are not alive. After all, transplants occur and the organs don't die between one body and the next. Would you agree it is rational to say that you are not any less of a human being when you lose a kidney, and that kidney should not gain recognition as a human being, despite being alive and containing human DNA?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-1117_88_78__95_102_110_145_152_153_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Just to add something that Parcum's said before : we are able to save babies who are more and more premature - so the woman can leave her baby, so to speak, earlier as medicine advances. We may even be able to raise babies purely in a test tube before too long. ( although I have reservations about how healthy the baby would be )<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Thankfully, some US states and other places have " safe haven " laws, so that people can avoid prosecution if they give their children to hospitals, etc. The difference is that you can just hand a baby to someone else, which you can't do with a fetus. It's not as simple as pre-birth vs post-birth. I don't know exactly what the laws are in all states, but it seems to me that people either have an abortion while the fetus is still in it's rudimentary developmental stages, or keep the pregnancy until birth, unless of course there are other complications. So you are comparing a fetus at mostly 8 - 12 weeks to a pre-born infant at almost ten months old - they are not the same. Again, a medical procedure is required. In other words, this doesn't mean that a woman can reach in and pull out her 4 month old fetus and walk into the emergency room with it. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That's true. I guess I would go back to my earlier question of whether the difference justifies the killing of the unborn human.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I think so. I generally follow the doctrine of harm reduction in terms of decisions usually considered in the category of " morality ". <br><b>S1:3-  </b>That seems to be a common beleif for someone who doesn't beleive in a Creator. What is your position on animal, and human testing? For instance, there's a rather infamous scandal where troubled children in an orphanage were used as test subjects for a Hepatitis immunization. Half of them were deliberately exposed to Hepatitis to test the drug. Do you think that these things are justified if they may save thousands, or millions of lives? Another question I have is about people who live painful lives. In my province, a man was jailed for killing his severly retarded girl - who went through a lot of pain and treatment. He continues to claim it was a merciful action. What do you think about such cases? Finally, back to abortion, what do you think of the arguement that abortion generally increases harm for women and society? I recently read an article that said things like child abuse - which it was beleived that abortion would decrease - have increased substantially since Roe vs. Wade. And there are the hundreds of women who have presented testimony to the Supreme Court on the harmful effect of abortion.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I think you're mixing up harm reduction with utilitarianism. Harm reduction originates in the field of health providers for drug users, but is now a broad philosophy of health care services in general. There's more info on-line, if you're interested. It has nothing to do with belief or disbelief in " a Creator ". That hasn't been my experience, I've known several people who had abortions of various kinds. That's anecdotal, but so is your claim. I wouldn't bother. The video is heavily doctored, it isn't a clinical analysis of the abortion process. Yet when it's done to an animal that is not human, it's okay? That makes no sense. Organisms that can feel pain we should avoid inflicting pain on. Human or not. We should avoid killing when we can. However, I'm not going to refuse to take antibiotics based on the bacteria's " right to life ". Obviously a human fetus is not bacteria, but it isn't a born human either. Life is full of hard choices. Whether or not to have an abortion is one of them. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I see... harms reduction means " they're going to do it anyways, so we might as well make it as safe as possible ". I assume you wouldn't follow harms reduction when another human being's right to life is involved. If so, our disagreement lies with wether or not the unborn human is as valuable as the newborn. I didn't know that. I think it would be interesting to see a real time video. I beleive that human beings are priceless. That stems from my beleif that God created us in his image. I completely beleive that animals should not be killed or damaged for no reason, I beleive they are amazing creations as well. One of God's directives to mankind in the Bible is to be a caretaker for earth. I can't say I've thought much about the morality of animal testing... but I think if such testing can save human life it is justified. I have to say once again that the disagreements here seem to boil down to whether we view the unborn human as different from the born one, with regards to rights and value.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>First, I don't believe in " rights ". I believe it's important to having a manageable human society that people aren't running around randomly killing each other. I believe it's bad to make a being endure unnecessary pain. Abortion is not applicable to the above. Second, as I said, we are not comparing an infant 24 hrs before it will be born from an infant the minute after it is born, we are comparing an 8 - 12 week old blastocyst / fetus to a newborn. For one, it's not a " real time video ". Its a piece of visual propaganda, heavily edited, with fake sound effects and slo-mo camera work. It's like how B movie directors make their monsters look scary when they're just a 4 inch high plastic doll. Camera tricks. I also don't see how an abortion could be interesting to watch. Seems a little wierd to me, unless you're an ob / gyn surgery resident. I get it. You believe in the church, I don't. That's the difference here. It has nothing to do with relative value, it has to do with your religious beliefs, that I don't share.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7792_15_12__18_25_28_37_40_4<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I agree with you, that's just plain silly.

So no, it doesn't gotta hurt at all, for me anyway. Duh... me so dumb. And evidently google is too because nothing came up in reference to the unborn or abortion when I googled it either.

Is that another secular humanist term that's intended to marginalize the unborn babies that pro-abortionists endorse killing to the tune of 1.4 million a year? Which explains why you edited everything after my question in order to attempt to ridicule me with just the question. Kind of lame and a very weak style of debating, not to mention dishonest.

It is common to refer to statements as claims regardless of their truth value. This is especially true in philosophical / logical arguments. I'm a new part of that education system, bub. The fact is that you said you didn't say what you actually did say, and now you're trying to cover that up by giving an alternate explanation that ignores the fact that this is a debate forum where " claims " are labeled for what they are : claims. It's a shame our education system has to compete with numbskulls who hold their misplaced opinions in higher regard than people trained in those areas. News flash, Holmes : I never said that souls existed. I never even implied such. I took a quick rip at Archie's pathetic arguments early in the thread and have since been arguing with you about why calling something a claim would mean that it isn't believed. If you want to argue that souls don't exist, or that nobody has shown that souls do exist, then your arguments had better be better than vacuous attempts to nail someone for faulty phraseology. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I know what I said and so does everyone else. It's a matter of public record Quit trying to manipulate the facts. It just wastes everyones time and leads the topic even more off course than it already is Sorry electrolyte, that one was my fault :( I wasn't trying to suggest that you made that comment, just that I was still waiting for said proof. My appologies. I should have re-quoted the person that did say it but now I think they ran away. Oh well... guess they can't prove it :)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>But I'm not manipulating the facts. Any reader with the inability to read your mind ( which is everybody on the planet besides you ) can read your words but apparently not know what you mean, since you say what you don't mean. I posted our statements right next to each other for everybody to read. This is the point. They can't prove it. They can't even present halfway decent arguments. So let's make that the issue instead of pulling claims of psychology-induced Freudian slips. And no, he's still here. He just loves " allowing " the thread to be derailed. Trust me, he does it himself, especially when he's getting his XXX kicked. Keep pointing out that he hasn't shown ( and can't show ) that souls exist, and he'll stop posting in the thread. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yes you did. Funny how your interpretation was different To be honest I'm not even sure what this thread is about anymore, this is the abortion section isn't it? :p My oh my how on Earth do you ever debate someone like that? Seems it would just waste a lot of precious time. In any event THANK YOU for the heads up. Looking forward to a great debate<br><b> S2:3-  </b>This is what happens on internet debate forums when you aren't very clear. Sadly enough, some people here can take a statement that is only the tiniest bit unclear, spin it, and then continue to misrepresent it even after explicit clarification. ( Free preemptive tip : don't try to be sarcastic online unless you somehow make it incredibly obvious that it's sarcasm. ) With Archie, it's not " debate " at all. I beat him over the head with the Truth Stick of No Mercy    and expect no rational response. Another free tip : don't look forward to many of those with Archie. Other people here do show promise, though. He's not ; he's just purely irrational. His irrationality stems from the fundy mindset he's locked himself into.

It will not fix rape, incest or other causes. But when women start realizing they can't jump out of being responsible for their sex life, they will start having sex less. Even if it doesn't work completely, it will decrease the amount of abortions some. Oh, and killing a baby so you can enjoy sex is purely selfish. It is nothing less than murder. It shows off inhumane people will go because they are so desperate for sex. Sex is pleasurable, but it was created first and foremost for sustaining human life. You can't ( unless tubes are tied ) just have sex and kill willy-nilly.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>This has no basis in fact. I don't know what forced pregnancy means. If you mean making abortions illegal, it will reduce the number of abortions somewhat, I predict. But, like most prohibition, it will not have much effect and illegal abortions and their consequences will proliferate. Abortion is not baby killing. Stop saying that. Using silly sensational language indicates a lack of a thoughtful argument. This paragraph demonstrates little understanding of sexual drive and sexual behavior. Also, no one is having abortions " willy-nilly. " <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It would help though. Murder and rape are illegal, and people still commit those crimes. It obviously helps to keep those crimes illegal, it would lower the numbers, Abortion is baby killing to me, and I'll use the wording I prefer. I'm to look at a person willing to kill a baby just to have sex and try to be understanding?!? And I did not say people have abortions willy-nilly. People want to have sex willy-nilly, so they'll go to extents like abortion to get it without extra burdens. There are people like that, a lot of people in fact.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Please let us know how you know that. What do you think about prohibition and how that affected alcohol consumption? As well as the other crimes that were associated with it? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You don't know, thelmoose? I guess not. Well I'm not here to educate you as if you suddenly had no idea of the effect prohibition can do. I don't know what you're talking about when you say alcohol consumption. You got a specific issue?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>1. Nice dodge. I repeat : How do you know what effect making abortion illegal will have on the frequency of abortions and the amount of sex that occurs, both of which you asserted. 2. If you don't know what my reference to alcohol means, you may not know what Prohibition was ( capital P ), which is directly relevant to #1. Look it up and then you might be able to respond. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Because laws have stifled things like this before. Even if it hadn't completely stamped it out. Slaves were considered a legal right before Abraham Lincoln came along. It was abolished and made illegal, and now there are very few if any people who have slaves in their homes. Now do you understand?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Huh? That's pretty whacked. You said that if abortion was illegal, " they will start having sex less ". Please tell me what evidence you have that this would take place. You have yet to anwer that. It is clear the Prohibition reference is still sailing over your head. When Prohibition went into effect, alcohol consumption did not cease, and there was a great deal of illegal activity generated. Now, the comparison between the behavior of alcohol consumption and abortion is not perfect, I'll admit, but I wanted to discuss you assertion that making abortion illegal will reduce abortions by comparing it to an historical precedent. I think it is a fair comparison if you are talking about sexual behavior. This kind of thing is what you do in arguments, rather than making claims and not backing them up. Making abortions illegal will create unsafe abortions to occur and many unwanted children to be born. If my Prohibition comparison was off the mark, your slavery comparison is positively looney. It's a little difficult to have slaves on your plantation and not have anyone notice. One statement you made is a safe bet, but I hope you were trying to be humorous : " now there are very few if any people who have slaves in their homes. " <br><b>S1:5-  </b>I can understand where you wouldn't believe laws stop things altogether. I find myself agreeing that making abortion illegal may not make it completely nationwide itself. But making abortions illegal will reduce sex a little if not a lot. I believe that if pregnancy was an issue you once again were made to live with, men and women would not be so casual about it. There are two points where you're predicting results are faulty. 1. Children unwanted is nonsense. There are couples out there who can't wait to adopt a child or children. 2. And making it harder to commit a crime is not wrong. If abortion were declared a crime, then illegal abortions being made would make no difference. Men get injured and killed during robberies all the time, maybe we should make that legal.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-6138_87_84__91_94_97_102_107_114_132_137_4<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Let me turn this around on the pro-choice side since it is a common objection but an unfounded one. Why do you advocate a means of violence to solve a woman's problems ( abortion ) when you object to a means of violence in solving society's problems ( capital punishment )?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Capital punishment : A major act of violence killing a human being, and you are in no imminent danger of being attacked. Abortion : Sometimes a necessary measure to make sure that Women's needs are met, and that they may pursue happyness. Yes, its a horrible thing, but some pacifists would argue killing something in self defense is wrong too. Such as if a criminal or rapist attacks you on the street, and you were carrying a firearm and shoot and kill the offender. It is legal to do this, and it would be justified. Same with abortion, the law says its justified, and for now, we should follow the law. Trying to change the law is ridiculous, and in my opinion horribly immoral. Again, opinions. You have the opinion that a fetus or embryo has the power to override a womens right to her own body, and we think that a woman has an inenfringable right to her own body. Don't get me wrong, i think abortion is horrible. But denying a woman the right to her own body is even worse. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I'm puzzled as to why you think abortion is horrible yet you don't even think the thing being aborted is human or worthy of protection. As for changing the law being immoral... changing an immoral law is not immoral but moral. Is pursuit of happiness a legitimate reason to abort?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I think the REAL human is worthy of protection from people like you. The law is not immoral now. It is the woman's choice if she wants to abort or not, NOT YOURS. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Perhaps you can explain then why you think abortion is horrible yet the thing being aborted is not a human. Perhaps you can tell us as I have requested many times, when your arbitrary point of humanhood occurs. Elementary science tells us that a new, distinct, living, human being is present at conception.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I think squishing bugs is horrible too, but i dont think bugs are human. I do have sympathy for non-human organisms too, just not as much as i do real humans. Humanhood occurs when the baby starts to take form, its brain starts to grow, its heart starts to beat. I think its a human when it starts to develop some human characteristics. I don't like abortion, but who am i, and who are you to tell the woman what to do with her own body? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The REAL human : human life begins at conception 18 days after conception the heart is forming and the eyes start to develop 21 days the heart is beating and pumping blood throughout the body 40 days brain waves can be recorded After the 1st trimester almost nothing new develops or begins functioning. There is mostly growth and maturity of what is already there. It is a human when " it starts to develop some human characteristics? " Then it is human all along. The trick is to get the woman to begin thinking of this other thing in her body also... to get her to begin thinking that there is more present than just her body.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Human life begins at conception, however a human being or " person " begins at first sign of intelligent. See above. I'm not for late term abortions, but I don't really worry. 95% of abortions are in the embryo stage, so we should be really referring to whatever it is as an embryo. I meant its a human being or " person ". My hair is human, my nails are human, my kidneys are human. An embryo is just another organ in the womans body. Its completely dependant on the woman, but I don't see you rallying against kidney donations. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>How is it " human " life if it is not a human being? You do acknowledge above that " human life begins at conception. " How have you come to know that the " person " is present at first sign of intellect? Again, you need to study elementary science if you would classify an embryo as " just another organ. " It is quite different than that.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>My hair is a human life [ form ]. I am a human being. Because how we think of a person. People are not people if they arent even aware of their own existance. How come it is not? It is completely dependant on the woman, and resides inside of a woman's body. I believe that is the defonition of an organ, however my internet is acting up. I'll get the def. shortly. Stand by... Ah! Here it is : Biology A differentiated part of an organism, such as an eye, wing, or leaf, that performs a specific function. Well, a fetus is part of an oraganism, and performs a specific function. Therefore it is an organ.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-754_39_38__40_42_43_55_61_62_64_66_70_80_81_82_83_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>[ QUOTE = Crim ] It's legal killing, not legal murder. [ q / uote ] I know that, but I'm using his definition against him. Is in if he thinks that abortion is murder than so is this. His point is that a life is a life and no one has a right to take it. I'm using his logic against him.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Let me clarify my postition, murder is the killing of an innocent human being. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Wrong. Murder : 1. Unlawful premeditated killing of a human being Whether it is innocent or not is irrelevant. Besides, to you Christians none of us are innocent. We're all sinners. The Original Sin nonsense. :)<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Ooops, what I meant was that's the moral definition of murder. My position is, if it's wrong to kill human beings, its wrong to kill the unborn because they are human beings. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Wrong yet again. The moral definition is the same as the legal definition. Still wrong, a fetus is not a human being even if it does have human DNA. It is only a potential human being. A being is a person. A fetus is not a person under the law, or in the biological sense either since it doesn't have a higher brain to form a mind.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I see. Sorry to bring up slavery, but obviously it was morally right while it was legally sanctioned. Thanks for arguing the main point! :) So, your position is that personhood is defined by having a higher brain. When does this develop? Does a newborn have it? My position is that human personhood is defined by three things : a body, a soul, and a mind. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>It was never morally right. The higher brain developes after the period when most abortions are performed. A fetus only has one of these things. BTW, what is a soul? Can you prove that you have one, that I have one? It is more than easy enough to prove the existence of a mind.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Yet it was legal. Therefore there are things that are morally right regardless of what is lawful. And what do you mean morally right? I was under the impression you didn't beleive in moral right and wrong. That is a bit ambiguous. Would you say abortion is wrong after that time? I don't think you can prove the existence of a soul. As for the mind, its not that easy... does it involve any amount of higher brain, a certain amount, etc? Do you think that different levels of mind means different levels of human value - ie, retarded = less human? Or do you think that any level of ' mind ' equals a human being? My position is if you would not kill a severly retarded born human, then you should not kill a severly retarded unborn human. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Wrong. I don't believe in morality based on religion inspired fear. There is a difference. I had even stated that Atheists and Agnostics based their morality on reason and not fear as theists do. That depends on the type of brainwaves it has. there are more than one type. A mind produces differen brainwaves than a blank brain. It is sort of like on a phone. When there is no connection all you get is a carrier wave. No contain. BTW, I'm not the one who brought up brainwaves. Just use a MRI. It clearly shows brain activity in reaction to the thought process. Even a simple mind is still a mind, and I have said this before as well. A mind is a mind.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I mean, do you believe there is such a thing as right and wrong? After all, if we're just chemicals, who really cares what we do? Once again you accuse religion of being fear-based and non-religion reason-based. Sigh. I'm glad we agree on something. The brainwaves usually start at around 6 weeks don't they? <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Of course I believe in the concepts, but they are still only man-made concepts. The same as good and evil. You base your morality on the fear of being punished forever if you don't behave. I base mine on survival benefit. The only differences is that I'm honest enough to admit where I get mine from. :) And the actually mind forms much later.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>You don't beleive in a real, actual right and wrong then. That's good, since you don't beleive in God - it's honest and logical. I can't imagine what it would be like, though. Do you really think, for instance, the Nazi's weren't evil or bad? Considering survival benifit, the really ' bad ' moral thing they did was attack Russia, since that was the beginning of the end of their conquests. Christianity doesn't say you'll be punished if you're bad, and rewarded if you're good - as if you were taking a test. Christianity says that there's something gone wrong with us, which can only begin to be fixed if we will let God help us. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>And neither can you since the concepts have always been for the most part subjective to each culture. By our standards they were evil. Not by their own. What truly defeated them there wasn't the Russians themselves, but what had also defeated Napoleon as well, the Russian winter. :) Yes, it does. And thus we are rewarded if we " behave ", are good, or punished if we " misbehave ", are bad. There is nothing " wrong " with us. That is only a means of the Church to keep us beatened down and thus easier to control as well. It is a classic tactic of anyone who wants to dominate another. Just ask any slave, or battered woman.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>But I do. I beleive that the real right and wrong is what God wants. Different cultures have some different ideas, but some are more right and more wrong compared to the real right and wrong is. That's why I believe that the Nazi's were wrong and our culture comparativley right. If you're interested, C.S. Lewis has argued that different cultures in fact have quite similar moralities. And the question is are our standards any more right than theirs? That's the thought that I would have trouble accepting - that the Nazi's were no more ' evil ' than anyone else. I obviously don't beleive in Christianity, then. I don't seem to follow you. Did people tell slaves that they were more sinful than their masters, and therefore had no right to freedom? <br><b>S1:8-  </b>Of course you do, but it really isn't no different than what I believe in this regard. It is just that I don't need the threat of some invisible sky father to enforce them. :) I've seen much of what he has to say on many of these topics, but than again he is a product of his own culture. :) Evil is in the eye of the beholder. The Inquisition and what had happened during the Buring Times was not thought of as evil by the Church of the time either. They actually believed, for the most part, that they were doing good. That it was god's will to cleanse the world of evil. Not the Christianity of the majority. Afterall, people will create god in their own image. You're no different. No, they told them that they were inferior, that they were less than human beings. That they were no differnt than the other livestock. Though, I guess the female slaves were human enough for sex. Or would that be count as bestiality? With Christian calling them no good and sinners does basicially the same thing as telling slaves that they were inferior.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3187_6_5__10_12_17_33_52_59_82_83_177_4<br><b>S1:1-  </b>So, how many unborn babies did your God drown in Genesis? Talk about hypocrisy.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>What if the answer to that was 0? You have begged the question. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Then you would have to be believe that out of the supposed millions upon millions of people who walked the Earth none of them were pregnant and there were no newborns either. Then again, to be Christian, you also have to believe the world was created in 7 days and their was a Biblical great flood too. The best part about writing a fairytale is that the author gets to make up everything as they go along.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Or could it be possible that God, as the sovereign and just Creator of the universe, through his divine will, could have orchestrated the world in such a way, that there was not one pregnant person on the earth during this time period? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yep, the same    sovereign    creator who gave parents the right to slaughter their unruly children just POOF made everyone magically become unpregnant so it could ease the conscious of those who oppose abortion hundreds of years later and not find themselves feel conflicted over worshipping a supernatural abortionist. Or did god just kill millions of    unborn babies    because he knew hundreds of years later their would be Christian apologists who find ways to sugarcoat his brutalities? I suppose the later would take less effort in the end. But God never said he stopped people from giving birth or having babies so I assume he just went ahead and slaughtered them none the less. Wow, some divine being you worship. Killing tiny little unborn babies. What a tough guy! Sure showed them something about morality!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Oh I don't sugar coat what he did.

Apparently you just did.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Wow, apparently you can't deduce one logical thing from any statement I make. I said : If God is just in everything He does, as the Bible obviously states He is, then it directly follows that he cannot be impugned by anybody for what He does. He especially can't be impugned by any human being, who we can safely assume is not omniscient, and therefore cannot know the situation fully. For you to imply that you are more just than God, is to imply that you know more than God does, which by reading your posts on these forums, we can safely say is flat out wrong. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Thank you.

If Position A says you must respect Authority X and if Position B makes you worship something that doesn    t respect Authority X then you provide a double standard. A person can only serve one ideology in matters like these. You may feel god is against abortion but it isn    t. Apologist logic    people commonly use to this defense to excuse psychopaths from their crimes. Because we can    t understand we cannot judge. And pro-choicers use it to when they believe men    s opinions are irrelevant on the issue because they    ll never be pregnant. No human being can judge the complete motives of another and by your logic we should let all criminals free. Your comment is weak of morality. More me to judge your god is to imply just that    I can judge. If you want to search for hidden meanings then be my guest but you are just utilizing the fallacy of attacking the messenger instead of the message.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>No it isn't. I clearly said God is just in everything He does, not that men are just in everything they do. When we are talking about what the Bible says about something, we assume the entire Bible. Thus it is impossible to refute my claim, on Biblical grounds, that God is just in everything He does. I have shown that for you to judge God is to in fact claim that you know more than God. The only way you could be right in saying this is if you know more than He does. This thread is arguing on Biblical grounds, that is, what the Bible says ; and as such, it is again impossible to refute my claim. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>God is just in everything he does because it judges it    s actions as such. It has nothing to do with reason. Since when was knowing more then the other guy a prerequisite to judgment? God commits murder, therefore I condemn the murderer. Understood? I am not interested in the excuses of a murderer. Murder is murder. I am not arguing on    Biblical grounds   , I am arguing on moral grounds. This forum has left talking on just Biblical grounds a long time ago. Another logic fallacy. Are we catching red herrings in order to compensate for a lack of substance to the topic? Do you have an axe to grind with me? I must warn you that people who hold grudges discard logic and dignity to fulfill their emotionally charged impulses. Having an axe grinding and army of logic fallacies will serve you no good against me.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3187_28_27__29_48_55_58_63_66_69_74_6<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Luke 1:15 "... he ( John ) will be filled with the Holy Spirit while yet in his mother's womb. " Here John is deemed a person while in the womb.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I didn't see the word abortion in Luke. Maybe if you wouldn't mind so much could you please show me where God mentions something about it? Because I asked for a direct passage on abortion. Not one that you think / feel / believe that COULD be. I am looking for the concrete. Not the subjective. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Luke 1:15 "... he ( John ) will be filled with the Holy Spirit while yet in his mother's womb. " Take this along with the passages denouncing murder. Along with the passages Cone and Steeeeve have mentioned.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That is nice but that still doesn't condemn abortion. Abortion is legal. The Hebrew word for murder exclusively means illict killing. Abortion isn't illict. You failed again. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Yes it does How not so? Prove it Biblically. Its been proven to the contrary.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No. It doesn't. You are just forging links and it is starting to look depserate and sloppy. I am not here to prove your points. That is your job. There has never been a Hebrew law against abortion that placed it as murder found. Never. However if we had to guess I would think abortion was permitted in Hebrew society. Considering the Jews believed that life started at birth and burial rituals were only permitted to those who were above six months of age after birth. Apparently fetuses were not equal to born people in burial cermonies. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Sloppy Joe Sloppy, Sloppy Joe Sloppy Joe Sloppy Sloppy Joe. You are living in lunch lady land. Here is an obvious link. We have seen that in the Bible, people are viewed as persons while in the womb. We have also seen that murder is unlawful. Conlusion : Murder of those persons in the womb is unlawful. How hard is that? Points have been proven. Guess all day long if you want. You are waisting your time cause it is black and white.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>I see you are living in redundancy land    where apparently if you say the same time long enough it becomes a truth. All you did was re-write the same argument but vomited it out before but this time using different words. Abortion is not unlawful. You haven    t even proven it as such yet. Keep trying    I see you are at the end of the line here. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Well, truth is truth no matter how many times you say it. We are discussing what the Bible says about the issue of abortion not what you or I or augustine or the pope or anyone else says about it. We have proven that it is Biblical to say that abortion / murder of the person in the womb is unlawful. That means that the Biblical and true Christian stance on the issue of abortion is that it is unlawful. Linus, I dont understand. The actual words have been given to you. Yet you ignore them. If you have a point to prove then prove. Or if you already feel you have, show me where you have proven that it is not Biblical to say that abortion is wrong.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>I don't understand why you search for something that can't be found. Every theologian agrees that abortion is never mentioned in the Bible and this is very apparent because you haven't proven anything except your poor use of mixing and matching bible verses to support your political agenda. I have asked for biblical proof of how abortion is murder and none so far. However, it doesn't matter and I asked specifically for a verse directly on abortion. You can mix two, three, four or even hundreds so you can boil it down to a single message but it still comes down to the fact a direct verse would only involve one passage. This is all I asked for and having read the Bible myself I expect you'll never find something that doesn't exist. Nice try though.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3187_103_102__104_105_106_107_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I find it interesting how you are using the fraudlent argument of changing the subject to get around the fact that you are too lazy to actually find the link I posted 4 times that shows VOR's history. While you may not have been lazy there, you are clearly using the fallacy of argument via laziness here.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why? Because you say so? Hypocrite, flat out, hypocrite. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>call me names all you want. It's not my fault you are too inherently lazy to click on a link I provided many times. After all, I provided the means, I cannot force you to look. Is someone cranky that I called the fallacy before you could use it to gain a advantage? Don't worry, that happens alot. When a argument is primarily based upon a fraudulent means, the user often gets very irrated when the foundation is suddenly pulled out from them and the argument crumbles like a house of cards. Don't feel bad. Besides, keep defending VOR, it won't be my problem when you support someone who has no grasp of political ideologies, financial systems, or history in general. I must say though, it has been a while since I've seen a argument entirely based upon a single fallacy. But I suppose that is because of your lack of expierence with them. If one is going to base their argument on a fallacious method, they normally do so using a few, as to guard aganist what just occured to yours. One or two can be pulled out, but as a whole the argument is still alive.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>As such, your argument is still a " because I say so. " Because of this, I have clearly pointed out that you are a hypocrite. Not only that, but by your own words, you have called yourself one. Why should I listen to anything else that you say? I have not tried to defend anything, except possibly your reputation. I have asked you to provide evidence for your claim that VOR is a hypocrite so that you could avoid being called what you call him. But by your refusal to provide this " so-called evidence, " and that's all it is at this point, I have shown that you have effectively called yourself a hypocrite. This settles itslef if you just back your claim up. You cannot get around the fact that you, by your own words, have called yourself a hypocrite. How does that feel? Woops, I might have just committed the fallacy of telling the truth. Shame on me. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>On the contary, the posts are there for you to find. Merely because you are too lazy to find ( easily ) the many posts where I linked his past doesn't make my arguments " because I say so. " Your laziness doesn't make me wrong. Keep telling yourself that. You don't. You never had to in the first place. Still, you're laziness doesn't make me wrong. Why must I do what I have already done on 40 different threads? Very amusing. This is just my advice : learn what a fallacy is before contesting it. Still though, you have provided me with some amusement. Call me what you wish, it doesn't change the fact that your laziness doesn't make me wrong. Interesting. The plan actually worked. Thank you, I now know how to properly go about when someone who doesn't understand what a fallacy is but uses them reacts when the house comes crumbling down. Very interesting. I wonder if i should use another one on you and see how it works.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>My laziness doesn't make you wrong, but your laziness makes your right? Interesting. I don't need to. You do a fine job of telling me yourself. My laziness doesn't make you wrong, but your laziness makes you right? Interesting. Because someone has asked for it. Besides, if you've done it on 40 different threads, then it shouldn't be too hard to make it 41 threads. Fallacy schmallacy.

None of your inferiors have managed to put up even the slightest resistance to My Superior arguments. I win.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>" Abortion is not murder. Murder is illegal. Since Abortion is legal, it cannot be murder. " That's not a commonly used argument. You're just saying it is because it supports you. It's not the " formal structure. " I don't really have a firm opinion on abortion, but I don't like people with big egos and big attitudes. The " mother's rights " argument is used far more often. Also, by calling everyone inferiors you really seem like a snob. And I read your website. It's a sack of horse ****, and you had no evidence for any of it. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes it is. Pro-WTC murder supporters often claim that abortion cannot be murder because murder is illegal and abortion is legal. Incorrect. It is a formal Truth-based notation of their argument. My " attitude " is just what you see in anyone who has the correct and accurate information. The mothers rights argument is based on human rights. They say that the womb-trapped child is not human, therefore her right trumps the child's right not to be brutally and callously murdered. You are a supreme inferior.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>It's not because the Abortion discussion is wether or not abortion should be legal. There are tons of arguments used far more commonly, most often is the mother's right argument. No, you are incorrect. The whole discussion is over wether or not abortion should be legal, not wether or not it is. Big ego is not correct and accurate. You're just a loser who failed in life and now blames society because your frail ego is offended by the thought that you might not be better than everyone else. And it's used far more often the legality argument, which is the point I'm trying to make here. You are a supreme arrogant douchebag failure in life who believes in a bunch of mindless bull**** that you can't prove to make you feel superior to everyone else. Get a life. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Does not matter, you are 100% wrong. Whether or not abortion is being discussed as to whether or not it should be illegal ( only one tiny aspect ), does nothing to negate the Truth regarding the OP. You cannot say that because there are other arguments, that the argument in the OP is not True, it is. You are being illogical and irrational. That argument ( in the OP ) is commonly used. It is false. I know there are OTHER arguments, but that does not change the fact of the matter. You are clearly dumb. You do not meet My Superior quality control standards. Goodbye.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Well, I completely refuted you but somehow you're still right. I know that you're too arrogant to do this, but if you take the time to read posts on other threads made by pro-choicers, you will find that the mother's rights argument is used far more commonly. You're talking about something you don't even know what you're talking about. No, you are being illogical and irrational. If you read other people's posts on the issue, you'll find that you're wrong. It is not commonly used, read other people's posts on the issue and you'll find that I'm right. The fact of the matter is that the other arguments are used far more commonly, you're just taking one, less commonly used argument and falsely saying that it's the formal structure of people who have the audacity to disagree with your royal highness. If your head shrinks enough to pull it out of your rectum so you can read what other people say, you'll find that I'm right. I knew you'd dismiss me. Because it seems anyone who disagrees with you is inferior. Using your logic, you are inferior and stupid, and you can't read what I say. I know that no matter how bad I prove the stuff you vomit onto here to be the bull**** it is, you will always accuse me of being inferior.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-4609_30_29__31_34_35_37_38_43_44_46_48_49_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No, theo, it is not. As I asked Steeeeve, how would you render those passages from Exodus? Keep in mind that Biblical Hebrew is not as scientifically precise a language as English or even Latin.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I don't see how it matters how I render the passage. The only part that matters is that " yatsa " has never and never will mean miscarriage. so how I render the passage could be anything without " yatsa " meaning miscarriage. The most accurate translation I know of is on the website I posted earlier. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>You don't have give me your ideas as to how the passages are best rendered. I have already given you the number of meanings that    yatsa    has, chapter and verse on the number of translations from    begotten    to    carry    to    go       bring       forth   , etc, etc. You insist that you know exactly what the writer intended in those passages. I am saying most scholars agree that they are ambiguous. I agree with them. If you know exactly how it should be translated, I was just curious for you to present it. You are the one who is saying there is one meaning and only one meaning to those passages in Exodus. I am the one saying they are not clear. If you won    t present exactly what your version of the words is, there is no more for me to say.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>none of the things you said were miscarriage... so can it be safe to say that " yatsa " doesn't mean that. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I truly don't understand your point. When a pregnant woman falls down the stairs and looses the child, I consider that she miscarried. Do you?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>the point is, if " yatsa " doesn't mean miscarriage ( and there is no indication it could or does ) then you can't really use Exodus to support abortion. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I have been saying that all along Steeve. You can't use Exodus to support abortion and you can't use it to condemn abortion. That has been my point. It is too vague. I asked a question in good faith so that I can understand exactly what you mean. I asked : When a pregnant woman falls down the stairs and looses the child, I consider that she miscarried. Do you? It is not a trick question. I already gave you my answer, I consider that a miscarraige. I hope you will answser because I truly am at a loss in understanding some things.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Yeah but you haven't been saying that all along. But thats neither hear nor there. If a women falls down and looses the child ( I assume you did mean looses and not losses ) then I would say this is not a miscarriage as the baby did not die. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>If I had been unclear in saying that previously,, but I will review my posts to see where I was confusing. Also, I was unclear in the question. The question was acually taken from a discussion with minister. If I were to put put the question in my words I would ask, " If a pregnant woman falls down the stairs causing the death of the fetus, I consider that she miscarried. Do you? " Sorry for the lack of clarity.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Clearly changes the question because " looses " is actually a word and doesn't imply death at all. If the baby dies because of " spontanous " acts ( such as falling down the stairs or the baby just dieing naturally in the womb ) then I believe the qualifies under what a miscarriage is. I also am assuming she did it on accident. Even if it wasn't an accident I believe it is still called a " miscarriage " but I don't think it is a spontanous abortion but more like a planned abortion. Hopefully that makes sense. http://www.teenwire.com/infocus/2005...iscarriage.php <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Thanks, Steeeeve. You make perfect sense. Miscarraige and abortion have the same consequence : the pregnancy is over. There is the additional element of " intention " that changes the meanings. I had other thoughts about this, but maybe later.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>To me it is all about intention and consequences of the intentions ( in a general sense ). Some say the intention of abortion is not to kill the baby but to free up the womans life. Maybe that is her reasoning but her intentions are selfish ones. And selfishness at the expense of anothers life is not gonna fly with me.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-4529_43_42__45_47_48_51_52_54_56_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Well if you want the end result of pro-life to be " government imposing " then my end result for pro-chioce will be ranking humans like Hitler did. Your end result will always be ranking one human over another. But why do I have accept the consequences of my position but you don't have to accept yours? You want the government to support the killing of innocent humans and you want the government ( and others ) to rank peoples worth. I've accepted my strawman consequence.. will you do the same?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Steeeeve : Because that is what grownups do, Steeeeve, accept the consequences of our words and actions. We don    t avoid the hard questions, we face them and address them. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Look as you selectivly quoting again. I want everyone to how you mis-represent just about everything... Besides the disregard for forum rules, you are just flat out lying. And once again, you " avoid the question " I hope my fellow forum posters will read this and realize that mis-quoting is wrong and I hope they will condemn what you do.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Grownups take responsibility whether others do or not. That was the point of my quoting you and my response. I quoted the only relevant phrase,    But why do I have accept the consequences of my position    the    but    doesn    t matter. Grownups accept the consequences of their positions no ifs, ands, or buts. As far as calling me a liar on numerous occasions, I suggest you stop slandering me. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Well if the shoe fits.... You mis-quote me, say I didn't answer question, and misrepresent my position. That qualifies as a liar to me ( but I am not going to say you are one ). Not only this, but it looks hypocritical if you are not answering any of my questions. I will ask it again. Do you believe in ranking humans like Hitler?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I never said that so I never thought you were posing the question to me, Steeeeve. The answer is No. I repeat No. When I ask someone to repeat the question it is usually because I missed it in the postings or didn    t understand it. You    re use of the word liar is a personal attack and should stop. I quote what you said that I responded to. I clarified it in an additional post at your request. Your tactic of personal attack to distract from the weakness of some of your positions won    t work Steeeeve. It is very transparent. And before you start accusing me again, why not ask pertinent questions or make substantive statements and request replies? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>So you admit that when you said http://4forums.com/political/showpos...33&postcount=9 You really didn't know if I was avoiding the question or rather missed it / misunderstood it? If you admit that you did not intend to misrepresent my post then in my next post I will correct myself in saying you were mistaken and not lying. However, there is a difference when someone says " I don't believe I should have to accept the consequences of my position " and " why should I have accept the consequences of my position when you don't do the same yourself ". The second implies that the other person is making a double standard and does not imply ( or say ) that I don't believe I should accept the consequences of my position. You clearly made it seem like I don't believe in accepting the consequences of my position and thus it seemed to purposly mispresent my position..o r lie as it is commonly called. If you can't see how it is twisting the facts then maybe you shouldn't be posting on these forums.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>At your request I clarified my statement. At your request I will clarify further by stating I did not intend, nor did I try to misrepresent your post. Will you apologize for slandering me by calling me a liar? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>It would be nice for you to re-quote me in previous posts... but since you say you did not try to misrepresent me, I will take your word on this and apologize for assuming you were lying.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-4529_8_7__13_18_19_20_21_27_29_35_42_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I would say we see it a bit different... 1.

Also, you didn't answer how the gov't would do this : Wouldn't they have to by this? I don't understand how that's hypocritical, nor do I understand how I " misrepresented your position ". How do you disagree with the above quote by Howard Beale? Honestly, I don't get it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I just decided to make a strawman like you did. You lose? Grow up<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I didn't make a strawman, I stated facts. Please reread my previous post. And yes, under Godwin's law, you lose the argument. Why do you respond with emotionally charged comments instead of answering the questions? I'm actuallly on here to learn something, not to insult people that don't agree with me. You and I have had this happen before where you jump to defensiveness where it is not needed. Do you have a response for my last post? How was I hypocritical, and how did I misrepresent your position? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>If you didn't mean to misrepresent me then I am sorry. However, stating " You think the government has the right to impose mandantory gestation and forced childbirth " is emotionally charged and thus can become a strawman just like being comparing your view to Hitler. Your comment is not a fair representation of the pro-life message. Could you state it like you did? I suppose so, but then I can state your message as ranking humans like Hitler did. While accurate it doesn't really protray the actual view very well and it comes across is a wrong way.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>How is this statement : " You think the government has the right to impose mandantory gestation and forced childbirth " emotionally charged? Isn't that exactly what anti-choice people work for? Isn't that exactly what will happen if the anti-choice sentiments make it into law? On the other hand, I, as a pro-choice person, do not work for " ranking humans as Hitler did ". That is the emotional response. If you want to go head to head with facts, you'd be better off with a statement like " you ( I ) believe that women have the right to kill their offspring as they grow inside of them ". I would go along with this, as would ( I think ) almost every pro-choice person. I could give you an example of an emotionally charged statement that is anti-choice in nature, but they involve cattle and deities and all kinds of stuff we've heard before. :) I'm trying to avoid it. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>It is emotional to say " government forcing... " because you are trying to make pro-life something it is not. THe whole purpose of you stating it the way you did was to get an emotional response. The fact that you think it is just about having the government force things upon people shows that you don't get our position. I really mean this too. If anything, atleast understand our position as I try to understand yours. I realize your position is not all about " ranking people " but if I did then this would show how I don't understand your postition at all. Perhaps you would like me to PM you what pro-life is really about.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Isn't that the result of the pro-life movement ( " gov't imposing... " )? And no, the whole purpose of stating it that way was not to get an emotional response. It is factual and what will happen if anti-choice gets it's way. I understand that that is not what the anti-choice / pro-life movement is about, it's about preserving life, but that is the end result regardless. Just like the pro-choice view isn't about killing feti, it's about choice, but that is the end result regardless. No one ' wins '. You are more than welcome to PM, but I think others would benefit from hearing your points as well. Thanx! :) <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Well if you want the end result of pro-life to be " government imposing " then my end result for pro-chioce will be ranking humans like Hitler did. Your end result will always be ranking one human over another. But why do I have accept the consequences of my position but you don't have to accept yours?

Like the morals that leads children to sign abstinance pledges, yet have anal and oral sex because that is not " technically " sex. Why are we so afraid of sex education? We sit around telling our kids that sex is most fulfilling in a marriage without telling them of the strong primal attraction that we all have as humans, and that they should be prepared wth as much HONEST information as possible ( Yes, it does feel good. Yes you should wait. Yes, there are strong emotions involved. Be prepared. Be safe. Know your partner. Yes, there can be consequences, etc ). Of course! The liberals are the ones breeding like rabits. We are the ones that have anal sex with multiple anonymous partners, and at the same time, pushing condoms on our nations youth. Yeah! Have as much sex as possible, but don't use the condom we just handed you! And all you women! You wanton sluts! How dare you entice men by just walking down the street! Wearing pants no less! How dare you work! You should be at home cooking and cleaning and taking care of the kids you had with you domineering husband, ' cause that's the moral way to do it! [ end SNARK ]<br><b> S2:1-  </b>We're not. We're just afraid of education without the moral underpinnings. Wow, you do like the taste of red herring, don't you? The issue of sex and education isn't a feminist issue -- it effects women AND men. I agree with HUnter that it's not too much to hope that parents teach their daughters to dress and behave in a way that doesn't make them out to be a slut, or to teach sons to have respect for the women they meet and to not take advantage of them, even if you disagree. Has nothing to do with women's roles in the home OR job. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I am not the one who used the phrase. " decent white girl, " or, " decent moral female. " They may try to disguise it ( quite unconvincingly ), but everything these people ( I am talking specific individuals ) say tells us that they blame the women for getting pregnant. The use of the word " decent " more than implies that any woman who considers an abortion is some dirty, immoral tramp, who has abortions because she is having a, " bad hair day, " ( their words ) that doesn't want her life inconvenieced with a pregnancy. As if she is going out and having sex with anything with a penis and then scheduling appointments at Planned Parenthood every other week for a " touch up. " Feel free to defend such misogyinistc B.S., but many here would agree that my description of these individuals isn't far off the mark.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Unless it's a case of rape, who else's fault is it? ( It's really ALL our faults -- society's and the culture we've let occur. ) Ultimately, I don't see what the problem is with expecting culture in general and even women themselves to take getting pregnant more serious, as well as all the social and cultural things that contribute to it. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So she got pregnant all on her own? No man was at fault? What you fail to understand is that abortion is a symptom of a problem, not the problem itself. And instead of addressing the problem, you are constantly dealing with the symptom at the expense of trampling on women's rights over their own bodies. Why are we not honest about sex in this country? Just telling kids to wait until marriage does not work. Hormones are too strong. We should tell them the truth. Sex feels good. There are emotional bonds that come with having sex. You should know your partner. You should wait until you are in a relationship, but if not be safe. There are diseases out there, so be upfront with your partner. Those points just scratch the surface of what we need to be addressing. Equality of the sexes would be a HUGE first step.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>If it was consensual, and therefore not rape, then she could have a. ) either not had sex, or b. ) insisted protection be used. Either way, a woman is responsible for what she does -- there is no reason a woman has to get pregnant. No, it is both a symptom AND a problem. Even many liberals say abortion should be rare. I can tell you from experience that you are wrong -- it does work. I did it. Yep. I don't know of anyone who doesn't tell that. That's why its good to wait until marriage. SAme thing. Why not just recommend they do it when they get married? What's the difference? Yep. This is silly -- you are preaching to the choir in every way and setting up strawmen. People who teach waiting until marriage are much more concerned about this than you and therefore go farther -- yours is a more LAX position on sex, not a stronger one. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I can't believe this. A woman getting pregnant is all her fault? Is this what you truly believe? So a man can lose control but a woman has to take all the precautions? Um, no. The unwanted pregnancy is the problem. The abortion is an unfortunate result. But when you have institutions that aren't being honest about sex, added with the unfortunate way women are treated in this society, this is the result you will get. Milk and cookies for you then. It would be nice if everyone had your self control. But why stop there? you can state to people that there are safe ways to do it, that even though you may not wait fr marriage, at least know the person you are with, talk freely about your concerns and your likes and dislikes, wait if you are still uncomfortable, practice safe habits from this point on ( if you are active ), etc. Realistically, marriage isn't for everyone. That is another thing that we need to teach people ( and not just kids ). Why should people who never marry never have sex? Please enlighten me as to what " stawmen " I am setting up. My position on sex is one based on reality.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>If a man loses control when the woman doesn't want it, that's called rape. If she DOES want it, why shouldn't she insist he use protection if she doesn't want to get pregnant? It's not an issue of blame. A woman is in charge of her body -- it's odd to me that you all want women to have complete control and responsibilty for her body when it comes to the decision of an abortion, but in the actual act of getting pregnant suddenly she's no longer responsible for it. Think about it -- if a woman doesn't want to get pregnant, she doesn't have to. She can insist on the man using protection, and it's sure not hard for her to make sure he does with a simple visual check. Or she can use the protection. With that said, accidents do sometimes happen, but this isn't a discussion about the accidents. It must be odd for you to not be in step with most other Democrats out there, who acknowledge that abortion is a problem ( just not one that should be outlawed ). Both are problems. Oh of course not ; we mustn't dare actually suggest that sex go hand-in-hand with commitment, huh? Goodness gracious, that would be too much!</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-9653_35_34__36_37_38_39_40_41_43_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>But you're completely missing the point. Although spanking meets the definition of assault, calling it " assault " would be a gross exaggeration, don't you agree? The same way calling spanking " assault " is an exaggeration. Parasite : An organism that lives in or on and takes its nourishment from another organism. A parasite cannot live independently. Sounds pretty accurate to me. Plan B/ Morning after pill. Oh, but it did. We're obviously talking about abortion when we say " choice ". This is the abortion forum after all. " Pro-life " is just as vague. Why aren't you complaining about that?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yes, I agree. It just makes a lousy comparison to the topic. Calling levonorgestrel a contraceptive is incorrect, its not a less exagerated replacement for abortion. Your right, I stand corrected. It is a good example of an exaggeration. Unfortunatly, those terms don't tell you what levonorgestrel is, were back to vague again. For instance, Keflex can be rightfully called an antibiotic. Calling it an antibiotic tells you what Keflex is / does. Calling levonorgestrel " plan B " isn't very helpful. Look back a few posts, I already said I also think " pro-life " is too vague. " Anti-abortion " makes much more sense. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That was my mistake, I should've called it something like Plan B, which is a less exaggerated replacement for abortion. Calling orange juice " Sunny D " isn't very helpful either. It's just a name, not every product must be called by its scientific definition. Then I stand corrected.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Your helping my point here. " Sunny D " is the product name, but, calling it orange juice isn't an exageration because thats what it is ( taking your word, I've never had Sunny D ). Calling " Kleenex " facial tissue isn't an exaggeration because thats what it is. Calling " Levonorgestrel " an abortion pill isn't an exaggeration because thats what it is. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>But " Sunny D " is not exaggerating orange juice. " Sunny D " does not describe something else more accurately, as abortion describes the procedure performed by an abortion doctor, not a pill.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>" Sunny D " is a trade name, so is " Kleenex " and " Levonorgestrel ". Calling " Sunny D " orange juice is an accurate way to describe the product ie. " Sunny D is orange juice ". Calling " Kleenex " facial tissue is an accurate way to describe the product ie. " Kleenex is a facial tissue ". Calling " Levonorgestrel " an abortion pill is an accurate way to describe the product ie. " Levonorgestrel is an abortion pill ". The description is accurate, succinct, and precisely describes the product. It is not an exaggeration and any attempt to claim otherwise at this point is willful ignorance. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>When I say abortion, what do you think of? Do you think of taking a pill? When someone says " I had an abortion ", nearly everyone assumes you went to a doctor and got the fetus removed, not taking a pill. When someone says " I drank some some Sunny D " or " I used a Kleenex ", we know exactly what they are talking about, the words don't have any alternate connotation like " abortion " does. I'm not disputing that " abortion pill " is an accurate description, it is. It's just an exaggeration, and exaggerations are always accurate to some degree. When we start calling Levonorgestrel the " abortion pill ", it gives the anti-abortion crowd leverage to ban it, when in fact it prevents much nastier abortions from occuring and keeps women safe from back-alley abortions. So lets just call it what it is, Levonorgestrel, and forget about it. There are much more important things to debate than fussing over the name of a freakin pill.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Perhaps if the abortion supporters arguement is damaged by their opponent using the truth, its time to re-think their position. " Prevents much nastier abortions "?? If I was an abortion supporter I don't think I'd use this line of reasoning. The " lesser degree of wrong " argument seems flawed from the start. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>If by " using the truth " you mean " bending the truth without breaking it " to vindicate your position, then yes, that is what you do. Exaggerations like that distract us from argument, and are an attempt to sway the reader without making any valid points. Here is an example of more pro-life falsities. They think we love abortions, when in fact we don't. We hate them. We just have the sense to know that forcing women to carry an unwanted fetus inside of her body is far more disgusting than any abortion could be. Everyone choose to have unprotected sex. Your mothers did.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8533_16_13__26_28_29_30_31_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>A couple of points need to be made : 1 ) First, though I agree with you that people should act more responsibly where their sexuality is concerned, it should be pointed out that, as Simone implied, when you only criticize one partner, it does seem that you are presenting an illogical double standard of morality. Such a double standard would then make readers lose respect for your moral stance. 2 ) Even anticonceptive precautions fail ~ 1% of the time so responsible sexuality does not guarantee protection from an unwanted pregnancy. 3 ) If, either through irresponsible sexuality or bad luck of failed contraceptives, a woman gets an unwanted pregnancy, then the decision of whether or not she should be allowed to get an abortion should not depend on how she got pregnant but on general factors of rights of woman over her own body vs potential rights of the fetus. Indeed, if a woman did get pregnant through irresponsibility, then that would only ADD to the arguement of her getting an abortion since there would be a bigger risk of her being an irresponsible parent than if she simply got pregnant through bad luck of failed contraceptives.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>I read a study from Australia that said 70% of the women who got an abortion were using the birth control pill. I guess you could say these people are trying not to get pregnant but what I see is that people should know that you still can get pregnant and that you need to know that risk and accept it. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes, people are taking a risk in having sex where the risk is higher the fewer precautions are taken. For example, with no contraceptives, there is a high risk of pregnancy. Using one contraceptive treatment runs a low risk but still significant for frequent enough sex. Whereas, doubling up on contraceptives ( ex. condom plus the pill ) would probably run a very low risk - just judging by statistics alone. For those that think that one treatment is enough ( ex. condoms ), I suspect that they do not take the statistics into account or just assume that they will not be the unlucky 1% that have the condoms fail. Either way, people who engage in sex do need to understand that there is a risk of unwanted pregnancies and STDs. However, the ethical question of how to deal with the consequences of unsafe sex is different than the ethical question of human sexuality. Having an unwanted pregnancy certainly puts a woman in a very difficult position, but I would contest that keeping the child is the only responsible alternative as, I would guess, you would claim. Abortion is also a responsible alternative - depending on the situation.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I am saying that the measures a person takes to not get pregnant are irrelevant to the debate on abortion. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I did misunderstand your post, then. Yes, I would agree that the measures that a person takes to not get pregnant ( or indeed any aspect of their sexual lifestyle ) are largely irrelevant to the debate on abortion. Of course, I am sure that we continue to disagree as to what the viable responsible options are when it comes to handling an unwanted pregnancy but, as you would agree, that discussion is independent from the discussion about the responsibility people have to not get pregnant in the first place.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Actually I think we agree on the responsible options for handling an unwanted pregnancy. Basically we both feel that once a human is valued ( I use value to mean something like it has a right to live ) than the responsible thing to do is care for the baby until born. The difference seems to be what is valued ( again I use that term very broadly ). I think a human is always valued while you give value to some level of brain function. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Yes, I would agree that we both do set limits on abortion rights once the human is valued. However, I would state my view as only valuing human bodies once there is a " somebody " in them. Since I view the core of the existence of people as their mental existence then, yes, in our current understanding of the source of mentality, that involves sufficient brain function. However, if one could prove to me that a mental existence could exist without brain function ( ex. a soul ) then brain function would be irrelevant. It is the mental existence I value - the mental existence that determines the existence ( in my view ) of a person. Brain function is secondary and important only in the sense that it achieves that mental function. Unless I have misunderstood your view all along, you value human bodies whether or not they have " somebody home " - it is the human life itself that you value, not any existing mentality.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7580_59_55__62_76_78_83_86_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>That is a rather stretch of the word. You have to take a definition of atheist and then define a word in that definition to come up with that. I personally wouldn't find that to be an accurate definition but you can use it if you want. Semantics. It isn't an improper use of the word. What does it matter to you? That's fine but you still don't get to define the argument between me and another member of the forum. I could care less whether you wish to join in or not. Yes.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>As long as we clarify that the word " baby " in these cases refers to a fetus, then I don't care. But in this context, I think we should be as clear as necessary. If the discussion is about the difference or lack thereof between a fetus and a borne offspring, then don't use the same damn word for each. Even if I'm arguing that five is the same as schmive, calling them both " five " just makes it impossible to follow the discussion. Fine, then I'll hold you to reasonable standards in your discussion with me instead. How is this not a fallacious appeal to authority? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>It refers to what it refers to. I don't think you can easily take it out of context. I don't go around thinking you refer to a dog fetus when you say fetus. The context is known by simple reading comprehension. It is apparently clear everyone knows what I am talking about. No confusion was shown. born and unborn work just as well. There hasn't been a problem yet. Seems saying one or the other is more qualified would be an appeal to authority. Moral decisions are decided by a certain group of people unless you can establish an absolute moral right that only they know. I guess the better question is how IS that an appeal to authority.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Then let's use those. Comments like these are the ones that really make me wonder if you're as familiar with debate as you've claimed to be. A soybean farmer is not an authority on ethics. An ethicist is. Appealing to the soybean farmer on the topic of ethics is a fallacy ; appealing to an ethicist on the topic of ethics is not a fallacy. What group is that? Who makes that determination? Who decides what people get into the group? Are you arguing that such a beast exists? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>This isn't true unless there is a predetermined standard of ethics and morality out there by which only a few have studied. Since this is not the case ( to some extent ) and it is all based on belief then the soybean farmer is just as relevant in the discussion as the ethicist. An ethicist has no better judgment on abortion than the soybean farmer. An ethicist has no better judgment on right vs wrong than the soybean farmer. That should have said " are not ". So it should have read : " Moral decisions are NOT decided by a certain group of people unless you can establish an absolute moral right that only they know. " Without that " not " it really makes no sense. I do argue it exists but I also argue that there aren't certain people that can " know " it better. It is a belief structure. I would say an appeal to an ethicist is an incorrect appeal to authority because they have no authority to decide right vs wrong.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The three-fifths clause declared them " persons. " There we go again, we crazy liberals " rewriting " history by citing the Constitution. One could say the same about any science. We technically accept nothing as infallible, but that doesn't mean that we accept what Joe Schmo off the street says about quantum physics. I question the assertion that ethics is " all based on belief. " Let us suppose that this statement is true, but that no absolute morality has been established. Why, then, should Washington bigwigs have any moral authority regarding issues that don't affect them? Why shouldn't the decisions be made by those people the decisions actually effect? Which sounds to me like an argument that Mr. Washington Bigwig shouldn't force their moral decisions upon the populace ( e.g. stem cell research, abortion ). A scientist doesn't " decide " what is right or wrong, but a scientist has examined the evidence and comes to a reasoned decision based on more extensive knowledge than the soybean farmer. The same could be said for ethicists and ethics. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Are you trying to tell me the constitution treated blacks like persons? Are we really having this conversation? morality is not a science and science does have a standard by which to judge. It is impossible to prove something is good unless you have a standard by which to judge good and evil. This standard can be nothing more than belief. I think it would be hard to show otherwise. Why do you think morality falls under philosophy? Assuming no moral absolute? If you assume this then there is no reason why you should or shouldn't. Murder, stealing, animal cruelty. Those too. using phrasing like " Mr. Washington BigWig " is borderlining on a logical fallacy by tainting the water. A scientist has a standard by which to judge... the ethicist does not unless the ethicist has concluded a moral standard and if there is a moral standard then the soybean farmer would still have just as much room to talk on the matter. The reasons for this are vast but in short, morality is not an observation or investigation. Morality is the conduct of the people to right and wrong. I can take this one further as well and say my morality by definition would not be known ( or have the ability to be known ) more to an ethicist than to a soybean farmer.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7580_91_87__96_97_98_111_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Because you know the human embryo and fetus is a human being? Fallacy aside, that does not fit the definition so no. The unborn does fit the definition and is therefore a human being.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Really? But my definition of a human being includes the trait that it is an organism with a physically independent life. Since a foetus cannot survive outside its mother's womb, until fairly late in the pregnancy, and indeed from a biological perspective could be regarded as parasitic, I don't see how it is reasonable to regard every foetal stage as a human being the way you would regard a human infant as a human being after birth. Frankly, I think it's insane to think this way. There was no tradition, religious or otherwise, of making this absurd claim, till fundamentalist Christians got going on it and created it out of thin air. But then, that's fundamentalist Christians for you : human rights begin at conception and end at birth. After that, the kid and mother are on their own. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>A parasite has to be an entity of another species by definition. There is also nothing in the definition that requires one be self sustaining and if this were true a newborn wouldn't fit the definition.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, they don't. They aren't physically independent of their mother ; they aren't sentient and self-aware. Your liver cells meet your criteria. Oh? Really? Since when did you become such an expert on the biology of parasites? A parasite is an organism that derives its sustenance by exploiting another living organism during its life. It doesn't have to be a separate species, just a separate individual. Of course, the definition of a foetus as parasitical is a little tongue-in-cheek. It's just that the foetus is genetically distinct from its mother, and shares many of the same properties as the usual parasites, in that it's totally dependent on its living host. It's totally dependent on its mother, and therefore cannot be regarded as a separate organism with rights of its own that supersede the rights of its host. A foetus does have certain rights, but so does the mother. You lot refuse to recognise the mother has any. To you lot, every mother is no more than an incubator. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Physically independent of the mother, sentient, and self-aware are three things not required to be a human being. An entity with human dna is all that is required. Your liver is part of an entity and not an entity itself. Well using your definition ( which is wrong it does have to be a different species ) then you just admitted the fetus is a separate individual did you not? Dependency is not a criteria for obtaining rights. A new born is 100% dependent but they have rights. Of course you would just throw in random charges creating a fallacy and a poor argument.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>A liver can be transplanted, it can be kept alive outside the human body. So can human cell lines. A flask of human cells is packed with human DNA, but not even the pope would claim it's a human being. At least, I hope he wouldn't. So yes... physical independence and sentience are required for a definition of human being. It's an individual organism, though it's organically wholly dependent on its host. That doesn't make it a human being in any objective sense, using a definition based in part on sentience, which is in my correct view, essential. Of course they do. But a baby doesn't have a parasitical existence, it's a completely, physically separate organism. Anyone can look after it. Foetuses have fewer rights, however, in part because of their total, physical dependence on and umbilical attachment to their host, and in earlier embryos, because of their lack of sentience, or even a brain to be sentient with. A post-natal baby is not the equivalent of an attached foetus in the womb. Even a non-biologist should be able to tell the difference.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7580_161_142__165_167_169_181_184_186_187_204_207_210_211_5<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Instead of doing your normal insulting with no backup, why don't you actually provide some data for once?

You have to be member of the club, and you pay to get published. That is NOT a peer-reviewed science journal. So lets look closer at the organization itself. On the home page, it declares its presence at Samford University which bills itself as " For God, for learning, forever. " Not at all promising for an institution that claims its scientific credentials to ally itself with theological foundations tied in with science. Hmm..... Sorry, way to fishy. No go on its objectivity there. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>This is pathetic. The organization is having a meeting at Samford university and you freak out over it. I see a lot of complaining over my source because it disagrees with you but have yet to see anyone else come up with something. I realize you prefer to have a conclusion and work your evidence around it but it is getting ridiculous at this point.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>No, I am saying that they don't meet the definition of a scientific source. And as THAT was your source of the " confirmation " of your political misrepresentation of biology, it still is lame and invalid. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>They don't meet the definition of a scientific source because you disagree with one thing they said. If biology agrees with you then prove it. All you have done is ramble how wrong I am but you have yet to show you are right.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>An outright lie as I would have expected from a pathological liar fundie. The journal is NOT a peer-reviewed Scientific Journal. I documented this and thus DID show how I am right and your denial therefore is a lie... AGAIN!!!!!! <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Really? Is the AAAS a non-scientific organization too? Hope you don't read the journal Science because it isn't good enough for you. You just choose to attack the source because it disagrees with your viewpoint. Don't let science get in the way of your fanatic beliefs. If it isn't a peer-reviewed journal than why does it have to be reviewed by two experts in the field? Why is the journal associated with the AAAS? Why do you attack the source and not offer one that supports your view? Is it because you can't provide evidence for any claim you make or because you enjoy the taste of sand? Keep digging that hole Dane.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Hard to say, but their journal doesn't meet the criteria for a Scientific Journal. Sure it is. Are you saying that the Scientific Journal Science is using the same criteria for publishing and peer-review as your source uses? Or are you LYING again? Nope. I showed how it is not meeting the requirements for a Scientific Journal. That you ignored the evidence just further attests how truly corrupt and dishonest you are. My goodness, you are talking to the mirror again. There is NO evidence that these are the type of reviewers chosen. I documented how reviewers were chosen, so you now choose to LIE again. It is their journal. That's mentioned and documented on their website. Did you miss that? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>And you get to decide this because???? I'm guessing the only journals that you support are those written by NOW. I'm saying the AAAS publishes it. The requirements you arbitrarily made up? Really? I was thrown off by this : " Manuscripts will be reviewed by experts in the research area ". So other than them saying they do so, there is no evidence.... To add to your ever embarrassing failure here is a description of this journal provided by General OneFile : * About this Publication Title : Journal of the Alabama Academy of Science ISSN :0 002 - 4112 Format : Magazine / Journal Peer-Reviewed : Y Frequency : Quarterly Language : English Audience : Academic Gale Subject Headings : Science and technology Description : Science journal.

It also isn't their journal... the journal is an affiliate which I agree means you believe that journal represents your values. So if the AAAS, a respected organization, supports this journal why can't you? Why have you still failed to provide any proof that my definition is wrong?<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Nope, there are standards for a journal to be Scientific. I already pointed out where this journal doesn't fit these requirements. Who? I accept those journals as scientific that are following the requirements of the independent peer review and submission policies that makes them scientifically valid. This journal does not hold an independent and secret peer-review, nor does it select on content merit ; instead going for you paying for submissions. These points makes the journal not scientific. you were trying to claim that it was the equivalent of the journal Science. Nope, the requirements necessary for being a scientific journal. The submission requirements clearly stated that the authors had to submit a list of reviewers. That makes it NOT an independent evaluation. Because it is not a peer-reviewed, Scientific Journal. It doesn't meet the standards, it is what is called a vanity journal. I provided proof earlier. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>It seems to be a scientific journal based on the standards you wrote and based on reality. I already posted where it was a peer reviewed journal and now you just don't wish to admit you are wrong. Can you show these are actual requirements for a scientific journal or are you just making stuff up again? Furthermore, how is a " secret peer-review " independent? Seems like that lacks transparency. I'm claiming the people that operate the journal Science support this journal ( the AAAS that is ). Apparently it is because you keep addressing it. Yes it does. No you didn't<br><b> S2:6-  </b>You seem to repost that lie time after time. The journal requires one author to be member of their organization, it refuses independent editing and requires the authors to pay to be submitted. As I have pointed out, these requirements precludes it being a scientific journal. Your ongoing claims to the contrary, after you have been shown otherwise. Really? Where is it listed that the article is reviewed by experts in the field, and who do not know who the authors are? Oh, wait, you didn't provide that information anywhere. now you just don't wish to admit you are wrong. [ / quote ] I documented where you are lying. That does not make me wrong. Let me help you with some easy reviews : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review You got to be incredibly ignorant about this when you don't even know that the secrecy is about who the author is. We KNOW who the peer-reviewers are, but the peer-reviewers are not supposed to know who the authors are. Sheesh. Is there ANYTHING at all that you know about the Scientific Method? Or are you utterly and completely science-illiterate Are you? Where is your documentation? Sure I did. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>There is nothing that you have given that shows this journal to not be credible. The fact that they are associated with the AAAS ( the writers of the journal Science ) is proof enough. Furthermore, I showed where a company responsible for maintaining a database articles has declared this journal to be peer-reviewed and acceptable. You provided the information actually. See that Word document you posted at the bottom. It says : " Manuscripts will be reviewed by experts in the research area ". Furthermore, there is no criteria stating the author cannot know who is reviewing or that they have to know. You are grasping at straws here. I documented where you are lying. That does not make me wrong. So your claim is yet ANOTHER LIE. Are you at all able to post without lying? I find it a little ironic that you quote wikipedia to try and prove a scientific journal is not up to journal standards. Furthermore, nothing in that wikipedia article suggests this article isn't peer reviewed. In fact, we have already seen where people believe it to be peer reviewed. Seems your article suggests the peer-reviewers shouldn't be known by the public. Furthermore, are you claiming wikipedia is the standard? http://www.aaas.org/aboutaaas/affili...ies_of_science</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7748_523_520__524_528_530_537_3<br><b>S1:1-  </b>some of you are trying to push the fact that it is ok to abort babies, and I still disagree, it is murder and I can not bring myself to believe other wise.

I think some of you need to look at a bible and do some soul searching, I am not the hateful one here.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>It's OK to have opinions. Any opinion. However, the point of a debate forum is to make a logical argument upon which those opinions are based. Having an opinion " just because " or " because my pastor said so " or because " I believe in my heart " is open to criticism in a forum such as this, unless you also supply a reason behind those ideas. Also, I think that's a rather irresponsible way to go through life. If we don't think these things through, we have no basis upon which to make decisions when faced with novel information. Doing something solely based on another's urgings without examining the underlying reasoning is childish behavior.

In addition to merely spouting bible passages, you should express the ideas in your own words as much of the bible is inscrutable to me. Please tell me why you feel the way you do. You say the bible speaks of not harming the unborn child. Please show that specifically. I would indeed also like to see where the bible states specifically that idea that we need to protect the conceptus immediately after sperm meets egg. You say that is the case " if I perceive it correctly ". Maybe you don't. Please provide a logical argument. Thanks for finally losing the ALL CAPS. That was really irritating. Now work on spelling and grammar and it will be much easier to read and understand your posts. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>The bible states that your body belongs to God. 1st corinthians 6 - 19 states that your body is a temple of the holy spirit whom is on you, whom you have recieved from god, you are not your own, therfor honor god with your body. A women who is consenting to an abortion is not honoring her body, nor the life that she carries. You shall not commit murder is stated in the ten commandments, and murder can also translate into dash into pieces, which is a very accurate description of an abortion procedure. Exodus 23 7 states we should not put the innocent to death, well a fetus is an innocent. And off the subject sorry about my grammer I usually use a spell checker.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Looks like you failed to support your contention, and I asked you to supply passages / text with your interpretations, not merely citations. Your answer is that the body is a temple of the holy spirit who is " on me " ( whatever that means ), and is not mine, but god's. Fine. From that you extrapolate that abortion is not honoring one's body. There is no mention in that passage about a fetus. I could go on. I asked you a simple question. Twice. You have been unable to support your assertion that the bible states that we must protect the zygote immediately after conception. I thank you for your response, your avoidance of upper case, and your better attention to spelling. You needn't respond again.

And I dont stand in front of clinics and I am not mean to those who have abortions, but It should be illegal and I will support in making illegal. The bottom line is we all know, including these teenagers that having sex has many consequenses and if you cant take responsibilty then dont have sex. These women are ignorant cowards. You know if someone kills a women who is preagnant that person is charged with not only the murder of the mother but also the unborn child, and a women who has an abortion should be charged with murder and senenced to the max for the simple fact that abortions are a brutal act of violence against a child. And by the way the doctor should be charged to!<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Freedom of choice should be illegal? That is pretty warped and asinine. Should it also be illegal for a woman to take vitamins? According to you - yes - because a certain dosage of vitamin C will cause a miscarriage. You'll NEVER stop abortions as they have been happening since mankind has first walked this Earth. One way or another women will control their own bodies regardless of slavery nazis like yourself who try to control women, and only see women as being invisible. Wow, what in your head makes you think that's OK? First of all it isn't murder, so please learn the very basic definition of the words you ' try ' to use. Secondly, according to your so-called reasoning, if a woman dies while giving birth then the baby should also be sentenced to the max for committing her murder. Deal with it. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>OK, well freedom of choice is ####, We do not have freedom if we kill someone and I beg to differ but abortion is murder, and a very brutall murder at that. If a women does not want a child then she should close them legs and keep them that way. If her life is in danger then again keep those legs closed, adoption is a great choice.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I'm sure our founding fathers appreciate your ignorance. Maybe since you don't appreciate freedom of choice you should move to russia where you'll get a refresher course on its importance You can beg all you want but it does NOT meet ANY of the terms qualifications. Deal with it. In society you can't just make up your own definitions for words like you do. Do you know what they medically call someone that makes up their own definitions to words? Psychotic ;) Now you're just being ignorant Thank God for Karma and the fact that people who think like you usually end up having a bad life from all the bad energy generated around them. How poetic <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I am not the one having a bad life, I did not abort my children. As far as freedom goes you dont have the freedom to kill your neighbor, but the freedom to kill your child<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You can't say that as there is a lot that can happen between now and when it ends. One thing that I know is true, no one, not even you, can out maneuver Karma. All of that bitterness that runs through your veins, all of that hate for fellow adults, all of that justification for all of those lies that you try to convince yourself of, all of that poison in your head that makes you think that you can selfishly control another person... it all adds up in Karmas eyes, and as usual Karma will win. Looks like it sucks to be you, as God sees nothing wrong with abortion, as he causes them through miscarriages everyday of the week Earth to Christina, this is a forum about medical abortion. NO ONE is killing their " neighbors " <br><b>S1:4-  </b>you are correct this is about abortion, my point is we do not have the right or freedom to kill one another, so how can a mother havethe right to kill her child? And I am not a hateful person, I do not hate one who kills her child, I only wonder why she is so hateful and selfish. And God has the right to take these innocent lives, we do not.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7748_300_295__303_304_305_308_311_313_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>No there is a difference and trying to say that allowing abortion will lead to the ' right ' to terminate children after birth is just ridiculous. Once a woman CHOOSES have the baby she has assumed certain responsibilities. Once she takes those responsibilities she must legally and morally uphold her end. Of course, she could give the baby up for adoption or whatever. But this initial choice is the woman's. Once she does choose to have a child she MUST take care of it or face the consequences. But because of those consequences ( and the physical ones as well ) the woman must have the opportunity to make that choice of her own free will.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Why can't it be said that choice is made prior to having sex? What about if a woman had no choice for 9 months after birth? In other words, adoption wasn't available. Would this same rule apply? Seems given the first quote you would say no because all of a sudden an obligation is there. So what is the standard here? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>[ QUOTE ] Because women have every right to enjoy sex, just as men do. However, there is no 100% certain method to ensure that she doesn't get pregnant. To say that a woman MUST give up sex as the only way to 100% be sure that she won't get pregnant is unjust and creates a lower caste system for women. I'm not sure I understand your scenario. But at some point in the pregnancy the woman decides she's going to have her baby ( right now it is the limit at which to have an abortion ). After choosing to carry on past that time, she assumes responsibility for the baby.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Every standard you come up with is arbitrary with no logic. It seems like you have the solution and are creating a standard to get that answer. Why is " choice " not allowed after birth? What changed? If one does not to believe that all persons deserve equal rights then you open up the idea that any person can have rights removed for whatever reason. In this case I do argue a slippery slope because there is no instance in human history where declaring people unequal is justified ( and before we get the " what about criminals " argument let me say I believe they have equal rights because they were treated the same as anyone would have ). Why can't this be after birth? I disagree with the idea that this comes down to a woman's right to anything. I am of the idea that we all get equal rights and equal treatment. At no point would any " right to one's own body " outweigh a right to life when those two are at odds with each other. It can't because this doesn't apply across the board meaning another standard is used to degrade an unborn person. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>[ QUOTE ] What are you talking about? You said that simply having sex = the choice to be responsible to carry a baby for 9 months. I said that that's not correct. That women have the right to have intercourse without having to be afraid that they'd get stuck with a baby. No method of contraception is 100% except abstinence. Women should be able to enjoy sex as well as men or we're going to have one of those ' unequal ' situations you are worried about. That choice happens when a woman doesn't get an abortion. By CHOOSING to carry the baby to term, she's obligated herself to taking care of it ( or giving it to someone who will or whatever ) Because that's neglect. But it does. The fetus ( or unborn baby ) can't force a woman to carry it if she doesn't want. The woman must make that choice. Once she does, she's on the hook. Right now there is a time limit in which to get an abortion. A woman must make the choice by then, that is her responsibility. If she chooses to carry the baby past that time, she's made her decision.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>The point is that all of these are random inconsistent standards. You think equality is important but only sometimes. You think choice is important but only sometimes. You think a right to your own body is important but only sometimes. All of these " sometimes " just so happen to allow abortion. What is the logic behind these? Why the exceptions? This violates what I said : " At no point would any " right to one's own body " outweigh a right to life when those two are at odds with each other. It can't because this doesn't apply across the board meaning another standard is used to degrade an unborn person. " So what are you saying " but it does to ". You are creating a standard but have provided no logical explanation for it. Is there a reason for this belief or is this just what your belief is? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Wait, wait. You are the one that for twenty posts kept saying ' but pretend that IF unborn were considered people ' and now you are saying that I'm the one saying the ' it does to [ sic ] '. Nice try. The standard is that no person in a free society can have the control of their bodies taken from them to the extent that forcing a baby on someone does. Your saying ' what I said was at no point.... ' Which is your ' because I said so. An unborn baby ISN'T a person ( even if you assume it is ) and even if it were, the rights of the mother always would outweigh the rights of the embryo ( at least to a point after which she has ' chosen ' to keep it ).<br><b> S2:4-  </b>The unborn isn't controlling the woman in a pregnancy but merely is living in the only environment allowable to live. The woman can still do many things granted a restriction is now placed. So what is the standard for restriction? If the burden is caused from a born child and is equal to the burden of a unborn child then wouldn't think standard, if consistent, allow you to kill both? Are you going to say " the woman has accepted the responsibility to take care of the child "? If this is the case then why does it have to be before birth? Where did this come from? Finally, why would a woman be granted the power to bestow rights? Do you prefer unequal treatment? You standard is still seems nothing more than a conclusion followed by a means to get there. I still can't figure out if this is just pure belief or if you have some logic behind it. There is nothing wrong with pure belief but I'd like to ask where it was derived from.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7748_143_139__148_156_169_173_179_182_183_184_186_187_188_189_190_191_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The government can't even make us organ donors at death. The presumption is in favor of the individual's rights over their own body -- even after they're dead, and there is no disagreement as to whether or not a person is present.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Yet every claim of a " right to your own body " always ends up with exceptions when it violates a right of another person. For example you don't have the right to use your body to hit me. So now when someone claims the unborn is a person then needless to say the supposed " right to one's own body " is no longer an issue as it is as best trumped. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>That's a bottom line, isn't it. Though of course the person view is a religious or metaphysical position. Not what you can establish. Which we thus leave up to individual discretion. Then, there are rights and there are what people can do, regardless of the State. Is that not, at times, a right? Phyllis, Speed limits are left to the states and certainly are addressed by the Constitution in a broader sense. Suicide is a good example of what people can do, regardless of the State. If an individual wants to take their life, there's not much the government can do about it, to that person, that is, once they're gone. I would say that suicide is a right, though often not an advisable course of action, and open to argument as to whether or not it is the right / wrong thing to do.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Generally it is not let up to an individual's discretion because I can't go around claiming you are not a person and therefore claim it is ok to beat you up. The whole point is that a " right to your own body " is not a claim that can go anywhere in the abortion debate and I'd go further to say that the right is not even an absolute or true right. It has elements that may be true but I don't see a blanket absolute right being the case here. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>There is no dispute as to my personhood or your own. And even then, it is not about absolute rights, an absolute right not having been asserted. But there is dispute as to the personhood of a developing fetus -- and widespread agreement on a lack of pertinent evidence ; therefore, you are free to practice what amounts to your religious / spiritual / metaphysical beliefs about the nature of that being, and insofar as your own body is concerned ; but not mine, thank you.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>When I claim you are not a person there is a dispute about whether or not you are a person. So since a dispute exists does that mean I can now harm you? Since when does dispute mean we have to default to doing nothing? " I think slavery is ok but you don't so therefore you should just mind your own business ". That kind of logic is crazy. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Get real. It is not just about dispute, but widespread agreement on a lack of pertinent evidence. A 150 cell blastocyst is just that. No more, no less. Except as a matter of individuals ' beliefs. Btw, I can assure you that there is plenty of factual evidence as to my personhood, that I severely bite back when harmed, and that I possess full legal status to do so, too. Even if the other human being thinks I am but a lamppost. ;)<br><b> S2:4-  </b>And this speaks to nothing about the differences in a dispute. By your logic the idea that slavery was ok by 50 + % of people in the 1800 s should have led to everyone just leaving it alone and not trying to get their view passed as law. The notion just doesn't hold up. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Yes, I have more than once already, but you are ignoring it. You keep drawing these false comparisons. There is no evidence that a 150 cell zygote is a person. All we can agree on is that it is a 150 cell zygote. Nothing more, nothing less. Deal with it, Steeeeve.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Even though you are wrong, this wasn't your argument to begin with. Your basic argument was that when something is in dispute we should default to leaving up to an " individual's discretion ". I claim this is a poor position to take because it would make any dispute over a right subject to just being tossed aside. I gave the example of slavery because whether or not slavery was ok was a moral question dealing with rights. If we say " well, it's in dispute so just leave it up to ' individual discretion '' is a position I don't think many are willing to accept. Now if you argument is only that we should leave it up to " individual's discretion " when talking about persons then we really have two issues. Number 1, you already have to know what an individual is before you can tell them they should be able to decide this... thus being a circular statement. Number 2, on what basis is this a good idea? I simply disagree with it as it is arbitrary even for the abortion debate. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>No, and I already corrected you on this point. There was another factor I clearly stated from the outset regarding evidence. And what I basically provided was a description of how our reasoning as a society works, its justification. Which I support. One would have to oppose scientific thinking, not to. Be convinced that they were entitled to impose their religious / metaphysical views on others, and against their will.<br><b> S2:6-  </b>Evidence of what? Moral belief is often times outside of evidence. If you claim the unborn is not a person then I simply say why should we use your definition of person? Person as defined in the dictionary says an unborn can be called a person. Does that mean anything? Not really but neither does your view. The same could be said about slavery. If you are just of the belief that blacks should be slaves then there really isn't anywhere you can go with that. There is no evidence that any person that believes that really doesn't believe that. And thus we circle around back to my original point that disregarding in a dispute makes no sense. Science offers no answers on the morality of abortion. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>There is only evidence of a 150 cell zygote, with none of the characteristics which we do know give us our own personhood. Agreed. Sometimes it is based on faith or other aspects of human experience that are not rational. I am not claiming that a developing fetus is not a person. I am simply saying that it is a matter of opinion. That you or I are people, is a matter of fact. It means people can say a lot of things, even write them in dictionaries. Slavery is quite another thing. You have clearly evidenced equal human beings whose integrity and worth is discounted because of race, class, ethnicity, gender, etc. A 150 cell zygote is still, by all accounts, just that. The rest is a matter of belief. No. But neither does religion or ethics. The views vary tremendously. However, there is a clear paradigm upon which we can agree -- this is fact -- and this ( the rest ), is a view based on faith, metaphysics, religion, different values, etc. Not quite the stuff for a murder conviction.<br><b> S2:7-  </b>This, of course, is a matter of opinion. Perhaps to me you don't have the characteristics of what makes someone a person. What fact? If person is an established word then please tell me why your definition is the right one. Why should we use that definition as opposed to one that says personhood starts at 18 years old? It only is " quite another thing " when we use your definition of what a person is. I'm saying why should we use that? The definition of person is merely belief. Your's may be no better than mine. You have no evidence that yours is right and mine wrong in terms of science because there isn't a science answer for this moral question. No there isn't. And what you argue here is that only that which is clearly agreed upon is " fact " and true. So when blacks were slaves and this was not clear then how would your argument work? It just wouldn't.

The same question I asked Chloe : I asked a simple question which you did not answer. Do you believe that the fertilized ovum should be treated like a person, with all the rights that come with that? I'd appreciate a direct answer -- which you have been avoiding since I have asked it. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>you are kidding me right? You realize that " men " was a univerisal ( and still is ) term back then to mean ' mankind '. The founders ( many of them ) actually realized that slavery was wrong and hoped it would be phased out over time... sadly it took a war so they were a little off on that one. When did we not answer this? I believe the answer was yes to the rights question... life liberty and pursuit of happiness are the rights I'm thinking. However, I don't believe a law is a right. The DOI would imply that the fetus would get the right to ' life '. However, I don't think the DOI was referring to abortion at the time written<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Oh I forgot! That    s how they used    men    back then, to mean mankind. Of course they were too uneducated to write what they meant. They were Neanderthals who only spoke in monosyllables.

And they were also visionally impaired because they couldn    t see that blacks were    men    who belonged in the group    mankind   . Maybe they took a vote and 6 out of 10 of them said the blacks were not men and 4 out of 10 said they were so they decided that a black was 3/5 ths of a human. Maybe they were just stoned.

If it were and there was a history of males in your family being homosexual, would you consider aborting a male fetus and trying to have a daughter instead?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Perhaps. But that it isn't necessarily the case. And it also depends heavily on how one defines the concept of a " perfectly valid medical reason " for doing so. I suppose you and I will disagree on this point.

No. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I am glad to know that you are pro-choice. Nobody would ( at this time ) force you to have an abortion. Isn't freedom wonderful?

Now, if you want to have a reasonable discussion, I am all for it. Otherwise, you can count me out. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Ah but its been done in China for example thus removing choice. And the opposite was done in Romainia you know. All my discussions are reasonable - if sometimes abrasive and Socratic. \<br><b> S2:3-  </b>In it's common usage, a person who is pro-choice supports allowing individuals to decide whether to abort a child or not ( although they are mysteriously not pro-choice about various other things ). Now, when you asked me if I would consider abortion to be justifiable in the circumstance you cited, I said, " No. " That is, it is not justifiable for anyone to abort a child in the second trimester for that reason. You have a knack for shifting the scope of the discussion. I am not talking about Romania or China. I am talking about the United States, you know, the place in the world where abortion has the least amount of legal restrictions. I have noticed that most of your posts in this thread are laced with little but sophistry. For example, just in your last two posts to me you tried to change the meaning of a very common phrase, and you also tried to shift the scope of the discussion. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>First of all a fetus in the second trimester is NOT a child. By definition a child is a human being living outside the body of its mother. Children must be born. Yes you said no and thus exercised your choice thank you very much. For you its not reasonable to abort and you are entitled to that choice. You are not entitled to choose for anyone else however. There are plenty of sex linked diseases which affect only one gender, some of them pretty awful. An abortion of the fetus due to its likelyhood of being badly diseased is rational to me and if faced with the problem I would evaluate the situation as best I could and choose what to do. I appreciate your allowing me to do so as I accord the same right to you. Those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it. Both Romainia and China are relevant to what denial of choice can end up looking like. You are entitled to your opinion IMHO.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>You seem to be upset that I used the word " child " in a way you perceive to be uncommon. Interesting. No. I said it would not be ethical for anyone to abort a fetus on the grounds that the child is likely to inherit a particular trait. That's not an exercise of choice. It is the expression of an opinion. And additionally, that opinion says nothing about whether one should be able to exercise a particular choice. I am perfectly entitled to prevent another person from killing a fetus for trivial reasons. You have not given a sufficient reason as to why I may not do this. Actually, you have not given any reason as to why I may not do this. Though it may be rational it is not ethical, and therefore you should not be permitted to do it. Sophistry. It is quite interesting that you have to appeal to the history of other countries. Why is that? Oh yeah. It is because when you examine United States history ( a history that has traditionally prohibited abortion ), you cannot find one example of someone being forced by the government to obtain an abortion. So what you offer is an argument that looks reasonable at first glance, but when it is examined we find it is just sophistry. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>And there we have it. You claim a right which you do not in fact hold. You would force your opinion on others. To what extent would you go? Would you kill the provider of abortion services? Would you bomb abortion clinics? Would you incarcerate the mother in a prison to prevent her from doing whats legal? Where would you sto in asserting your right to prevent what is at this time a perfectly legal action???? Bear in mind that the current law does NOT require any reason at all for a womans choice, it can be totally arbitrary! I can see that you are not interested in being rational, only in being in control of other peoples lives and choices.

We are speaking mostly of 16 and 17 year old girls. Many of which cars and jobs. However that is beside the point. I would normally agree with you on other medical procedures, because of these reasons. This is an exception, as I have stated above. This is the case where parents will act more immature by either forcing their daughter to have or to not have the abortion against her wishes.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Well then you should have specified what age range you were referring to. I don't consider it to be beside the point at all. If there's the threat of abuse and evidence can confirm or at least support this accusation, then the authorities should be notified and the abuser removed immediately. Suggesting that parents not be notified because it might lead to abuse is stupid in my opinion. They're going to know something is up when there's a sizable amount of money missing, or if complications arise and hospitalization is necessary. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I am referring to all ages. Its just most common in 16 to 17 year olds. I'm saying that most girls would rather have a dumpster baby or a back alley abortion than report their parents to the authorities. They will cross that bridge when they get there. Parental notification clearly violates doctor patient confidentiality. Even getting past that, the young woman in the situation is better to determine the outcome than any voter. No voter knows a girl's scenario better than herself. She can make the decision whether it is best to tell her parents or to keep it to herself. Another problem that may arise is the girl weighting whether to be parentless and stranded in the ailing foster care system, or just take the pain of the abuse. Many would choose the latter, which is why the importance of the absence of notification laws needs to be understood.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Then you should have specified that. And as we've seen most are stupid. Those that you suggest be protected are below age of consent laws in the first place. That's a rather poor attitude to have. Tarasoff v Regents of the University of California. If there's a significant threat of harm to the individual then the doctor can be held liable for remaining silent. In this case allowing the abuse to continue by not reporting it to the police. That may be true with adults. But children are incapable of knowing what's best for them, and the age of consent laws reflect that. You just said that only the individual seeking the abortion would best know how the situation affects them, now you're saying that a majority if pregnant minors would prefer to stay in an abusive family than seek help elsewhere ; a contradiction to your previous statement. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Sorry. Consent laws are about as effective as the alchohol prohibition, and that's beside the point. That doesn't change the fact that its irrelevant to the discussion. And if the doctor reports it to the parents and the patient is injured as a result the doctor can also be held liable. Some children do know whats best for them, and some parent's do not know whats best for their kids because they may be driven by political or religious motivation. That's the problem with these blanket laws. I don't see how that's a contradiction to my previous statement in any way.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So? Well then the physician certainly has a sticky situation on his hands, what you'd call one of those " catch 22 ", " damned if you do, damned if you don't ", " between a rock and a hard place " situations where no matter what decision you make it's gonna be the wrong one. If the doctor remains silent and lets the abuse to continue he can be liable for any future harm that comes to the child, if he alerts the parents and possibly the authorities then he might be liable for setting the abuse into motion and potentially getting the child killed. Some children jump off of rooftops because they think they can fly, or that an umbrella will work like a parachute and break their fall. Some children think that they can be professional wrestlers just like the people on TV and wind up killing their younger siblings in tragic accidents that could've been avoided. Then you're not looking hard enough. Either the situation is unique and nobody but the individual in question can know how to best handle it, or the situation is simplistic and anybody can tell what will happen and what's best for everyone. Which is it? <br><b>S1:4-  </b>They don't work and are therefore irrelevant to this debate. Exactly, so stop claiming one scenario is better than the other. Some adults ruin their children's lives by forcing them to have a baby. Man, you're really blindly searching for something, aren't you. Where did I say this was simplistic?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Irrelevant or not, they're still the law. Aren't you doing the exact same? Yes and some don't. Remember that. First you claimed that only the woman seeking the abortion could possibly know the best for the situation, that no voter could ever comprehend what would be going through her mind. Then you claimed that a child would rather live with abusive parents that beat them instead of running away for their own safety, as if you know everything that goes through their minds, or like you can predict the future and know exactly what will happen. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>A different law. Are you sure you're in the right debate forum? No, you see I'm advocating for the person that has to deal with the situation to decide for themselves. America is so great. But some still do. Remember not to screw them while making laws. You misunderstood. I said meant some if not most children may choose to take the beating instead of lose their only parents. In any case, this is not a situation we want to be putting young women in.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8059_11_10__16_17_19_38_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I am for notification on other medical procedures, however abortion is different. There are many parents out there who are more immature than their daughters, and are abusive. Parental consent is not as much about a parent's right to know a it is keeping young women out of harms way. Unfortunately, not all minors are as mature as I, and not all parents are as good as mine, and therefore it would be dangerous to pregnant adolescents to subject them to this kind of potential harm, as AO mentioned. This is also a highly controversial issue, and it is not right to forcibly subject a minor to the political views of her parents.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>If a child comes in for an abortion and fears abuse from her parents then law enforcement should be notified. The only people protected by opposing notification laws are abusers and pedophiles. No elective, invasive medical proceedure should be performed on a child without the consent of a parent or judge. If a minor is allowed to have an abortion without consent the parents / guardians will have no idea whats been done to this child should complications arise, they wouldn't be able to give this information to a ER doctor or the childs pediatrition. I've heard this type of statment before and it doesn't seem to hold water. Opposing abortion is not a political view, its a moral view and children are subject to their parents moral views from day one until they are adults. Its called parenting. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Wrong. The people who are opposed to notification laws are trying to keep our young girls safe. A child may not want to tell law enforcement about her being abused because of fear of her parents. The only people who support notification laws are affiliated with the coat hanger companies. I agree, however this is a rare and serious exception. Children don't fear abuse, or their relationship with their parents being complicated from your garden variety surgery. No, its a political view. Something that the whole country is deadlocked over is not a " family value ". No one should be forcibly subjected to anyone's political view, regardless of what name you may give that political view.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>That doesn't even make sense. How do you help an abused young girl stay safe by making sure the abuser doesn't get reported? Putting the abuser in jail is what will help that girl stay safe and reporting the abuser to law enforcment is what will put them in jail. Lets say the 14 year old girl was impregnated by a pedophile, your theory is definitely going to be to his liking. Complications from abortion are hardly rare. As to when a child fears abuse, your giving abusers way too much credit. Your implying that there is some logic to the abuse. They don't need a reason, the fact that it's a day ending in Y is good enough. I will go so far as to say its both. In my case for instance I oppose abortion ( in most cases ) on a moral level. Because of that I also oppose it when I'm voting. These two things are not mutually exclusive. The bottom line is this : A child that isn't mature enough to decide to see an R-rated movie is certainly not mature enough to make major, elective, medical decisions. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I want to know how giving her abusers more reason to abuse her makes sense too. Lets say the girl was a victim of incest. With that logic, why don't all abused kids immediately report their parents? Complications from not having an abortion are just as common. I'm also saying that a young woman being abused would most likely rather stick a coat hanger up her vagina than report her abusive parents. The opinion that abortion is a moral issue is also a political view. Of course they're old enough to see R rated movies. How many kids over 12 do you know that haven't? I would normally agree with you, however this is an exception. In many cases, the parents will act just as if not more stupid than the parents. We also must separate this debate from the debate that of whether abortion should be legal or not. This debate is soley to determine the best course for our young and pregnant women.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Couple of problems with this statment. First, abusers don't need a reason. Second, if the abuser is reported to law enforcement it would make her safer then allowing the abuser to remain anonymous and free to abuse again. Lets say she is. Why are you so determined to make sure he gets the chance to do it again. If law enforcment had to be notified in lew of parents they could put the pediphile under the jail. Because they are kids. They don't know any better. Which is why we should be doing everything possible to see that law enforcment gets involved. Speculation, any evidence to back it? Your big mistake in this statement was the word opinion. For me, and many others, abortion is a moral issue, no opinion about it. I agree, it would however seem to me that you are having a hard time seperating the two. You agree that children are not mature enough to make decisions about elective, invasive medical proceedures except in the case of abortion. Read : except where it differs with your " political views ". I have come out consistantly on the side of notification, if not parental then law enforcment. I base this argument on the childs maturity level and ability to make medical decisions, as opposed to " political views ".</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8252_167_164__171_181_183_185_186_190_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>I don't need to portray aggressiveness for any reason... but it is with the clarity of conviction I can assert and speak plainly to a given matter... because the knowledge of what is right is underneath it... not what is comfortable for me spout.

I don't think liberals are stupid, they just show us everyday they aren't smart... tomorrow's a new day buddy. How about some of that change Kool Aid you're probably high on. Secondly " opended minded " doesn't mean open to depravity... it is just more co-opted language by the left. See minds like yours believe emphatically that to be open minded [ to you ] is to lower the standard. No, it is not... But to answer your question, there are gay republicans, haven't met a gay conservative yet... but there are gay republicans. Tammy Bruce... Al Rantel, the Log Cabin Republicans [ go figure ] - see we can almost all get along! Lastly... right and wrong is not a concept that can be bartered in the halls of academia or in the back of coffeehouses, it is a universal understanding... the knowledge of which is written on all our hearts, we know right from wrong and the voice in American politics that lauds lawlessness can't lie to all the people all the time. So once again you proven to the world you a the living, breathing 2nd law of thermodynamics.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Since you are so sure that universal ideas of right and wrong exist, kindly post a single example of an act that has been considered wrong at all times, in all places, and by all people.

Your idiocy is profound only as your ignorance.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>1. The Death Penalty is judicially supported murder. 2. Jean Valjean proved the idiocy of this. 3. Jewish law at one time required brother #2 to impregnate the wife of brother #1. 4. In many societies around the world ( The Scottish clans spring instantly to mind. ), and up until recent times, men were required to abduct their wives and, whether the women involved were willing or not, to have intercourse with them.

NEXT??!! <br><b>S1:4-  </b>to support the nonsense you believe is so socially valuable... Now let's pick this lunacy apart point by point.

Who gives a flying left toenail about what French relativist thinks? I am not bound by Valjean's humanistic machinations. Unliess you are living as an Orthodox Jew, or Christian... don't quote what you dont ' live for. You have no clue what you are talking about... so zip it. That statement is irrelevant to the whole point. Like Chris Rock said... there are some things I'm liberal about, and something I am conservative about. I can be completely candid there. But the one thing I cannot be liberal about are things that effect society as a whole... you on the other hand just have a hole in your head.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Not irrelevant at all, silly child. You posted four of what you thought were universals. All that I di was to show that each and every one of them is not as universal as you thought they were. Your argument stands demolished!!! Thus proving once again that neo-conservatism is bankrupt. BTW, do not tell me it " zip it " unless and until you can demonstrate that you are the net nanny. Your final statement once again proves what right thinking people knew all along ; scratch a rightie, find an angry hater every time. BTW, Lincoln should have thrown Robert E. " Traitor " Lee in the brig the second he resigned his command to commit treason against his country. At least he lived long enough to see his slave plantation confiscated for a cemetery for those who diesd to help put the traitorous South back under the Federal boot. For the good of the USA and to prove that Americans are forgiving people, our leaders might be getting around to pulling Federal troops out of the traitorous South sometime soon.. The Southerners needed a proper chastisement for having the temerity to commit treason against their country.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-8252_61_55__82_83_102_103_108_112_117_118_124_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Because your facts are so backed up.

In any event, a simple dictionary shows that the word human or term human being can be defined as ' homo sapian ' and since a fetus is a homo sapian ( and not another species ), one can easily say a fetus is a human. This is really not in dispute. In fact, the mountains of evidence presented before you from others is just written off by you showing your ignorance. What are you asking in this post?

I shall take the following statement as representative of what I mean : " There are no objective moral truths. " The problem with that statement is that it is self-contradictory. It is a claim about moral truth that must be objectively true to have any meaning. But if it is true, it cannot have any meaning. If it is true, then the statement logically must be false. Now, I don't know your view on this idea of moral relativism. I do not know whether your view is the strong relativist position ( there are no moral truths ) or the soft relativist position ( there may be moral truths, but we cannot know them ). It is very hard to have a discussion about any subject with a person who adheres to the strong relativist position because he already demonstrates that he is willing to dogmatically adhere to a self-contradictory idea. If one is willing to embrace a contradiction here, what is to keep him from accepting a self-contradictory idea there? Such a posture renders discussion meaningless and useless.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Instead of continuing to play your usual Jesuitical word games, why not gove us an example of a universal moral truth. The guidelines for universality ate that the " truth " you proclaim to be " universal " have to have been accepted as true by all people at all times and in all locations. Remember that a single disproof causes your system to collapse like the house of cards it is. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>I've done this several times before, chester. And these are not word games. The one playing word games is the person who insists that the position based solely upon a logical contradiction is the rational position. That, of course, is not what " universally true " means. In fact, the definition of a " universal truth " is something that is true independent of what people happen to believe about it. It is something that would be true even if every person were sure that it was false. It seems you are the one prone to word games. That is not surprising because you certainly don't want to have to confront the fact that your entire ethical worldview is based upon a logical contradiction, and compels the conclusion that nothing -- absolutely nothing -- can be immoral. Do you really think that just because one person might disagree with a proposition, therefore the proposition is false? In that case, I disagree with everything you ever have said. It must be, then, that everything you ever have said has been false, no?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Still tap dancing, we see. If you have stated things previously, why not own up to them and either restate them here and now or provide a link to your writing? One person SAYING some this is false does not make it so ; one person DEMONSTRATING that a purported " universal truth " is untrue makes it false. As others have put it so well, morality is a social construct, nothing more, nothing less. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>It is not my responsibility to do the legwork for you. But I did anyway. The conversation between myself and you that began here : http://www.4forums.com/political/abo...tml#post307133. This was back when you were travelling these parts under the name " bhbcu 64. " I'm sure you remember that. And how, exactly, do you purport to demonstrate that the statement " murder is objectively wrong " is false?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I don't have to. You did a remarkably good job of it when you said that it was moral for a mother to smother her infant to death if its cries would alert guards that the mother, the child, and others were in the process of escaping from a concentration camp. Your objectve morality there seems to be a Benthamite utilitarian statement about the greatest good for the great 4 est number. Now, let's see you play your usual Jesuitical word games and try to describe the mother's act as " not murder. " <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I'm afraid I don't recall ever saying that. Surely if I said it, you could produce some evidence, right? Except that I reject utilitarianism. You seem to enjoy putting words in people's mouths. Or do you only do that when you cannot defend the words that come out of yours?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-4085_53_51__54_55_56_57_60_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>no, it doesn't say rights for a reason. Equal protection under the law means you can't say one group is allowed to be murdered while the others have the protection of the " do not muder " law. I guess if laws are rights to you then you can say that. The Supreme Court doesn't get many income tax law cases. Once again, save it for another forum. You have no idea how many cases I have read ;) nonono, if our standard is going to be the dictionary then a human is a person and a fetus is a human. I will agree with all of the above then. If the fetus is a person then Roe vs Wade get overturned ( as stated in the case ) and thus the state laws on the books will go back to what they were and the killing the fetus would be the " unlawful killing of a person ". So yeah, I'll admit to being wrong via the dictionary assuming thats our standard. http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=person A living human http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=human A member of the genus Homo and especially of the species H. sapiens.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Steeeeve, Brilliant, so you agree that we all have an equal right to life, otherwise what is the basis for laws against murder. If I did not have the right to live, then murdering me could not be against the law and laws passed against murdering me would be unconstitutional because murder would not be a violation of my rights. Why don    t you check the Supreme Court docket for 2005. You may find more than one case regarding taxes was heard and decided. Check your facts before you make a statement. Unsubstantiated statements undermine everything else you say. Based on your statement that the Supreme Court doesn    t get many cases on tax law, I have a good idea how many cases you have read. Is it 2 or 3? So, simply put, a pregnant woman who iingests anything ( alcohol, drugs, poison, etc. ), thereby causing harm ( brain damage say ) to the human fetus she is carrying is guilty or harming a person. Do you agree with that? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>No its, true. I wouldn't say it otherwise. We don't need to agree about this here, however, most tax cases are heard in ' tax court ' and rarely get up to the Supreme court level. The mainly only hear cases are of " serious issue " or that conflict between circuit courts. ( source : Concepts in Federal Taxation 2006 Edition ; Murphy & Higgins ) Why are you so quick to ask another question? Are you saying what I said was correct? I want to know if our standard is dictionary definitions.. answer that then I will answer yours.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Try Grable & Sons Metal Products v. Darue Engineering, or Bllard v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service, or Comm    r v. Banks They were all this year.

I didn't say there were none. I said not many. Considering thats only three out of the many tax cases heard by the US Tax Code court I would say the Supreme Court doesn't hear that many. I don't think the Ballard case was about Income Tax either. Why won't you answer my question? I want to know if we are on the same level with regards to dictionary definitions before I will answer yours... so whats it gonna be?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>That was 3 cases out of eighty. There were only three other subjects that took a greater percentage of the court's docket. Maybe I am unclear. I thought I posted the thread where we agreed on terms and dictionary definitions. What words do you think we are still unclear on? Please include your definitions and I will let you know if I take issue with any of them <br><b>S1:4-  </b>3 outta 80 with one not even being about the income tax ( which was the orginal point ). We had 2 on the 10 commandments alone and thats not even a ' big ' thing. However, I see it has the Supreme court took 3 outta the insane amount of tax cases heard in tax court. ANd looking at it that way will show that the Supreme Court barely touches the issue. They only tend to look at it for the reasons I stated a few posts up. The dictionary definitions I was referring to would be the ones about person and human... just basic definitions and I thought that if we accept your definition then we have to accept mine as they are from the same source.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-3000_173_172__174_175_176_178_179_180_184_6<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Sure, adherence to " God's law " serves but one purpose, it is an insurance policy for one's soul ( assuming one has one ) against those laws being for real.

So which to superceed the other : insurance policy or a means to a functional society?

Now that i have pointed out that a natural law exists and you know that it exists ( because you hopefully believe as i do that hitler was a terrible person ) let me ask you a question.. who created this natural law? it certainly isnt manmade! <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Nope, you have invented something there missing from my statement : Hilter's laws were far from OK. They were inherently greater than any " god's law " that may or may not exist though - you had that bit right. What? I most certainly do not " know " that any " natural law " exists, quite the opposite. It doesn't exist therefore who or what created it is irrelevent.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>You obviously do know that some law is a standard in coming to the conclusion that hitler was wrong in his actions.. Who created that conviction within you?? and who created the fact that the things he was doing were wrong?? SOMEONE HAD TO and it wasnt any man.. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Very true, it was a woman : my mother. She taught me the basic " right from wrong " that forms the moral base, and thus the laws, of my society. It is because Hilter's actions were so out of kilter with the morals of my society that they are judged to be so wrong by that society and thus by me. There is no " some law is a standard in coming to the conclusion that hitler was wrong in his actions " or to put it in English : Hilter's actions were not intrinsicly wrong, they are just judged to be wrong by the standards of most of the modern world.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Your logic here really scares me. If his actions werent intrinisicly wrong, i guess there is no absolute that we are morally right to judge him. Thats according to you.. And by the way, where did your mother get those convictions from?? and beyond.. there is something in every human heart that knows murder is wrong, stealing is wrong, and so forth. Who created that is what i wanna know.. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>That is correct. We are free to judge him, but there is no absolute against which we can judge him. The only thing in my heart is blood. I use my head for such matters and I know that not every human head holds that murder is wrong, stealing is wrong and that not every human head agrees on what murder and theft are. You should try using your head, rather than a blood pump, for thinking one day and you too could ditch this silly notion of absolute morality governing the human race.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>So if there is no absolute morality, i can go kill someone and claim " OH even though the government says its wrong, i can still do it because there is no moral certainty that its not wrong!

I am merely explaining simple reality for a few confused people. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes, you say the basis for morality is society. I disagree and do not accept such a whimsical basis that has no principle nor produces any reason to value anything.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>If you wish to adopt such a " Flat Earther " approach to the matter, that is your choice. It's hardly the first time that I've come across a religious person refusing to accept reality and it will not be that last. Have a nice life now. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I fail to see how your approach is an adoption of reality. Your basis does not produce a logical reason why I should value anything. It is a worldview that adopts an absolute moral standard that produces the highest value on human life. I'm afraid that one consequence of a subjective moral system is that it is indeed not possible to say that what Hitler did was intrinsically wrong. Why should I adopt such a worldview that will not allow me to logically say that what Hitler did was intrinsically wrong?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Oh well. Keep trying and you will get there one day. Assuming of course that " absolute moral standard " places a high value on human life. No existing claimed " absolute moral standard " achieves this even remotely. This is correct. And round and round we go. You are not required to " adopt " anything. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>The absolute standard I have referred to over and over is one in which the highest value is placed on human life. Therefore I can say with certainty and quite logically that what Hitler did was intrinsically wrong.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>That is indeed a laudible moral standard to aspire to. You delude yourself in thinking that it is absolute though. You can ( quite correctly IMO ) say that what Hitler did was wrong, but you are incorrect when you claim it was intrinsically wrong. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Not according to an absolute moral standard that places the highest value on human life. The only reason I keep replying is because I want people to understand just where the relativist postion leads. Under moral relativism, we can't say that child molestation, genocide, racism, slavery, or anything is intrisically wrong ( you have said as much ). Therefore, under moral relativism there really is no reason to make laws against such things. Yet even further, there really is no reason to follow such laws should they exist. Moral relativism, if followed out to its logical conclusion, leads to anarchy and disorder where no action is justly punishable and justice has no meaning. Also, what does IMO mean? I've seen it a few times, but I must confess that I am illiterate when it comes to forum abbreviations.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>It's unfortunate that you are unable to stick to the truth therefore if you are so driven and instead must stoop to misrepresentation. Are you a creationist by any chance? This is quite blatantly untrue. To make a society work, humans need rules : we need a system of morality and we need laws. Without them, society falls apart. No your strawman leads to anarchy and disorder. It has nothing to do with morality being relative. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>Misrepresentation? What reason does a moral relativist have to establish laws, follow those laws, and punish violators of those laws? I obviously agree that we need a system of morality. Where is that morality derived from? We need a basis for establishing what is right and what is wrong. What reason does a moral relativist have to establish laws, follow those laws, and punish violators of those laws?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>The term " moral relativist " is a tautology. Just " moralist " will do fine. Society needs morals to function as it must be able to judge right from wrong to function as a society. That basis will vary depending upon the circumstances ( and prior beliefs / tranditions ) of that society. It's a society that has the need to " establish laws, follow those laws, and punish violators of those laws " etc. A moralist merely philosophises about morals. <br><b>S1:7-  </b>What if I don't want to subscribe to my culture's morality, but instead want to subscribe to another culture's morals? A society has to adopt some moral standard to establish laws and punish lawbreakers. We keep coming back to the same thing : where does this standard derive from?<br><b> S2:7-  </b>Then you, broadly speaking, have the following choices : Rebel and risk punishment Seek to change your culture's morality to better fit the other's.

I am not sure if I have gotten a real answer yet.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>The Supreme Court ruling is brought up to as a legal argument, not as a justification. Yes, part of the debate is whether abortions are " right ". The argument is not for the " right to do whatever she wants with her own body ", but that none have the right to do whatever they wish to hers. No, it is that you do not understand pro-choice arguments. Steve, That is because your question is nonsense. The gov't does not have the power to prevent you from having one. It is often spoken of as a " right to abortion " because we have the right to do things even if the gov't does not wish us to. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yeah, but you don't have the right to kill someone, you don't have the right to steal, you don't have the right to do cocaine. The government makes a lot of things illegal. I agree, the constitution puts limits on the government... however, they said nothing about abortion. So where did the right come from... since I guess we are assuming it from the government<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Agreed, the Constitution says nothing about abortion. However, the Constitution does say that any powers not given to the gov't the Federal Gov't does not have. The Federal Gov't does not have the power to regulate pregnancy. It came from the Constitution. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>So it would then go to the States I don't recall anything in the consitution that says that. Where does the constitution say you have the " right to abortion " or whatever you wish to call it.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Agreed, and it is a State issue. I simply feel compelled to point out a national ban is unconstitutional.... I'm trying to decide if you're this dense on purpose. I didn't say we had a right to abortion, I said the Constitution doesn't allow the Federal Gov't to restrict it. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>But then a national ban on banning would be unconstitutional too. Thus Roe vs Wade would be wrong. My mistake... I got that you meant that from the following.... See where I got that idea now? So I am still wondering where the right comes from then. I don't think you are suggesting that you have a right to everything unless it is restricted are you?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>That's an interesting argument. What is your support for this? If a state made a law banning guns, was challenged and the case went to the Supreme Court and the Court struck down that law it would in effect place a ban on banning guns. This is a perfectly valid use of their power, and is not legislating by any stretch of the imagination. Keep in mind you cannot use the support of an unproven point ( " substantive due process is wrong! " ) to support this argument. In a sense you do. If there is no law forbidding an action and you do that action, who is to say it was illegal? <br><b>S1:5-  </b>This gets into the " where do rights come from " arguement... and I honestly don't wanna do that again. I will leave that to Cone or Chloe or something. lol, substantive due process is no where in the constitution, however, I don't believe I was thinking along those lines. See a " ban on guns " is a something clearly stated in the constitution ( as in your right to have a gun ). However, the 2nd amendment says nothing about Congress not being able to restrict what guns you can have. ANyway, if something is not address in the constitution it is said to go the states.. this is the case with abortion. So to rule on it one way or the other is unconstitutional. I think you can't put a ban on abortion ( as in court case ) because it says nothing in the constitution about being allowed to do that... same goes with a ban on banning. Hopefully that clear up my point :p</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10995_18_17__19_20_21_24_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Nope, it's divine judgment for continuing wickedness. Have you ever read the Bible, pappi? Genesis 15 : - 12 As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him. 13 Then the Lord said to him,    Know for certain that for four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own ( Egypt ) and that they will be enslaved and mistreated there. 14 But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions. 15 You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age. 16 In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites ( and Canaanites, etc. ) has not yet reached its full measure.

Divine Judgement is separate from the penalty, in the case of an individual that person is killed, when God murders or causes to be enslaved the innocent with the guilty Christians somehow turn this into being just, I guess just casualties of war, wrong place wrong time. To eradicate an entire people is genocide, whether they deserved it or God justified it doesn't change what it is. The reality is there were a few hundred thousand militant Hebrews who needed a place to live and couldn't take on Egypt to the south, couldn't survive in the desert to the East, no boats to cross the ocean to the west and had a fertile region populated by a group of city states independent of each other in decline. So they decided to conquer and what better way to do this than by declaring God commanded it. He had said he would give them the land, not he would make them fight for it. Now do you think you would like to try answering the questions asked that relate to this thread? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You're still deluded. The children of the baby killers grow up into baby killers themselves. Just like the anti-Israel Muslims, who raise up their children to hate and kill Jews. Here's another flash for you. God    s Judgment Saves Lives How many people would 100 evil men kill in their lifetimes? Let's say a thousand, and the 100 evil men wind up in hell when they die. Now, let's let those 100 evil men have 100 offspring that over time grow up to kill the original 1,000 other people, plus 1,000 more. Now, you have 200 evil men in hell and 2,000 murdered others. Let's take it to the 10th or so generation. Now you've had 10,000 evil men giving birth to 10,000 offspring and together those 20,000 evil men and or women offspring kill 200,000 people total. So, you now have 20,000 evil men and women in hell ( vs. 100 if you had nailed them earlier ), plus 200,000 other dead people. So God, being smarter than his critics, and able to see consequences further out in time than the stiff-necked " God is evil " crowd, saves 19,900 people from going to hell plus he saves 199,000 others from getting murdered. ( please excuse any math errors ). Get the picture? God SAVES!!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Your picture needs to be adjusted. You are so intent on being right you fail to really understand what you say. Let's say you have 10 cities and each has 1,000 people. Of those each city has 100 evil people, but that leaves 900 people who are good or neutral, not good, but not evil. You want to solve the problem of the evil people by killing everybody, which includes the 100 innocent people in each city ( total 900 ). So how much good did you wipe off the planet with the death of the good people and how much evil did you create with the indiscriminate slaughter of the remaining population? Now the truth of the matter is the Israelites needed some place to go and live. So they went back to the place of their ancestors. When they discovered that the wilderness of Sin wasn't as nice as that of their Semitic neighbors they decided since Abraham had moved there and they all came from him they would say they came from there also. The best motivator for a people of the time was religion, so God was used to justify their conquest and genocide. If killing the evil people is what God believes the smartest way to go, why does he prohibit it now? Now you want to get back to the point of the thread?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-10385_16_8__18_19_20_21_22_23_24_25_26_27_28_29_30_33_34_35_36_37_38_1<br><b>S1:1-  </b>This where you become annoying. I never said the mother should have no choice at all, I said if the fetus feels stress during a termination then it should be considered a sentient human being. This means that there are two sentient human beings to consider not one. Why are you not capable of reading a simple post? I am not ' content a judgement for every woman out there '. I have given my opinion. You seem a little hormonal today... or am I making a false assumption like you did?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Do you have an opinion on the fact she was denied access to abortion? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes I think that it is an incredibly sad situation. I think that abortion is perfectly acceptable until the fetus is developed enough to suffer during termination then at least some consideration should be shown to that suffering. A few days ago a woman a few miles away from me gave birth to a 22 week old fetus and begged the hospital to try to help the baby. They just told her that they cannot even try to help a baby that was born before 24 weeks. The baby died in the mothers arms. If this baby was developed enough to live a few minutes in its mothers arms then there is a chance it would be developed enough to feel pain and / or distress. I suppose the most convenient thing to do is just rip the fetus apart and put it in the incinerator. Who cares if the fetus suffers for a few minutes? Hell, we are talking about womens rights here. The congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says it knows of no legitimate evidence showing a fetus can ever experience pain but as I stated before, the very same body of proffessionals had no evidence that new borns felt pain either. Apparently they do.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>At some point you have to believe someone unless you plan to doubt everything that group has to say about anything. Since the mechanism to be conscious of pain, by the evidence, doesn't form until the third trimester, would you think it's reasonable to say that this woman shouldn't be barred from abortion until then? <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If the mechanism to be conscious of pain / distress does not form until the third trimester then it would be unreasonable to say that the woman should not terminate the child. Can a Fetus Feel Pain? U.K. Report Says No. - Newsweek Some say they do, some say they dont..... Do you believe that mother should be able to terminate the child after the third trimester?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>I believe abortion should be allowed until premature birth is easier on the woman. I don't know when that point is, but I assume it exists. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Even if the fetus suffers pain / distress?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Yes. I think the woman is of paramount importance in the pregnancy relationship. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Fair enough. You believe that we should not give the potential suffering of the fetus any consideration and I think we should. All clear now.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Not quite, but close enough I suppose. I think the suffering of the fetus deserves consideration, but that consideration to the woman should and does outweigh it. If the fetus deserved no consideration, then I would accept abortion until birth. You seem to believe the opposite, that the suffering of the fetus outweighs the suffering of the woman. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>I have said all along that the suffering of the fetus should be considered whereas you have only stated this in your last post. Glad you have seen sense at<br><b> S2:6-  </b>lol, you didn't ask until that last post whether the fetus deserves consideration, so why would I state it before then? <br><b>S1:7-  </b>Because it was an fundamental part of the debate. I stressed the fetus needs consideration from the beginning wheras you did not mention it until pressed. You seemed not care at all about the suffering of the fetus in the above posts. Then you back pedalled.....<br><b> S2:7-  </b>I was asking your opinion on it :-\ When you asked me my opinion on it I gave it, saying the woman was the most important participant. Then you mentioned the fetus specifically I clarified, saying that it deserves consideration, but reiterated that the woman was the most important participant. You're creating dark corners where they don't exist :P <br><b>S1:8-  </b>There are no dark corners, just you trying to cover your tracks lol. You stated that abortion should be allowed until premature birth is easier on the WOMAN. Even if the fetus suffers suffers pain / stress because the woman is paramount in the pregnancy relationship. Then when I pointed out you do not believe that the suffering of the fetus should have any consideration... which you clearly expressed... you back pedalled.... Dont get me wrong. I am glad that you see sense ;)<br><b> S2:8-  </b>I don't think you and I have the same definition of backpeddling. I never said the fetus should get no consideration, so accusing me of having that position at any point is dishonest. The fact that the woman's needs should be more important does not even imply that the fetus is unimportant. <br><b>S1:9-  </b>You mentioned that the woman needs should be paramount without mentioning how much consideration the fetus should have. You answer to my question of should the fetus be aborted even if it suffered was.. yes. I will will change ' backpedalling ' to ' weasel words '.. hows that?<br><b> S2:9-  </b>That's correct, I didn't tell you until you asked what consideration was owed the fetus :P So your accusation about my belief is incorrect, and continuing that charge is dishonest. Weasel words has an actual definition. In what way was anything I said part of that definition? <br><b>S1:10-  </b>When I asked if the fetus should be aborted even if it felt pain / distress you said YES. Your weasel words are the ambiguous and quibbling use of them by you then and after. Should I change it to dishonest? Your belief was that the fetus should be terminated even if it suffered, if the mother required it. Dont lie and say you<br><b> S2:10-  </b>That's correct, because concerns of the woman are more important than the consideration I would give the fetus. That isn't the same thing as saying " the fetus deserves no consideration " which is what you dishonestly assigned to me. What was ambiguous about anything I said? <br><b>S1:11-  </b>Aborting the fetus even if it suffers is giving no consideration to it.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7918_315_313__329_333_334_335_7<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The simple fact is that people don't want the immense responsibility that logically pertains to their voluntary actions actions, so they fabricate denials of reality as a convenient escape, out of pure selfishness -- like every other atrocity in history. The study of law includes an analysis of how people excuse their wrongdoings, fabricating pausible rationalizations for their acting to benefit at another's expense ; denial is typically the first of these, claiming that the act " does not hurt anyone, " however obvious the contrary. Other rationales follow, such as self-preservation, natural right to act, and eventually growing defensive by blaming the victim. While the fabricator typically believes his story original, it is anything but -- it's simply the inevitable course of selfishness.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>OMG. Here we go again. Please tell us on what basis the state is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is. What theory of law would you use to support your point? Hypothetical situation : Roe is overturned, returning control over abortion to the states. State " A " bans abortions ; state " B " permits them under most circumstances. 1. What sanction does State " A " put in place to punish those who have abortions within its borders? Upon whom is the sanction applied? The woman? The doctor? 2. How does state " A " prevent its citizens from traveling to state " B " to have the abortion performed? 3. How will state " A " determine that one of its citizens has traveled to state " B " to have the abortion performed? 4. Can state " A " punish one of its citizens for traveling to state " B " to have a legal act performed on her? 5. By what claim of right is any man entitled to an opinion on the question? After you finish those, Joel, I have a few more for you. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Yes, it seems you never learn, so I have no hope of educating you, and absolutely no intention. Since you ask nicely, the answer is " Supreme soveriegn authority ", i.e. the fact that governments are established among men to secure their basic rights -- i.e. they not left to individual whims to respect or violate as each pleases, in the model of classic anarchy. States are thus delegated by their People, with the power to to protect these rights through laws. I believe we've gone over this before ; you didn't understand it then, I doubt you will now... or ever. It's still true, however : ignorance is never disproof. If you form your own nation, you can name yourself the sovereign and construe the laws however you choose ; however that's neither here nor there.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>So then you admit that the same " Supreme Sovereign authority " to which you would give the power to ban abortions today would be the same SSA to which you would give the power to require them in the future. Sorry, but we do not live in Jean Jacques Rousseau's world of the General Will. Rather, we live in the world of Locke's Social Contract. Now, try taking an equally impotent stab at the other questions. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>And pregnancy is a social contract between man, woman and child, Mr. Pseudo-intellectual. The sovereign ENFORCES the social contract of proximate responsibility for free choice, otherwise it's anarchy -- as is patently obvious to anyone with an ounce of common sense. YOU'RE the one pushing the " General Will, " by arrogating plebiscite defensive rationalization of general WHIM. Go take an impotent stab at your mom, I'm done with you.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>So sad. When your quiver quivers for the lack of the arrows of substance, thast you revert to vile ad hominems. Then again, not entirely unexpected ; righties do tend to carry a lot of anger in that quiver in lieu of arrows.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7918_644_641_2_659_668_672_680_682_685_688_695_704_728_22<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Whoever says such things is ignorant. Every abortion is done by a rapist. Anyone who allows an abortion is either a rapist or has been raped. Rape in its true meaning is to plunder, or to take wrongfully. It literally means to seize or take by force. Furthermore, it is an outrageous assault. Every baby aborted has been violated, and outrageously assaulted. How many lives have been taken by the force of the cunning currette? It is a practice we must stop. Every mother who has been to Planned Parenthood for counseling on a surprise or crisis pregnancy is the victim of fraud and her baby has been taken away by force ; which is rape. In my mother's case, when she refused to kill her own child, it was extraordinary because in today's world two rapes will make right. It is a lie. The Feminist for Life counselors counsel women pregnant as a result of sexual rape, and as these mothers receive counselling and support, they see the humanity of their children and are more at peace about giving them life. It is a wonderful thing to love instead of increase the violence. Abortion is plunder of the child's entire life and the woman's soul.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>You cannot plunder what does not yet exist. Nor is a soul a matter of fact, either. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Do you exist?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>At present, yes. Not as a blastocyst, however. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>You were once a blastocyst. You exist, and so what is your purpose in life? Jesus died for all and loves all that he has made. He gives life and life abundantly to all who believe in Him.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>No, I was not. Nor was I once a gleam in someone's eye. Nor does that detract anything from my inherent worth as a human being who exists, at present. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Were you conceived?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>A human egg was fertilized. Eventually this develops into a person with an identity. In my case, who I am, today. But everything else you're putting on this is your own religious faith. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Everyone has an identity, everyone possesses traits of individuality. Everyone conceived is different and individual from everyone else conceived. You were conceived and eventually you will die.<br><b> S2:5-  </b>Eventually, " I " as an entity began to conceive -- that is, " I " came into being. Though whether I was conceived -- as in act of intelligence by another -- is a question of faith. There was a fertilized egg -- that's all we can agree upon. And there is an awful lot of " coding ", if you will, in a fertilized egg. But " coding " is not a person at a later date. I can write a play. Put it down on paper. Without the actors playing their parts, however, it's just on paper. Yes, sooner or later, I will die. Cease to exist -- just as I did not exist at an earlier state in time. Except for matters of faith. <br><b>S1:6-  </b>You can write a play, perhaps, but can you write a double-helix DNA strand and have it accurate and meaningful? The common factor present in all living organisms, from bacteria to man, is the information contained in all their cells. It hs been discovered that nowhere else can a higher statistical packing density of information be found than that found in DNA. Who is the author of this DNA?<br><b> S2:6-  </b>This is a question of faith. There may not be any " author " in this respect. And, even if there were an author, he may have signed over the copyright. The woman is the person who has to decide, " Is this a production that's going to fly or not? And whether it is or isn't, do I want to go through this? " It's quite an undertaking -- and to dictate for others.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7918_970_969_1_971_972_974_975_976_977_10<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Maybe YOU can choose to ignore the possibility you raise, but I would hope that, upon reflection, you are as frightened by the possibility you raise as I. We are currently only about 5 states away from calling a Constitutional Convention on the issue of the tax code. This has been flying under the radar for many years now. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that such a Convention could just as well pass a so-called Human Life Amendment as it could pass a Required Abortion Amendment. There simply are no rules in either the Constitution or the statutes to guide such a convention. If it fell into the control of the demagogues, we could end up with their scenario.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Given current politics, the calling of a Constitutional convention is extremely unlikely. Perhaps it might be a point that is debated in the fringe press, but it has never made it to the mainstream press in any truly visible way ( ex. more than a couple of stray articles that very few notice ). If you think this is a real current risk, then prove it by citing numerous articles from the mainstream press. I do not bother being worried about events that have a negligible chance of coming true. I concentrate my efforts on the reality that we actually currently face. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>The reality that we currently face is that you want to diminish the rights of actual women to choose whether or not to continue their pregnancies when the most that can be said about fetuses ( feti, Shooter? ) by some women is that they are at best potential people. Now, try to explain one more time why your particular POV should be law in the universe.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>Funny. When you couldn't logically address the issue currently at hand, you reverted to changing the subject back to what we had ALREADY discussed. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Quite so. I am having great difficulty understanding WHY you think your opinion should be made law in the universe? Have you ever for a moment stopped to think that perhaps you could be wrong?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Of course I know that I could be wrong but I would have to be proven wrong through rational arguement, not just claims. Have you ever stopped to think that perhaps YOU could be wrong? Either way, we already discussed this issue of whether people can have opinions about abortion law. Perhaps you are having a " senior moment " and don't remember our discussion. I really don't feel like repeating this whole discussion all over again for your benefit. Indeed, you do seem to repeat your questions quite often. If you don't like someone's answer, don't just repeat the question - address their answer. If you don't remember our discussion, it started pretty much around post #861. Unless you have something new to say that we didn't already discuss, then I think we pretty much covered it and left it at a disagreement. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Nope, this is a very different topic altogether. It deals with the egoism involved when someone attempts to make her / his opinion into a universal. Under what claim of right do you do so?<br><b> S2:4-  </b>Did you even bother to look at the discussion that started from post #861? Apparently not. Again, I gave my answers there. If you want to continue that discussion from where we ended it, or tap into some part of my answer that we did not address, fine. Otherwise, I feel no need to repeat the same answers I already gave to this same question that you pose. By the way, if you keep repeating this point in future posts without bothering to address the answers I already gave in that earlier discussion, then I will simply ignore those posts.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7918_766_764_2_774_779_781_783_787_21<br><b>S1:1-  </b>The crux of the matter when it comes to abortion, is that it is convenient    for whatever reasons. The problem arises, the moral problem that is, that what you are terminating is a process that if left to its natural conclusion would have had as a result a newborn human being. Abortion is against the nature of women, to defend it is to defend the antithesis of motherhood. The rationalisation to overcome this moral violation is to say that what one is terminating is not a human being, not a human life but an    it   . I don    t care much for the human race but I do care about suffering and that is why I am opposed to abortions that cause pain and according to the scientists, the feeling of pain begins about the end of the first trimester. If you want to commit murder, at least make sure the victim does not suffer.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>That's o.k. Everything is a natural process. Women have abortions, so it is not against their nature. Women are not only parents. There are also a number of moral issues you are ignoring related to the rights of the woman, and responsibilities and consequences to real children. Like who is taking care of the newborn I just dropped, during coffee break, before heading back out to the fields. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>False, abortion is human intervention which is not a natural process. Oh! I thought it was against their nature and that only chose abortion because they had been raped or the child was unwanted or poor things there was no one around to care of the child when born. Now you are talking. I agree on that Let's concentrate on the matter at hand<br><b> S2:2-  </b>We are part of nature. Human intervention is quite natural. Your computer terminal is natural. Why don't you just suggest that we don't intervene in the natural course of a disease? Why use medicine for anything? Why think or invent? Why drive cars? Use washing machines? Communicate on the internet? This is all so unnatural. Why are you so intent on diminishing the reasons women have abortions or determine they are not in a position to bring a child into the world? Or, should I say, why are you so out of touch? Please do. ( See above. ) Don't you think women need to make a living? Uh -- let's say dad is deceased, missing in action, in jail, absent in some respect. Ok? This is the real world, Winston. So who is going to take care of the colicky newborn after the coffee break is over? Or is life only important to you when it's something imaginary, like this sci fi movie, " The Unborn ". When it's real people, actually born, why bother, at that point? Reality is much too troublesome. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>I knew you would say that everything is natural. By the way if everything is natural ( according to you ) why bother to mention it. By natural I mean without human intervention, as in a natural death or natural birth as in not produced or changed artificially ( by human intervention ). Don    t try that semantic trick again, it doesn    t work on me. natural - definition of natural by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia. I am not I do Here you go again. I never said that life was only important when it's imaginary. Show the post where I said that. Real life? : " let's say... " " I just dropped a baby and headed for the fields... " are your jokes and hypothesis ' real life ' for you? By the way if I had made that joke about dropping the baby and heading for the fields you would have accused me of trivialising child birth, right?<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Of course you don't. You just imply it. My point was that you do trivialize having a child. Should I call you Winston McCain? After all, he's a male candidate, and more importantly, both he and Palin are opposed to abortion. I was not a Palin supporter. Our political views are too different and I think she was unqualified for office. I voted for Hillary Clinton during the primaries and for Barack Obama in the general election. Interesting that you supported them, too, from Australia. Seeing as they are both advocates, in your eyes, of mass murder. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I don't I do not. as usual putting words in my mouth I only asked if your surname was Palin, for it happened that I was reading an article about her before entering the forum and you made that remark about chopping wood and shooting a deer, kind of a Alaskan frontier woman, nothing to with politics. I do not endorse invading another country under false pretexts and causing hundred of thousands of deaths. I don    t support banning abortion although I am against it for abortions will continue to take place no matter what and under terrible conditions. Abortion was just one of many issues during the election. I also supported Hillary but it was just out of ignorance I was not aware of how intelligent and capable Obama was. He was always against the invasion of Iraq, whereas Hillary Clinton joined the victory parade before the war even started. Hillary Clinton is too Clintonesque, namely poll driven. I saw a documentary about the Germans and the Romans ( first century AD ) and how a German priestess told the German leaders not to attack the Romans but they did    She survived, most of the men did not.

I also wouldn't impose just a " mere " fine, it would be a very stiff fine so both the doctor and the patient would pay. Can you put a price on the life of a viable fetus? No, but it would serve as a major deterrent.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Nice try but not the point. I am very much of the opinion that the decision belongs to the pregnant woman and her alone. Be that as it may, I am quite proud of my adopted son. He had some difficulties as a teen, but for the past 17 years he has worked at a job he loves and which brings him respect. The point is that your proposed compromise must include a provision REQUIRING so-called righttofetallifers to adopt. That will give them a real stake in what they are preaching. For the record, how does your proposal deal with the cases where a pregnant woman travels from her home state to another to terminate her pregnancy? How do you plan to deal with the woman who cannot afford to pay the " very stiff fine ", much less raise a child? Will you have pregnancy police at the border? What powers will they have? Can you not see the Big Brother implications of your seemingly oh-so-neutral compromise? <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Chester : You appear to be the only one who wants to impose Big Brother regulations : Excuse me, but what if the pro Lifers are already responsibly rearing their own children? You're going to force them to adopt the offspring of the irresponsible? That's ridiculous. There are plenty of infertile couples in this country seeking to adopt. For God's sake, they travel to Russia and Vietnam to adopt children. Do you really think American couples would continue to spend upwards of $100,000 and deal with the red tape in those countries if there were more children available in our own country? I believe cash is good in any state of the union. Unless the woman could produce a police report evidencing rape or her home state doctor's report that the pregnancy was life-threatening ( in which case I doubt she would be traveling out of state ) she has to pay the additional fine to have the procedure performed, as does the doctor. Then that woman will carry the baby to term and her medical and legal costs to put the baby up for adoption will be offset by those who can afford to pay the fine. I'm pretty sure you know my opinion on illegal immigrants, pregnant or not. Btw Cappy, you DO know I was adopted at birth, right?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>What you call " Big Brother regulations " pale in comparison the the abhorrent concept that some nameless, faceless government bureaucrat is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is. All my compromise says is that those who protest against abortion should have some skin in the game. If they are already responsible parents, one more will not hurt a bit. If they're not, then they should keep to themselves. In the slum where I was raised, it's called putting one's self on the line. BTW, YOUR family history does not interest me in the least. What interests me is the success of my older son, whom we adopted at 4 months. For the record, we did spend the 1972 equivalent of the sum you quoted when we went to another country to adopt him another country, so don't sing that song to me. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Chester : Oh, but I have a lovely singing voice, dontcha know? Just think, my favorite little Marxist, under my proposal, you would have had your pick of healthy American babies to adopt and you could have contributed some of what you would have spent going abroad to the system that helped deliver them instead!<br><b> S2:3-  </b>There you go again, saying " Marxist " as though it were a bad thing, and as though it were relevant to this issue. BTW, there is no such term as " Pro-abortion " ; the correct term is " Pro-choice ". My point was, is, and always will be that a man has no right to an opinion on the topic ; it is a matter for the pregnant woman, in her whole discretion only.</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7918_608_605_2_611_700_703_706_721_23<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Do pro lifers consider the ECP ( morning after pill ) a form of abortion? Interestingly enough i was watching a case on Boston Legal where a catholic ER doctor was being prosecuted because ( due to religious beliefs ) he failed to administer any emergency contraception after an unconscious, underage rape victim was admitted. His medical negligence, hindered by his religous beliefs resulted in the unsanctioned pregnancy of a minor. Does any pro-lifer agree with such actions?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>So the Doctor saved a life and now he is being prosecuted? I thought that is what medicine is all about, to save lives. In my home country ( Chile ) where abortion is illegal, the morning after pill is legal. Why? Because we have a socialist government that declared it an anticonceptive not an abortive pill. Of course there were long and well reasoned debates by lawyers and doctors on both side of the abortion divide. ( not like this thread, apart from me, that is LOL ) To make a long story short : it was declared an anticonceptive, although stops an already fertilised egg from implanting in the uterus. The anti-abortion camp said it was an abortion for the egg was already fertilised. The pro-abortion camp said that it couldn    t be established ( no test is required to administer the pill ) so it was only a precaution as it also prevents or delays ovulation. In any case it is legal in Chile and I totally support it. I learnt so much about it following the debates in El Mercurio. I bet all those pro-abortions women in this thread have never had an abortion. A typical case of do as I say... <br><b>S1:2-  </b>He abused his position by behaving in a medically negligent manner to force his beliefs apon an unconscious, unwilling, sexually abused child. Needless to say he was successfully prosecuted and ordered to pay damages. A doctor is bound by the ethics of his profession whilst treating patients, not by his / her own religious beliefs. Amen to that! Or perhaps all the women on this thread are cases of responsible, diligent contraceptive behavior.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>A doctor is bound by her conscience not to perform an abortion if her conscience prohibits it. This is not only the case in the USA, but also in the UK and Canada. I think it is called The Right of Conscience Act. Freedom of conscience policies - medical organizations <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Perhaps, but this wasn't a case of a doctor not performing an abortion this was a case of a doctor not administering the ECP which intern caused an unconscious, violently raped minor to become pregnant. Either way she won her case big time.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>the point is he followed his conscience and that it what matters. the good thing is that at least in Illinois and the UK and Canada, they agree with Antonia that ' murder ' is a personal opinion and if that opinion is based on moral grounds it is legal to act according to one's conscience. makes sense doesn't it? :) <br><b>S1:4-  </b>I hope his conscious is free from guilt knowing he could have prevented a conception that inevitably ended up in abortion. There would have been no fetus to abort had he not been so negligent. In essence his lack of intervention on behalf of an unconscious, sexually assaulted child caused a pregnancy to result when one could have been prevented. He wasn't being expected to abort, he was however expected to prevent conception from occurring as within the treatment guidelines of every admitted rape victim. He willfully ignored this. The defense made him responsible for retribution of personal damages on behalf of the victim due to his negligence including now having to experience an abortion. Plus a multitude of other claims. The doctor created a situation for a procedure he was so against. Ironic. Like i said, they won, it turns out religious morality as a defense for medical negligence wasn't so legal after all. Medicine and its practice is legally free from religious morality. We cant exactly have mormon doctors running around refusing blood transfers can we?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7918_207_197_1_209_212_215_217_220_222_223_13<br><b>S1:1-  </b>Another opinion : Yes. If someone " supports " and " chooses " to stand behind an issue, whatever it may be, then that individual is exhibiting their free will to show that they are IN FAVOR OF, or PRO that position. Simple as that. Your failure to understand this very simple concept is bizarre.<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Just like pro-choice is in favor of choice, not abortion. We don't choose abortion over life, nor life or abortion. We are for the choice and freedom of the person who is actually in the situation rather than the government. So, calling any choicer pro-abortion is inaccurate, however calling any lifer anti-choice is accurate, because they are against choice. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Wrong again, Kemosabe. Because you see, the woman who finds herself pregnant and CHOOSES to carry the baby to term, is making the far more difficult and honorable choice. The woman who CHOOSES to put her baby up for adoption to give it a better life than she can provide, is making the ultimate, unselfish, choice. The woman who CHOOSES abortion is the one choosing the selfish, easy way out.<br><b> S2:2-  </b>In your opinion, and not in all situations. In some situations. In other situations its the dumb choice. In your opinion, because you don't know what its like. You've never been faced with an unwanted pregnancy, and you cannot possibly know every American woman's circumstances when it comes to an unwanted pregnancy, therefore you are in no position to choose for her. And you did not refute my argument at all. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>Shooterandproud : Oh, but I did. This was your argument : Whether you agree or disagree that the choices a pregnant woman who delivers a baby makes are more honorable and less selfish, is irrelevant. You have acknowledged that they are indeed, choices. Therefore, they are not against choice. They CHOOSE to have sex, they CHOOSE to go through with the pregnancy and they CHOOSE to give the baby up for adoption. They CHOOSE life.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>You are anti choice because you are against the choice of the woman to abort or not. And saying that by having sex you are giving permission to let a baby live in your stomach is like saying it is a cyclists fault for being hit by a car, because he chose to step outside and ride his bike. Therefore he deserves no medical attention. <br><b>S1:4-  </b>Shooterandproud : Tell your health teacher he's fired. The baby grows in the mother's uterus, not her stomach. The uterus serves no other purpose in a woman's body than to serve her reproductive cycle. By introducing sperm to the egg that drops into a woman's fallopian tube, the resulting fertilization causes the fertilized embryo to attach itself to the woman's uterus to grow. Don't introduce sperm in there and an egg can't be fertilized.... duh! Btw, pre-natal care is very important for both the baby and the mother, therefore the only reason not to get medical care is ignorance. There are plenty of clinics and Medicaid for those too poor to have their own health insurance. And for all of those spandex bike riders who think they own the gosh darn road riding 3 abreast and not following the rules of the road, they DO deserve to get hit by a car. But hey, I'd call an ambulance for them anyway.<br><b> S2:4-  </b>She. That was a play on words, because when we were all little we thought the baby was in mommy's stomach. You have about a 25 - 35% chance of getting pregnant with unprotected sex. And cyclists are 11 times more likely to be killed on the road than a person in a car. http://www.daclarke.org/AltTrans/BikesDangerous.html Stay home instead of biking, and your chances of dying are dramatically decreased. " Care " being an abortion, because it solves the problem, just like if a biker is hit it'll solve the problem because he probably won't die if he gets care. Considering they're doing a service to you and this country by not emitting so much damn pollution you should be thanking them. I bike everywhere for three reasons : the environment, my health, and laziness so I won't have to get a driver's license. <br><b>S1:5-  </b>Shooterandproud : Relax. Stating a fact is not belittling you. If you were to say to me, " You think like a middle-aged woman ", would that be belittling me? Now, if I were to say, " You think like a retarded child, " THAT would be belittling. But I've said no such thing. Furthermore, stating my argument has failed, doesn't make it so. ;-) And it would become easier and less expensive if more American babies became available instead of being tossed aside as biowaste. Uh, ok. You also ignored my point that many bikers today blatantly ignore the rules of the road, ( have unprotected sex ), ride 3 abreast ( selfishness ) and then sometimes get hit ( knocked up ). It's not a matter of do they get medical care or not. It's a matter of how do they choose to deal with the result of their irresponsible actions? It is " medical care " whether they go for the quick fix ( abortion ) or a longer hospital stay and rehab ( deliver ). But ask yourself this : If the biker can get a quick fix compared with a longer hospital stay, after he's all better, which situation would probably result in him riding 3 abreast again?</p><p><b> KEY:</b>1-7918_485_484__486_510_511_513_2<br><b>S1:1-  </b>You are quite inappropriately named on this forum. Be that as it may, not a single one of the profetallifers here has had the courage to tell the forum : 1. Who will police matters should abortion be outlawed? 2. How they will do so? and 3. The costs in actual tax dollars it will take to do so. All we see is pontification and bloviation about the sacred zygote. How about trying to live in the real world? Adopting one of the children you worked so hard to " save " might be a good first step. My oldest son is adopted, and that is a real world solution. Do you have the courage to take the same step?<br><b> S2:1-  </b>Chester, who has gone by many other names on this forum before being banned, has actually had these and many other questions answered numerous times ( perhaps phrased differently ) but refuses to answer any questions posed to he / her. Nevertheless, I will answer the 3 non-relevant questions just because I wanted to respond to this post to remind everyone that Chester has been banned from these forums several times and should probably be ignored for the most part. Answers : 1. The police 2. The same way they did when abortion was illegal 3. Depends on how many people break the law. Probably similar to when abortion was illegal plus adjustments for inflation. <br><b>S1:2-  </b>Still more generalities do not answer the question. Can you please deal in specifics. After all, this is actions we are discussing that involve both the police power and the taxing power of the government. Hypothetical : If the USA outlaws abortion and Canada does not ( They always were more enlightened than we. ), do you advocate for pregnancy police at the border to check the status of every woman of child bearing age upon leaving and reentering the USA?<br><b> S2:2-  </b>I was specific.... but perhaps you want very specific ideas. I am actually flattered you want to know my specific ideas. I always knew you cared. Ok... my specifics for a poster who never answers anything. 1. Police from local level ( they normally wear a variation of blue uniforms ) and, when needed, certain FBI units similar to the way crimes are investigated today and very similar to the way it was done prior to 1973. 2. They will do so using the same tactics used by the police force in other crimes. This can include wiretaps, informants, people confessing, 911 calls, DNA evidence, the list goes on... perhaps you could watch an episode of CSI and get some ideas! 3. The cost question cannot be anymore specific as it is impossible to measure. What is the cost to police robberies? It depends on how many robberies occur in a given locality. For example if City x has 0 robberies in a year than the cost to that police force is 0. Surely someone as " enlightened " as Canada can figure this out... or maybe not. As for your forth question. I would say we should just outlaw visits to Canada. We don't want to run the risk of overwhelming their fantastic universal health care system. <br><b>S1:3-  </b>If abortion is kept safe and legal, the cost, as well as the Draconian measures you propose, drop away. Is it really worth it to you to intrude in this manner on the most personal decision a woman can make? BTW, citing a report from the far right wing Fraser Institute does not add credibility to what you say.<br><b> S2:3-  </b>Indeed. If you don't do something, you generally don't want to fund it. Is it worth it to you to intrude on my most personal opinion on the matter? The zero reports you cite still leave you with zero credibility. But who's counting</p></body> </html>
