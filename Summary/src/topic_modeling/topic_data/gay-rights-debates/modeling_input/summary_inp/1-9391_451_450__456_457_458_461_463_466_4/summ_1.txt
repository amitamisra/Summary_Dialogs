He claims that because he is forced to accept heterosexual marriages, society should be forced to accept homosexual marriages. He accuses Christian organizations for supporting anti-gay legislation and claims that denying same-sex marriage is unjust, and that preventing same-sex marriage is a method of promoting heterosexual privilege.   argues that heterosexual marriage is the status quo, so it rests on proponents of same-sex marriage to demonstrate that this new definition of marriage is superior to the current definition.
