Two people are discussing gay rights.    states that marriage is a contract between the state and the two people involved and he finds irony that the Christians are opposed to gay religious marriage when the civil part doesn't affect them, but gays can have a religious marriage but not a contract with the state.  He states that someone's marriage is their own business, and just as he is forced to accept heterosexual marriages why shouldn't others accept homosexual marriages.    contends that since everyone lives in the society, its policy is everyones business.   He also states that heterosexual marriages is the status quo, and the challenger to that is the one who has to justify the changes.
