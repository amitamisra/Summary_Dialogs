  believes marriage is a contract between the state and two people. He compares it to forming a corporation. He finds it ironic Christians are against the religious aspects of marriage yet, because they are unable to stop religious marriage they want to stop the contract. He believes he is forced to recognize heterosexual marriage and others should recognize gay marriages. He does not believe rights should be voted on and gives an example of slavery.   does not think anyone is harmed by gay marriage but believes official policies are everyone's business. Heterosexual marriage is the status quo, so it is thus recognized. Any changes to the status quo should be justified. He doesn't see marriage as a right an example being unmarried people.
