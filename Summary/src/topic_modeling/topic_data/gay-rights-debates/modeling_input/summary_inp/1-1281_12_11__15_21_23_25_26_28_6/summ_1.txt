  claims that marriage is defined as a family unit based on a heterosexual contract.   refutes this assertion, citing a number of countries which recognize same-sex marriage and compares the lack of reproductive potential for homosexual couples to a heterosexual couple that chooses not to have children or is unable to have children. He also argues that single parent families are not considered traditional and references a poll showing support for gay rights among the 18 - 29 demographic.   claims that a traditional family is composed of a husband and wife and that the laws of other countries are irrelevant to the laws of America. He argues that single parent families are natural and suggests that time will decide which side is right.
