  thinks that comparing homosexuals to black people is a bad argument because people are born black but gay people make a choice to have gay sex which he considers to be a sin. He thinks if it is not a choice then we should be on guard at shopping malls and street corners. The implication is people could be attacked if is isn't a choice. He views gay sex as a violation of the word of God.   laughs at the idea of homosexuality being a choice and says that he does not have a choice in being attracted to either males or females. He talks about sexual attraction verses the actual sex act. He rejects the idea gay people should be celibate forever.
