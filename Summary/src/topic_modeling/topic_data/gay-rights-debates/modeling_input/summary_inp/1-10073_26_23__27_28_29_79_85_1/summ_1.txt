  claims that the debate over same-sex marriage has nothing to do with marriage equality because allowing homosexuals to marry would require redefining the meaning of marriage which is unacceptable. He argues that marriage is an institution that was created to be a union between a man and a woman with the intention of creating children as part of stable nuclear families. He also suggests that homosexuals are abnormal and are trying to convince themselves that they are normal by changing the law to allow themselves to get married.   claims that redefining marriage might not be a bad idea and claims that preventing a homosexual from marrying the person of their choice is discrimination. He also suggests that  's opinions do not match reality.
