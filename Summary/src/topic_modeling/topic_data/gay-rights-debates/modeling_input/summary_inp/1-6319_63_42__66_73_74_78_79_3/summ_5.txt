Two people are discussing gay marriage.  The discussion revolves around whether or not a clergy person should have the right to refuse to marry a gay couple based on religious beliefs.    believes this is alright to do while   does not agree.    provides an example of his/her managing a restaurant asking if it would be acceptable for him to refuse to serve a boy scout based on the fact they conflict with his/her religious beliefs.  He/she also believes clergy members should not be permitted to refuse a union due to the fact the tax payers pay the salary of such people.    feels forcing this issue is the equivalent to forcing a Jewish person to eat pork sandwiches.
