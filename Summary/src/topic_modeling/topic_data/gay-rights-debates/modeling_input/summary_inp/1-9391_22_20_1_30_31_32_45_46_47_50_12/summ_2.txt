He also states that he can vote using whatever criteria he feels, and though the government can't establish religion or give special consideration to certain groups as a voter he can.    retorts by stating that civil unions are not equivalent to marriages.  He states that the US government does not consider marriage a sacrament and he states   is mixing religion and government.
