  is in favor of civil union laws for gay couples, but has a religious based objection to gay marriage because she deems marriage a sacrament and homosexuality a sin according to the bible.    considers the bible to be a complete work of fiction, and makes the argument that a majority group should not deny a minority group a right when that right does not hurt the majority in any way.  He likens the situation of gay marriages being denied by a majority to the idea of California being able to vote to ban the citizens of Michigan from driving.    says   should devote more time to perfecting civil union laws, and that gay marriage does hurt the majority population financially.
