Two people are discussing the increase in frequency of earthquakes.    contends that the amount of earthquakes in the last century is increasing exponentially.  He contends that there has been 20 large earthquakes in the latter half of this century, compared to about 15 for the first half and about 7 in the entire 19th century.   retorts that the method used to detect and record earthquakes have been taking exponential leaps forward, and he states that   is taking statistics from one source without critical thought an accepting it as fact.    rebuts stating that the new methods detect minimal or localized earthquakes and that major ones can be detected without a seismograph.
