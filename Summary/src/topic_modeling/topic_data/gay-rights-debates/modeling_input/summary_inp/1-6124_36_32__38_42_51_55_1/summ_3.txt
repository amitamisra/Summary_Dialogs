The issue here is whether government or religion should decides the principles of marriage, and who is allowed to get married.
 
 Speaker one believes that leaving it up to religions groups does not satisfy what gays are looking for. They are searching for the civil benefits that come with a marriage and would like to be treated equally in that respect. The speaker believes gay should be able to marry a person of their choice and get equal rights.
 
 Speaker two opinions that there should indeed be a better system for marriage benefits and that it is all "single" people that get screwed over by marriage's current stature. Speaker two believes that gay people should marry a woman if they want the same rights.
