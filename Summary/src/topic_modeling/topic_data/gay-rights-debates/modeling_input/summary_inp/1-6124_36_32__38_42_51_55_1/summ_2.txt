  thinks that the government should stay out of marriage and that it should be left to religious institutions. He thinks there needs to be a better system and that single people are the ones that are harmed the most by marriage laws because they are unable to get any of the benefits that married people do even if they want them, or it is important to their situation.   says religious ceremonies aren't what gay people want because they already can have them via churches. They want the rights and to keep the government out would be to give up those rights. If single people want those rights they should get married, but he thinks you should be free to marry who you wish.
