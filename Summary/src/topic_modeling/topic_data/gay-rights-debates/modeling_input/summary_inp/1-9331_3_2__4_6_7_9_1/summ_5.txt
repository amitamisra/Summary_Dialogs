Two people are discussing the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).   believes that the State Constitutional Amendment banning gay marriage is legal.  He states that the outcome of the courts ruling impacts all taxpayers, and he argues that the court cannot rule a California Constitutional Amendment unconstitutional because Federal Law gives states the right to ignore other state's gay marriage law.    asserts that the state constitution cannot violate the federal constitution, and based on what DOMA does it  violates the 14th amendment.  He also states that gay people pay taxes too and he wonders why gays must pay for straight marriages while not being allowed to marry themselves and that DOMA doesn't prohibit states from recognizing gay marriage.
