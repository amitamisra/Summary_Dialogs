  compares being against gay marriage to the Taliban and Sharia law. He sees no difference in those that oppose gay marriage for religious reasons and have laws against it and Muslims that pass laws based on religion. He finds it hypocritical for people to be against Sharia law when they are, in his opinion, doing the same thing. He believes marriage is a legal contract between two people and the state and he supports gay marriage.   does not agree with the comparison of Sharia law and being against gay marriage. He has not advocated for jail time or the death of homosexuals. They are free to do as they wish. He believes gay marriage pushes that relationship onto others, and he opposes it.
