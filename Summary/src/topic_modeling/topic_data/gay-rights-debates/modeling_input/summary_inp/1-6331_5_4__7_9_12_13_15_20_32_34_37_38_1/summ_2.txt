Two people are discussing gay marriage and its possible consequences.    contends that our current marriage benefit laws are set up for two adults running a household, so recognising group marriages is a huge task. He points out that even though its for one man and wife, that is not a necessity and would be a much easier task than allowing group marriages.  He argues that the purpose of what gays are trying to do is to get married, and a side effect is that people will see it as the scope of marriage being broadened.  But, broadening marriage to include polygamy and other types of marriages is a side effect that doesn't need to be accepted.    contends that cultural and legal precedent is very real, and that intent is irrelevant.  This is because by seeking gay marriage, the boundaries of what defines marriage is widening to include more than opposite-sex couples and because that, gays are broadening marriage, which inevitably leads to broadening in the other areas.
