He thinks gays can marry members of the opposite sex just as heterosexuals do and heterosexuals can't marry members of the same sex. He thinks gay people have the same rights as heterosexuals and does not view marriage as a right. Therefore, slavery and women's rights are bad comparisons.   thinks  's argument is ridiculous and gays lack rights.
