  provides a link to a quiz to see where ones views line up with those of the Supreme Court and the American public. He thinks the problem with the quiz is that it is opinion based.   thinks the Supreme Court should not rule based on their opinions, but rather on their interpretation of the Constitution. Also, he thinks labels such as conservative are incorrect as they express a political view and not judicial interpretation.   dislikes the quiz. He thinks people are making courts a legislative body and if rulings are opinion based Congress should do it as they are voted in. He agrees that the rulings should not be considered liberal or conservative and gives an example of corporations running ad campaigns.
