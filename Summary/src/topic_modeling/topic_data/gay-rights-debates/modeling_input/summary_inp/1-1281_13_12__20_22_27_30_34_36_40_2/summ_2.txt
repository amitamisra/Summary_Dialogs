  views the marriage arrangement as society recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract. He explains that natural means between a man and a woman. He accepts that everyone has their own values but it is unreasonable to expect that all values are socially acceptable. He believes legalizing gay marriage is a form of forcing society to accept gay behavior.
   questions the validity of using the term natural to define marriage. He uses an example of same-sex marriage in a Congo tribe to show that marriage is defined by the needs of the social group. Banning gay marriage is forcing one set of believes onto others. He argues that legalizing gay marriage does not force gay values onto anyone.
