  asks   how equal marriage would hurt someone, her, or anyone else.  s way of equal marriage would not   or her.   is only concerned with gay rights and will talk people out of attending bible churches.   will try to legally disrupt any of the fundraising activities that they have going on, protest their weddings and their services. Once they crossed the line and enacted laws that hurt   and  s family, then they have no place in society. The majority should not have the right to enslave their fellow citizens and send them to concentration camps. She should admit to her bigotry, discrimination and anti-gay views.
  
  
    is glad that   abandoned a silly argument about the violation of the first amendment right, but still does not see why only laws that do not cause harm should be enacted.   is surprised at  s affinity for the harm principle given that   has expressed being at war with evangelical anti-gay christianity.   holds that people should be about to legislate their views, and wants   to explain why that shouldnt be so with anti-gay people. In a democracy like ours people use the democratic process to have views enacted into law. If she is free to do this, then so is  .
