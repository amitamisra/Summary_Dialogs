Two subjects are discussing discrimination against homosexuals in the workplace.    feels there is no comparison between racial discrimination and disapproval of homosexual relationships.    advises it is currently legal to fire someone simply for being gay rather than their ability to complete the job correctly and feels this is discrimination.    feels this is incorrect as discrimination is defined as a hatred or fear of another person or group while disapproval of gay relationships is due to not agreeing with another's behavior.    doesn't feel being gay can be described as a behavior.    feels there is no issue with this practice.    wonders what behavior can be disapproved of if the person does his/her job correctly.
