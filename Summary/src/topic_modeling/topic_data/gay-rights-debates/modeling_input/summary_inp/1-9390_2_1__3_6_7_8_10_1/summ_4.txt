Two people are discussing the difference between homosexuality and racial discrimination.    contends that one is a hatred or fear of another human being, while the other is a disapproval of someone's behavior.  He states that if a homosexual was fired, it would be for incompetence rather than for being gay.    retorts by stating that it is perfectly legal in most places in the U.S. to fire someone simply for being gay, not for incompetence.  He also states that he is currently sitting in his pajamas being gay.  He then questions what behavior that he is exhibiting that warrants disapproval.
