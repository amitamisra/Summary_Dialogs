Two people are arguing gay marriage.    states that resorting to name calling indicates the inability to resort to sound arguments.  He then states that the word bigotry is an ugly word, and its ignorant to automatically write off disagreements as "bigotry".    rebuts by saying that he's calling it bigotry because that's what it is.  He then states that if it were another minority being challenged then it would clearly be bigotry. He states whenever gays are involved a group of people always opposes.    refutes that by saying its all about motivation, if any other minority would try and change traditional marriage, they would be met with the same opposition.
