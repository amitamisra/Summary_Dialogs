  and   are debating whether making gay marriage legal will open opportunities for other "taboos" in our society.   believes that in opening this opportunity for gay marriage, the definition of marriage will change and it will allow other issues like incest and polygamy to become legal.   accuses   of hypocracy. In a sense, they believe gay marriage will have a sort of domino effect for other issues.   is arguing that using these other issues to be evidence for why gay-marriage shouldn't be allowed is not a valid argument. Then   goes on to say that this tactic is used to instill fear to those who do not support those other issues.   understands the other issues, but doesn't see the relationship between those and that of same-sex marriage.   keeps arguing that it shouldnt be different figuring out whether one can approve gay marriage but not incest ince they believe the two to be somewhat related.
