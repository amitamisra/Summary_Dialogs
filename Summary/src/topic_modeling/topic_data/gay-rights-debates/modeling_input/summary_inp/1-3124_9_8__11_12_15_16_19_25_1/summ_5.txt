  does not agree with the comparison of gay rights and gay marriage to African American civil rights. He believes it is an insult to all African Americans. He asks for references of Coretta Scott King and Julian Bond being for gay marriage and is surprised to get them. He then amends his statement from all African Americans to most African Americans. He goes on to wonder what MLK would have had to say on the subject. He considers MLK to have far more credibility than either of the two people referenced.   doesn't agree all African Americans are against gay marriage or that it's an insult and posts two different reference links to both Coretta Scott King and Julian Bond being for gay marriage.
