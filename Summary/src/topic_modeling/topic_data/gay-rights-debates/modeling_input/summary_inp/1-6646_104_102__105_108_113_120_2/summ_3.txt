He continues to state that AIDS spread in the US because of the gay community, and the gay community continually tries to deflect the argument and include Africa in the discussion instead of providing real facts.    argues that bringing up the topic of AIDS is solely as a weapon against gays, and that the location of the AIDS epidemic is irrelevant to the discussion. He then states that Africa is included in order to refute the opposing logic.
