  claims that most Christians are not actively attempting to ban homosexuality and supports this claim by citing the fact that Evangelical Christendom as a whole is rarely ever united on anything, so they could not all be opposed to homosexuality. He proposes that gay lobbyists have crossed the line from counter-attacking to simply attacking Christians.   argues that most Christians do oppose same-sex marriage, civil unions, gay adoption, and anti-discrimination laws. To support this point, he cites the various state constitutional amendments that ban same-sex marriage and civil unions. He also suggests that this opinion on the topic of homosexuality is unique to America, claiming that Evangelical Christians in Spain are not actively opposed to civil unions despite sharing the same religious belief systems.
