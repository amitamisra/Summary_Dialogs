It seems like they are discussing the inconsistency of each other's arguments.   is getting annoyed and seems to just be arguing because they are "venting" while   is saying that the inconsistency is present and making all arguments invalid without proof. Both   and   are for gay rights,   is stating that   isn't being consistent and "admits" to being inconsistent, while   is saying they don't care about the inconsistency because of the point they are trying to get across. They bring up Biden and abortion in ways that dont exactly fit the discussion, but just to show the inconsistency in each others opinions.   is saying they would handle this same situation with Biden the exact same way because   is simply talking about perspective.   believes   is stating that   believes in gay marriage but not gay rights, which seems contradictory to  's point. This argument does not have a set topic.
