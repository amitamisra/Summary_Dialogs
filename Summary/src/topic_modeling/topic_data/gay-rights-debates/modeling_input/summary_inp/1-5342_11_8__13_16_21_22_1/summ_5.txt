  is upset with Matt about making an assertion that Republicans would send gays to concentration camps and about a statement by psychologist Paul Cameron. Instead he should have linked someone in the Republican leadership saying those things. Paul Cameron is a frequent target of gay pride movement for demonization.   says that Paul Cameron is the most frequently quoted expert cited by GOP in all their attempts to limit the rights of gay people.   says the point is that Matt commented that someone who may not even be a republican hates gays, and that republicans hate gays. He says its not about Paul Cameron but about Matts ridiculous comments and that no republican in leadership would call for the extermination of gays.   argues that Paul Camerons research is cited in almost every single attack on gay people in state after state legislature.   says to   that he is making a ridiculous generalization while   replies that he said   is probably right to assume that some people were anti-religion.
