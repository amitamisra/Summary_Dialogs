  suggests that politicians should be stoned in public as punishment for their deviant sexual behaviors. He cites the story of Fred Thompson, a politician who was married at 17 and fathered three children with his first wife. He was then divorced and remarried to a woman younger than his oldest child with whom he fathered two more children. It is unclear why this is relevant. He goes on to claim that Fred Thompson is a member of the Churches of Christ which is a religious cult and that he is not really a Christian.   jokes that if you stone someone in public you might be brought up on drug charges and wonders if people think Fred Thompson is simply pretending to be religious.
