  claims that his opposition to gay marriage is based on the belief that it will hurt more people than it helps, not on bigotry. He suggests that it would hurt people with a traditional view of marriage as between a man and a woman, and that the benefits of marriage can be gained by homosexuals without redefining marriage.
   argues that gay marriage does not hurt anyone, straight or gay, and offending proponents of traditional marriage is not a valid argument against it.
