Two people are discussing Christianity.    contends that there is no eye witness accounts of any resurrection ever recorded, and that everything in the Gospels is hearsay.  He states that not only is there evidence, but scientifically and logically no one can be dead for three days and get up and walk away.  He also states that the burden of proof instead lies with those who believe in the resurrection, and that based on the way Christians life their lives they would ironically end up in the pit also.    states that it is all unfounded conjecture, full of left wing, antichrist dysentery.  He challenges   to find credible arguments that bust the resurrection of Christ.
