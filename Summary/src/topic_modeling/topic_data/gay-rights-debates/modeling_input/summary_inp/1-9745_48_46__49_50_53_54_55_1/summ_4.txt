  believes while homosexuality was considered a crime in earlier times, it is no longer a crime today.    feels  's argument of liberal persecution can't hold water due to the fact that liberal tolerance is what allows for   to worship as he/she chooses and state openly his/her opinions.
 
   believes homosexuality should still be considered a crime and those who participate in it should be punished by law along with those who support them.    also believes liberal tolerance is as a whole, not actually tolerant.  Feeling also people with other views from liberalism are persecuted for non-acceptance publicly.    advises gay marriage was voted on and lost there they live and feels it is mostly based upon religious values.
