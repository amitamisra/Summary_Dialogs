Two people are discussing gay rights.    challenges   to find real scientific evidence, as anything coming from Cameron doesn't apply as he has been kicked out and condemned publicly from the legitimate scientific community.  He also states that homosexuality is not a disease, and that HIV infects anyone; being gay does not put people at a greater risk, promiscuity and IV drug usage do.    gives a hypothetical situation, where a minister of public health has proof that people with a certain lifestyle live shorter and he questions what   will do in that situation.  He also states that granting gays the rights and privileges of marriage affects everyone financially and negatively.
