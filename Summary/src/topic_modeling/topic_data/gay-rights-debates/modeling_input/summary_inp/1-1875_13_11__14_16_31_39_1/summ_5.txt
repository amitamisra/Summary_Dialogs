Two people are discussing marriage benefits.    states that healthcare usually applies to spouses, so in order to get the benefits of any health care provided by a spouses job the requirement is marriage.  Since gays can't get married, they cannot share in each other's health care, and he hopes that gay marriages will be sorted out so he doesn't have to hear them complain about health care. He then uses an example of a straight guy who has a girlfriend who can't get any health care because they're not married, and he asks   if she hould get benefits.     contends that legally if they cohabitate for a prescribed period of time or have children, by common law they can.
