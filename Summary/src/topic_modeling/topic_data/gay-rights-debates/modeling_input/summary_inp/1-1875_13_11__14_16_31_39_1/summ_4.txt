 :1 started his comments by talking about the fact that typically only spouses are eligible for health care and that if it is illegal for gays to marry in VA then of course there would be no health care coverage for them in VA. He then compared this to what happens with the girlfriend of a straight guy who cannot get his healthcare benefits. He then said that he hopes that gay marriage stay out of VA so there will not be trouble and that gay marriage will be outlawed everywhere so that gays will stop complaining about the lack of healthcare. 
   pointed out the fact that the straight guy can marry or have a common law relationship so his girlfriend can get benefits.
