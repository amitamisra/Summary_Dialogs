He goes on to say it works the same way if a straight man has a girlfriend. She can't get healthcare through his job. He hopes gay people upset by VA leave and that gay marriage gets outlawed everywhere so he doesn't have to hear gay people complain anymore.   corrects  's grammar when he types common law.   states that a straight man can marry his girlfriend and she can get healthcare, but gay people are prohibited from getting married.
