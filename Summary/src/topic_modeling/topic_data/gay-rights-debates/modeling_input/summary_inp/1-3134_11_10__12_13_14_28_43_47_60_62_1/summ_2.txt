Two people are discussing gay rights.    compares the behavior of the gay community to Sodom.  He references how in the 80s bath houses in San Francisco were closed down when AIDS first came out; in these bath houses 100 men in a daisy chain performed unprotected sex on one another.    retorts that   is relying on rumors and misinformation, and since he doesn't have proof of the claim he shouldn't make it.  He states that its comments like these that characterizes a homophobic bigot, where the actions of a small group of gays in California are being equated to the behaviors of all gays.
