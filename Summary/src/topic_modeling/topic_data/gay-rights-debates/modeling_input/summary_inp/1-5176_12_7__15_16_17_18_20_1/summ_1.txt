 , a heterosexual, and  , a homosexual, discuss the justness of the legislative process, majority rule, and how the latter affects individuals and the gay community.    describes how the gay community is discriminated against, and posits that because laws regarding homosexuals impact them more directly than the general population, it is unfair to have a majority rule apply.    accuses   of not understanding the legal system and proposes that   find majority to have legislation passed, and not look to the courts to redress the discrimination.    analogizes that process to how slavery was abolished, and also analogizes the alleged oppression to the oppression that may be felt by anti-abortion advocates and child molesters as a result of majority rule.
