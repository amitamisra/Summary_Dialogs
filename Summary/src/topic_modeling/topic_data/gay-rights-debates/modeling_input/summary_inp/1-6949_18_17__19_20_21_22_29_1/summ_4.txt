Two people are discussing gay rights.    states that the world changed when the Mass. legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights.  To him, it means that people are changing against homophobic bigotry and he contends that   hopes that the bigots will overturn equality.    disagrees with this, stating that the court decision for equal rights is not a big change, and he only disagrees because the legislation is an over-intrusion by the government.    rebuts stating that such a position means   favors gay marriage, to which   rebuts by stating that he believes that legislation favoring or banning gay marriage are both over-intrusive into people's lives by the government.
