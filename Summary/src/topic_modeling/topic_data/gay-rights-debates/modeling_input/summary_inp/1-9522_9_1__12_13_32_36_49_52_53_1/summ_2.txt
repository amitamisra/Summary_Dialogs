Two people are discussing gay marriage.    states that people in support of marriage equality is growing, and he contends that equality will soon stand on the side of the majority.    retorts that gays lose every time gay marriage is put to a vote in a ballot, and that gays need a better PR strategy.  He also states that majority of people will support civil unions with the same benefits but not marriage and there will be repercussions due to the efforts to give tax money to federal employee's same sex partners despite the Defense of Marriage Act.  To contradict,   states that so far 5 states have passed gay marriage laws, and that gay people pay their taxes just like everyone else.  He also states that the gay community is not a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people.    rebutts by stating that in those 5 states, gay marriage was not put to a ballot, but forced through the court or legislature.
