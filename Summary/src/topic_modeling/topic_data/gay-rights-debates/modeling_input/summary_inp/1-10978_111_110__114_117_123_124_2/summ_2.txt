Two people are in an argument.    states that   is an unrepentant, racist Sodomite, who would hop on to any gay sex proposal.  He denies that   has a husband and says that they are both living in sin and need to repent of their illicit sexual activity.    retorts by stating that he has a husband with the documents to prove it, as he was married in a mass ceremony witnessed by hundreds in a local MCCR Church.  He states that he doesn't accept gay sex proposals except from his husband, and he's not a Sodomite since he lives in Houston.  He also claims that   needs to repent of his judgements, as that is a sin.
