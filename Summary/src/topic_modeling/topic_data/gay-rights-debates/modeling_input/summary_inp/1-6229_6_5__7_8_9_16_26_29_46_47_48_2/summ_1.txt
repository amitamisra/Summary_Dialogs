This is about gay marriage.   seems to believe that someone is making religion into law by saying marriage should be between a heterosexual couple.   is arguing that  's point is not very valid because   is not understanding that they are not using the persons perspective.   believes that that person is trying to hurt them, while   is saying that the person may not necessarily be that way and that the person may be arguing for what they believe to be greater for society, based on their own perspective.  's religious view of marriage is based on two people's love for each other, while the other person believes its between a man and woman.   says  's argument is empty and that   is not showing how the other person is being hurt by gay marriage.   thinks   is not understanding the overall perspectives and just focusing on their own needs.   states that the person's religion put into law affects peoples ability to marry if they are gay, but that  's religion on marriage put into law would not affect marriage for anyone.
