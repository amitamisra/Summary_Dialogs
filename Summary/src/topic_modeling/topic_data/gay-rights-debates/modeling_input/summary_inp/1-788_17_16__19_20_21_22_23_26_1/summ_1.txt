Two people are discussing gay relationships.    is in favor of these unions while   does not support them.    compares homosexual relationships to those of men who practice multiple marriage contending homosexuals are more committed to fidelity than those who believe in multiple marriage.    begs the question of how anyone can say that a man who believes in and practices multiple marriage does not love all of his wives.    cites a 2003 study advising at that time, 62% of Americans were not in favor of gay unions.    believes the roots are deeper than that particular poll.    feels he has a Constitutional right to be opposed to gay marriage as well as gay people themselves.
