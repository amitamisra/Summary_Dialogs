  believes that gay people are the ones that made AIDS a major health concern in the US and asks for proof to the contrary. He thinks   is simply giving opinions and not facts and when he quotes him   says he is flattered that a quote from him is the best intelligent statement he could come up with. He wishes to debate  .   believes no one knows how AIDS came to the US and states that people using dirty needles, those participating in unsafe sex, and those involved in blood transfusions before they knew how it was spread were the ones that made it a health concern. He quotes   as evidence of his hypocrisy in requesting evidence when he offers none.
