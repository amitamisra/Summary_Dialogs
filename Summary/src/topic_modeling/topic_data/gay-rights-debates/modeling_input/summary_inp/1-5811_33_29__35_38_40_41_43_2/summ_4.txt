  and   are discussing society's attitude toward homosexuality in 1909 in reaction to a court case addressing a 1909 issue.  It is not clear when the opinion was issued, but   suggests that the unanimous opinion of 6 judges implies that a ruling in 1909 against homosexuality was not based on prejudice because the act of homosexuality was viewed more as a crime rather than membership in a group.    asserts that there have always been homosexuals and prejudice against them, citing Oscar Wilde for example.    argues that genetic causes were not considered at the time, that homosexuality was deemed misbehavior, and in the past were repressed enough to not constitute a known community which could be discriminated against.    likens historical discrimination against the gay community to historical discrimination against blacks with slavery and women with misogyny.    differentiates the latter two by arguing that nobody openly supported slavery or misogyny as a good and moral thing, whereas the prosecution of sodomy was considered a routine legal proceeding.
