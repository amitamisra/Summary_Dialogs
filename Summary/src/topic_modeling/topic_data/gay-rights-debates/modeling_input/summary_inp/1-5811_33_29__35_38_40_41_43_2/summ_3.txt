  sides with the court's argument that in 1909 there was no prejudice toward gays as they didn't know what this was at that time and this makes it a moral standpoint, not a prejudice against.    feels   does not have a firm grasp of historical facts due to the points made.    rejects the point of gays having been forced to conform to society and cites that hetero-society did not believe in sodomy and due to this would not support relationships between two males.
 
   compares the treatment of homosexuals in that era with the oppression of the black race and the belief women were a lesser gender.    believes the morality of the era was based on ignorance and prejudice as it is today.   advises the moral system used in that era was prejudice based on ignorance and society is plagued by the same ignorance and non-morals.   also believes gays were not thought of as human.  Free to be gay as long as they weren't openly gay.
