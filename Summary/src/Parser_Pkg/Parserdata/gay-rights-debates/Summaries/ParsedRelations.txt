{Attr_0 S2 claims Attr_0} that marriage is defined as a family unit based on a heterosexual contract .

{Attr_0 S2 asserts Attr_0} that marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract out .

{Attr_0 He argues Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that even {Exp_0_conn_Concession though Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 some European countries allow gay marriage Exp_0_Arg2} , 90 % of the world bans gay marriages Exp_0_Arg1} .

{Attr_0 He argues Attr_0} that the US is not Europe and is unlikely to move in the same direction on legalizing gay .

Two people are discussing gay marriage issues .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 is in favor of gay marriage Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony while Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S2 is against . Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 cites the fact that gay marriage is already allowed in many countries and feels it soon will be in the state of Massachusetts .

S2 feels the US will not pass the laws so easily citing the fact that Hawaii has already banned the practice .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} feels the issue of gay rights is more political . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

He disputes S1 's comparison between gay marriage and polygamy , which he fees could be the next thing allowed should gay marriage become commonplace .

S2 holds to the idea that it will be passed and passed soon .

S1 refutes this assertion , citing a number of countries which recognize same-sex marriage and compares the lack of reproductive potential for homosexual couples to a heterosexual couple that chooses not to have children or is unable to have children .

S1 feels any headway will take many years .

{Attr_0 S1 states Attr_0} that all sex is behavior .

{Attr_0 He points out Attr_0} that it is not just about heterosexual contact in many countries .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 He says Attr_0} there are many married heterosexual couples who either choose not to have children or ca n't Exp_0_Arg1} , {Exp_0_conn_Cause so Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 marriage is not simply about having a family Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He states Attr_0} the US is more similar to Anglo nations and in many of those gay marriage is legal .

{Attr_0 He says Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 something is n't judged as good just Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it is natural Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 thinks Attr_0} marriage is recognizing a family unit based on natural heterosexual contact .

{Attr_0 He says Attr_0} that there are many laws different than the US in other nations .

{Attr_0 He thinks Attr_0} family is a basic unit traditionally consisting of two parents raising children .

Homosexuals , {Attr_0 he believes , Attr_0} are more political .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} argues Attr_0} that single parent families are not considered traditional and references a poll showing support for gay rights among the 18 - 29 demographic . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

Two people are discussing gay marriage and politics .

{Attr_0 S1 states Attr_0} that no one in western society has recognized marriage rights for polygamists , to which S2 rebuts , stating that marriage is recognizing a family unit based on heterosexual contract .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} states Attr_0} that {Exp_1_Arg1 in many anglo countries , it is not for a heterosexual contract , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 in marriage with couples who can not have children , it 's not for a family unit either Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} states Attr_0} that single families is not natural . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 contends that European countries have many laws different than the US , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the world majority views it as about the traditional families . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He states Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that single parent is natural Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 husbands die early and gay rights is more about politics Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 claims Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that a traditional family is composed of a husband and wife Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that the laws of other countries are irrelevant to the laws of America Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He argues Attr_0} that single parent families are natural and suggests that time will decide which side is right .

{Attr_0 S1 asserts Attr_0} that polygamous marriage is not recognized by governments in Western societies and is unlikely to be recognized in future .

S1 points to the trend to legalize gay marriage in western countries such as Netherlands , Belgium , and most of Canada .

He points to high support for gay marriages among the 18-29 year-olds in the US .

{Attr_0 He argues Attr_0} that these show that legalizing gay marriage may happen in the future .

S1 makes the claim that marriage is defined as a family unit based on natural heterosexual contact , and suggests that it is the heterosexual nature of the relationship that is important , not how the children are conceived within the relationship .

He uses an example of same-sex marriage in a Congo tribe to show that marriage is defined by the needs of the social group .

Banning gay marriage is forcing one set of believes onto others .

{Attr_0 He argues Attr_0} that legalizing gay marriage does not force gay values onto anyone .

Two subjects are discussing the issue of gay marriage rights .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 is anti-marriage redefinition Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony while Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S2 is pro-gay marriage . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 feels Attr_0} marriage is classified by a heterosexual contract and {Exp_0_Arg1 is not legal or natural Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it involves couples of the same sex Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 challenges the religious aspects of S1 's belief Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 God is not involved in the ceremonies performed by a judge and not in a church . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} offers information in regard to a tribe in the Congo which required its warriors to marry other warriors as they believed relations with women would soften them . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 advises Attr_0} values are always believed to be correct by the person or group who practices them .

{Attr_0 S2 does n't think Attr_0} morals should be forced .

{Attr_0 He argues Attr_0} that homosexuals are attempting to force their morals on others by legalizing same-sex marriage , claiming that legalizing a behavior is a tacit form of acceptance that will affect society .

{Attr_0 S1 thinks Attr_0} marriage is recognizing a family unit based on natural heterosexual contact .

{Exp_0_conn_Synchrony When Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 questioned about artificial insemination by S2 Exp_0_Arg2} {Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 he replies Attr_0} that it is not the way that the children are created that is important . Exp_0_Arg1}

It is the nature of the relationship .

{Attr_0 He thinks Attr_0} that values are what guide people and everyone thinks theirs are correct .

He believes allowing gay marriage forces values on society by forcing them to accept it .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 questions what God enforces marriage rules Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it is performed by a judge . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He states Attr_0} that there is a Congo tribe {Exp_0_Arg1 in which warriors marry other warriors Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 being with a woman may make them less feared Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He thinks Attr_0} that not allowing gay marriage is discrimination and forcing morals on other people .

Two people are discussing gay marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 states Attr_0} that marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract .

S2 questions the religious basis of a civil ceremony like marriage , {Attr_0 suggesting Attr_0} that the stipulations based on religious reasons would vary depending on the chosen religion .

S2 counters by asking about artificial insemination .

S1 states that it is not about the way children are created but about the nature of the relationship , which remains natural .

{Exp_2_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} questions {Exp_1_Arg1 which god would enforce marriage Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Synchrony when Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 the ceremony is done by a judge Exp_1_Arg2} , Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Conjunction and Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 he states that polygamy is a way for bisexuals to stay under the radar . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_2_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He states Attr_0} that the US has been dealing with polygamy for years , with very few prosecutions .

{Attr_0 S1 contends Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that polygamy would n't count Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it is one man or women married to multiple members of the opposite sex Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} compares homosexuality to polygamy , {Attr_0 claiming Attr_0} that polygamy has been unofficially accepted for years , and argues that maintaining the current same-sex marriage bans should be considered discriminatory . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 views the marriage arrangement as society recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract .

He explains that natural means between a man and a woman .

{Exp_0_Arg1 He accepts that everyone has their own values Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it is unreasonable to expect that all values are socially acceptable . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He believes legalizing Attr_0} gay marriage is a form of forcing society to accept gay behavior .

S2 questions the validity of using the term natural to define marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 claims Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the issue of same-sex marriage is an economic issue Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it would have negative effects on businesses , social security , and the healthcare systems Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He believes Attr_0} that the majority will support less ambiguous laws that ban gay marriage .

{Attr_0 S2 argues Attr_0} that legalizing gay marriage will alleviate the state 's burden on support for the dependent spouse in the case of a break-up .

Without gay marriage , the state has to support the dependent spouse .

{Attr_0 S2 feels Attr_0} that a federal amendment to the US Constitution is unlike over the next few years .

S1 and S2 are discussing the issue of gay marriage and the financial effect it will have on society .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 is against gay marriage due to the effects {Attr_0 he believes passing Attr_0} such a law will have on society Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony while Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S2 is in favor . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 feels allowing Attr_0} gay marriage would cause a dependent class needing more benefits of one kind or another .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 questions why gay citizens who pay into the economic system should {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} not benefit from them . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} provides Attr_0} an analogy based on a marriage break up to support this , {Exp_1_Arg1 advising Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_2_Arg1 {Exp_1_conn_Condition if Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 gay marriage were recognized Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Conjunction and Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 there was a divorce Exp_1_Arg2} Exp_2_Arg2} , the spouse making more money would have to pay alimony instead of the other going to the state . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} gay marriage is about economics .

{Exp_0_Arg1 He compares homosexual partners to roommates Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 and demonstrates that you can not make marriage mean whatever you want by explaining that he is not legally allowed to marry his dog . Exp_0_Arg2}

It would create a new dependent class and be a large new tax on businesses , Social Security , and healthcare .

{Attr_0 He thinks Attr_0} same sex partners living together are roommates .

Roommates are single and should not have marriage benefits .

S1 states he is a Jeffersonian liberal and believes in the Constitution as written and the people 's will .

Most Americans , {Attr_0 he thinks , Attr_0} are against gay marriage .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 states Attr_0} that gay people pay into those same systems and believes they should {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} benefit from them . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He believes Attr_0} there is an economic burden when same sex couples break up without legal recognition of the marriage .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 He states Attr_0} that same sex couples are not single Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they are not the same thing as roommates . Exp_0_Arg2}

Two people are discussing the economics of gay marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 states Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that gay marriage poses a tremendous new tax on the economy Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it would create a new dependent class that does n't presently exist Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He makes it clear that he believes same-sex marriage is wrong and claims that the majority of Americans are {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} against same-sex marriage . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

He compares same-sex marriage to single couple roommates and states {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it is n't in the definition of marriage Exp_0_Arg2} , it is n't marriage Exp_0_Arg1} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_1_Arg2 {Exp_1_Arg1 S2 states Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Cause since Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 gay people pay into the same system Exp_0_Arg2} , they should {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction also Exp_1_conn} benefit from it Exp_0_Arg1} . Exp_1_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 He states that by not allowing gay marriage , Exp_0_Arg1} Attr_0} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 a divorce occurs the state would have to care for the dependent partner , instead of the richer partner as in heterosexual marriages . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} states Attr_0} that a federal marriage amendment to the constitution is a long shot . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 suggests {Exp_0_Arg1 that homosexual partners would not be a burden on the mentioned systems Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they would be paying into the systems as well as receiving benefits from them Exp_0_Arg2} .

He cites the legalization of same-sex marriages in various other countries in Europe and North America .

{Attr_0 S1 asserts Attr_0} that the push for gay marriage is driven by economics .

Gay marriage can bring in new taxes .

S1 describes himself as a Jeffersonian Liberal {Exp_0_Arg1 who believes in the application of the Constitution Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it is written Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He believes Attr_0} that the majority of Americans are against gay marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 claims Attr_0} that the number of earthquakes occurring outside of Israel has increased in the last hundred years , comparing 20 large earthquakes in the latter half of the 20th century to only 15 large earthquakes in the first half of the 20th century , and only 7 large earthquakes in the entire 19th century .

{Attr_0 S1 contends Attr_0} that the amount of earthquakes in the last century is increasing exponentially .

{Attr_0 He contends Attr_0} that there has been 20 large earthquakes in the latter half of this century , compared to about 15 for the first half and about 7 in the entire 19th century .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 retorts that the method used to detect and record earthquakes have been taking exponential leaps forward , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he states that S1 is taking statistics from one source without critical thought an accepting it as fact . Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 rebuts stating {Exp_0_Arg1 that the new methods detect minimal or localized earthquakes Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that major ones can be detected without a seismograph Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 discussed the increase in earthquakes outside of Israel in the last 100 years and said it is `` love waxing cold . ''

{Attr_0 He noted Attr_0} that there have been 20 large earthquakes just in this part of the century that were easy to detect even without a seismograph .

{Attr_0 He said Attr_0} he did other research {Exp_0_Arg1 which showed the same results even Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Concession when Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that was taken into account Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He said Attr_0} that he knows that he differs with S2 as he believes {Exp_0_Arg1 that the majority rules in the United States Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Alternative unless Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it violates the constitution Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 said Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that he felt like shaking something at S2 and Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 asked S1 about the advances in the recording of the earthquakes Exp_0_Arg2} and challenged his source and his statistics .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} challenged S1 's earthquake argument . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 argues Attr_0} that this information is clear evidence that the frequency of earthquakes is increasing over time .

{Attr_0 S1 notes Attr_0} that the number of earthquakes outside Israel has increased I the last one hundred years exponentially .

He or she quotes the lists of `` World 's Mostangerous Earthquakes and Selected Earthquakes in the United States '' from the Citizen 's Guide to Geologic Hazards .

He or she notes about twenty large earthquakes globally in the latter half of the century compared to about fifteen for the first half of this century and only seven large earthquakes recorded in the entire nineteenth century .

{Attr_0 They believe Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the United States Government is ruled by the majority Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous until Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it violates the constitution Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 refutes this by stating that technological advances in earthquake tremor detection has improved greatly since the nineteenth century , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that S1 's argument purposefully excludes this fact . Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 refutes S1 claim of increasing earthquake frequency , {Attr_0 suggesting Attr_0} that the greater number of earthquakes detected could be a matter of increases in our ability to detect earthquakes rather than an actual increase in the number of earthquakes occurring .

S1 takes this point into consideration , but claims that the evidence still supports his original claim .

{Attr_0 S1 argues Attr_0} that the number of earthquakes has been increasing in recent times , citing statistics for larger earthquakes suggesting the frequency of large earthquakes increased five fold from the 19tyh to 20th centuries .

{Exp_0_Arg1 The context of the discussion may be religious Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S1 mentions Israel as well as the U.S. Constitution and rights of minorities versus majority rule . Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 seems exasperated with S1 's comments here and in prior posts and suggests {Exp_0_Arg1 that advances in detection technology and increases in recording practices could explain any seeming increase in the frequency of earthquakes , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that S1 is merely looking at statistics unscientifically to support the assertion Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 is confident she accounted for the variables mentioned by S2 by limiting her argument to large earthquakes .

Two people are discussing the increase in frequency of earthquakes .

{Attr_0 S1 claims Attr_0} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 healthcare is generally extended to spouses Exp_0_Arg2} , homosexuals will not be eligible to receive healthcare through their partner Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 same-sex marriages are not recognized in Virginia Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg2} .

S1 corrects S2 's grammar when he types common law .

{Exp_1_Arg1 S2 states {Exp_0_Arg1 that a straight man can marry his girlfriend Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 she can get healthcare Exp_0_Arg2} , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Contrast but Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 gay people are prohibited from getting married . Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 two people cohabitate for awhile or have children Exp_0_Arg2} they should get healthcare because of Common law Exp_0_Arg1} .

Two subjects are discussing Virginia 's unwillingness to allow gay couples to marry .

S1 is using the basis that the request for legalizing gay marriage is mostly based on the want and need for healthcare benefits one 's spouse in entitled to using the example {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 a gentleman and his girlfriend are not married Exp_0_Arg2} , the girlfriend would not be eligible for healthcare under the boyfriend either Exp_0_Arg1} .

S2 contends this is not a singular subject and is more based on rights as the heterosexual couple S1 uses {Exp_1_Arg1 as an example has the right {Exp_0_Arg1 to get married Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they choose Exp_0_Arg2} , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Contrast while Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 a gay couple does not have the option to make that same choice to Exp_1_Arg2} .

S1 holds hope that gay marriage will be banned everywhere .

{Exp_1_Arg1 S1 :1 started his comments by talking about the fact {Exp_0_Arg1 that typically only spouses are eligible for health care Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that {Exp_1_conn_Condition if Exp_1_conn} it is illegal for gays to marry in VA {Exp_1_conn_Condition then Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 of course Exp_1_Arg2} there would be no health care coverage for them in VA. Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1}

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} compared this to what happens with the girlfriend of a straight guy who can not get his healthcare benefits . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} said Attr_0} that he hopes that {Exp_1_Arg1 gay marriage stay out of VA {Exp_2_Arg1 {Exp_1_conn_Cause so Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 there will not be trouble Exp_1_Arg2} Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Conjunction and Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 that gay marriage will {Exp_3_Arg1 be outlawed everywhere Exp_3_Arg1} {Exp_3_conn_Cause so that Exp_3_conn} {Exp_3_Arg2 gays will stop complaining about the lack of healthcare Exp_1_Arg1} Exp_2_Arg2} Exp_3_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

He likens this situations to a heterosexual male with a girlfriend who would not receive his healthcare benefits .

S2 pointed out the fact {Exp_0_Arg1 that the straight guy can marry or have a common law relationship Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause so Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 his girlfriend can get benefits Exp_0_Arg2} .

Two people are discussing marriage benefits .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 states that healthcare usually applies to spouses Exp_0_Arg1} , {Exp_0_conn_Cause so Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 in order to get the benefits of any health care provided by a spouses job the requirement is marriage Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_conn_Cause Since Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 gays ca n't get married , Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_0_Arg1 they can not share in each other 's health care Exp_0_Arg1} , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 he hopes {Exp_2_Arg1 that gay marriages will be sorted out Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Cause so Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 he does n't have to hear them complain about health care Exp_2_Arg2} . Exp_1_Arg2}

{Exp_2_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} uses an example of a straight guy who has a girlfriend {Exp_1_Arg1 who ca n't get any health care Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 they 're not married Exp_1_Arg2} , Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Conjunction and Exp_2_conn} {Exp_3_Arg1 {Exp_2_Arg2 he asks S2 Exp_3_Arg1} {Exp_3_conn_Condition if Exp_3_conn} {Exp_3_Arg2 she hould get benefits Exp_3_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_2_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 contends Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that legally {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they cohabitate for a prescribed period of time or have children , by common law Exp_0_Arg2} they can Exp_0_Arg1} .

He presents his opinion that homosexuals should move out of Virginia and his hope that same-sex marriages will be made illegal everywhere .

{Attr_0 S2 argues Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the cases presented by S1 are not equivalent Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the heterosexual male has the right {Exp_1_Arg1 to marry his girlfriend Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Condition if Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 he chooses Exp_1_Arg2} , at which point she would be eligible for his benefits Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} points out Attr_0} that {Exp_1_conn_Asynchronous after Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 cohabitating for a certain period of time , Exp_1_Arg2} {Exp_1_Arg1 the woman would be eligible under common law marriage Exp_1_Arg1} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 says Attr_0} that healthcare applies to spouses Exp_0_Arg1} , {Exp_0_conn_Cause so Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_conn_Condition {Exp_0_Arg2 if Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 it is illegal for gay people to get married in VA Exp_1_Arg2} {Exp_1_Arg1 they ca n't share healthcare Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} .

He goes on to say {Exp_0_Arg1 it works the same way Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 a straight man has a girlfriend Exp_0_Arg2} .

She ca n't get healthcare through his job .

{Attr_0 He hopes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 gay people upset by VA leave Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 that gay marriage gets outlawed everywhere Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause so Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 he does n't have to hear gay people complain anymore Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S1 claims Attr_0} that homosexual partners should n't expect shared healthcare in the same way that an unmarried couple should n't .

{Attr_0 He thinks Attr_0} gay people have the same rights as heterosexuals and does not view marriage as a right .

{Exp_0_conn_Cause {Exp_0_Arg1 Therefore Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 , slavery and women 's rights are bad comparisons . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 thinks Attr_0} S1 's argument is ridiculous and gays lack rights .

{Attr_0 He says Attr_0} gay people ca n't marry who they love and compares it to people protesting interracial marriage , slavery , and women 's rights .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 He believes Attr_0} gay people are in the process to overcome Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they will win the right to marry and to have healthcare as well . Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 and S2 are debating gay marriage and healthcare benefits .

S1 is against gay marriage as well as shared healthcare between gay couples .

S2 feels this objection points to S1 's being in support of things such as segregation and prohibition .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 argues Attr_0} that gays do have the right to marry in order to qualify for healthcare , they just have to marry someone of the opposite sex , advising straight people Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 gay people have the same rights due to this . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 contends Attr_0} that due to the fact gay people can not choose to marry someone they love , of the same sex , they do not have the same rights as heterosexuals Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 this is prejudice . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He suggests Attr_0} that homosexuals are not being denied any rights , that they have all the same rights as heterosexuals .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} gay marriage laws will be passed .

{Attr_0 S1 said Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 gays want healthcare Exp_0_Arg2} they can marry someone of the opposite sex just like straight people do Exp_0_Arg1} .

{Attr_0 He said Attr_0} that there never will be a federal law allowing gay marriage in the United States .

{Attr_0 He said that he believes Attr_0} that S2 's is wrong in his assertion that the gay marriage issue is similar to the issues of slavery , women 's right to vote , etc.

{Attr_0 He said Attr_0} that gay marriage is not an unalienable right .

{Attr_0 S2 said Attr_0} that S1 probably liked segregation and was most likely against women voting too .

{Attr_0 He said Attr_0} that gays do not now have the right to marry who they love but eventually will .

He compared the struggle for gay marriage to conquering polio and getting the vote , etc.

Two people are discussing gay marriage rights .

{Attr_0 S1 states Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that gays do n't have the right to shared health care Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they 're not married Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He points out Attr_0} that nobody can marry someone of the same sex , not just homosexuals .

{Attr_0 He states Attr_0} that gays do have the right to marry members of the opposite sex , but not the same sex , which is the same has heterosexuals .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} states Attr_0} that there will never be {Exp_1_Arg1 a federal law allowing gay marriages in the US , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Synchrony as Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 there is allot of backlash going on lately Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 contends Attr_0} that gays do n't have the right to marry who they love , which is what they are fighting for .

{Attr_0 He states Attr_0} that they will win , just as what happened with slavery and women voting , to which S1 states where entirely different issues .

He rejects the idea that homosexuals will succeed in legalizing same-sex marriage , citing several cases where homosexual marriages were banned .

S2 accuses S1 of accepting that some people should not receive the basic right to marry the person they love .

He likens this to slavery , prohibition , and women 's suffrage .

{Attr_0 He claims Attr_0} that the proponents of same-sex marriage will eventually be successful , just as human rights advocates were with slavery , voting , and interracial marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 the two gay people living together should not expect healthcare Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous since Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 straight people that are n't married ca n't get it Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 He thinks Attr_0} gays can marry members of the opposite sex just as heterosexuals do Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 heterosexuals ca n't marry members of the same sex . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 does not believe Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that anyone outside of a heterosexual marriage should be considered a husband , wife or a spouse Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 legally they are not Exp_0_Arg2} .

S2 asks why a homosexual union is not legally recognized .

{Attr_0 He claims Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_1_Arg1 appealing to the traditional definition of marriage is circular reasoning Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_conn_Cause therefore Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg2 insufficient to explain why homosexuals are being discriminated against Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2} .

S1 and S2 are discussing the topic of gay marriage .

S1 feels the term husband is not recognizable in a same sex relationship nor is the term wife .

S2 feels the only reason these terms are not recognized {Exp_0_Arg1 is Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the couple is gay and gay marriage is not yet recognized legally Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 holds that the marriage is viewed legally as one man and one woman , not same sex ; comparing the theory {Exp_0_Arg1 that a cat is not a dog simply Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 one chooses to call it so Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} cites Attr_0} that according to the CBO , 600,000 gay couples would want {Exp_1_Arg1 to wed Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Condition if Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 legislation were passed to allow it Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 wants logical reasons for now allowing gays to marry .

Two people are discussing the legal definition of marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 contends Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that terms such as gay husband , gay wife , and gay spouse are not legally recognized Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they do not meet the legal criteria of one man , one woman Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 This person believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the term gay marriage is an oxymoron Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 marriage , legally , to them , is only between one man and one woman Exp_0_Arg2} .

He compares it to the fact that a cat does n't meet the legal definition of a dog , and questions if we should change the legal definition of a dog just to appease the cat .

{Exp_1_Arg1 S2 contends {Exp_0_Arg1 that they are not legally recognized simply Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they 're gay Exp_0_Arg2} , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 it 's circular reasoning . Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 He states Attr_0} that stating that marriage is heterosexual completely ends any debates , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he questions the logical reasons for marraige discrimination against gays and lesbians . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 agrees Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony when Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 a husband is part of a heterosexual relationship Exp_0_Arg2} a gay husband is not legally recognized in the same category Exp_0_Arg1} .

His statistics support the fact {Exp_0_Arg1 that 60,000 gay couples would get married Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they were allowed Exp_0_Arg2} .

The equal rights are n't there when it comes to same sex marriage .

{Exp_0_Arg1 Welfare is referenced Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony when Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 making a point about political muscle . Exp_0_Arg2}

American freedom never existed and no one ca n't argue that FR 's public opinion on the role on the federal government .

{Attr_0 S2 thinks Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that it is a problem Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 same sex marriage has never been legally recognizes is a big problem Exp_0_Arg2} .

The debate is more for straight couples than it is about gay relationships .

{Attr_0 {Exp_1_Arg1 They believe Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that prior to Roosevelt , society did not accept the idea of state welfare as constitutional , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause {Exp_0_Arg2 because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 people were willing to sacrifice freedom for security Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2} , they eventually caved to his ideas .

{Attr_0 He notes Attr_0} that there are logical reasons for marriage discrimination .

{Attr_0 S2 does not believe Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that marriage is simply between one man and one woman , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 that the entire reason behind the debate is Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause so that Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 homosexual marriage can and will be legally recognized Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2} .

They do not see a reason for discrimination against homosexual marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 claims Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that gay husband , gay wife , and gay spouse are not legally recognized categories Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 homosexual unions do not meet the legal criteria for marriage , namely that it occurs between one man and one woman Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 He claims Attr_0} that Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 of this , many people view the term gay marriage as an oxymoron . Exp_0_Arg2}

He uses the example {Exp_0_Arg1 that a cat can not be called a dog just Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 someone wants to Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He admits , Attr_0} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast however Exp_0_conn} , that there is a possibility that gay unions might eventually be recognized with the same rights as heterosexual unions . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 concedes Attr_0} that there would be little financial impact on support for homosexual marriage , and would Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction in fact Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 supply a surplus . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 responds Attr_0} that he does n't want to impose his morals on others , but believes in defending the Constitution .

Two people are discussing the financial effect of allowing for gay marriage .

S1 originally believed allowing gay marriage would have a negative financial impact on society as a whole .

He has since amended that belief due to information found in the CBO .

His reasoning for still supporting the ban on gay marriage has changed over to moral and health related concerns .

{Exp_0_conn_Concession Although Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S2 is pleased with the concession of S1 's former opinion , Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_0_Arg1 he believes jumping to the moral high ground still ignores other issues . Exp_0_Arg1}

He would like to discuss the positive impact that allowing gay marriage would have on the country practically .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 advises Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony while Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he is a defender of the Constitution Exp_0_Arg2} , he does feel society should decide .

Two people are discussing the benefit to society that same-sex marriage has .

{Attr_0 S1 concedes Attr_0} that same-sex marriage does not have the negative financial impact that he thought it would .

{Exp_0_conn_Contrast {Exp_0_Arg1 However Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 , this person still desires a debate on moral and health concerns of the issue . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

He states his wish to move past fiscal concerns and move ont the the moral and health concerns of same-sex marriage .

{Attr_0 S2 contends Attr_0} that he wishes to discuss the practical benefits .

{Attr_0 He states Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the discussion of `` morality '' is a safe ground Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 morality is relative and subjective Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 retorts by stating that he does not feel the need to impose his morality on anyone ; he is willing to let society determine its own limits .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} states his wish that S2 inform him of the benefits of same-sex marriage . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 apologizes for jumping the gun and misreading the one billion dollar surplus link .

{Attr_0 He\/She admits Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the civil debate issue about gays did n't have such of a a negative financial impact Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they first thought Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} proposes concerns {Exp_1_Arg1 about what the moral and health concerns would be Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Condition if Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 we continue to do this with civility Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 is more flexible with accepting societies standard of behavior and Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_Arg2 is {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} willing to let society as a whole determine what the limit of same sex marriage is . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 was hoping to talk more about the fiscal concerns Exp_1_Arg1} , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg2 he {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction also Exp_1_conn} wants to know how same-sex marriage benefits society in practical ways Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2}

They do not view themselves as someone who imposes their moral beliefs on others , and is willing to let society determine its own limits .

{Attr_0 {Exp_1_Arg2 {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} thinks Attr_0} that same sex marriage does , {Exp_1_conn_Restatement in fact Exp_1_conn} benefit our U.S. Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg2}

{Exp_1_Arg2 {Exp_0_conn_Contrast While Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 they vocally defend the United States Constitution as written Exp_1_Arg1} , Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_0_Arg1 they {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction also Exp_1_conn} desire to be more flexible with public determined acceptance of behavior . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 would like to see this concession as a means to lead to a discussion on the societal benefits of same-sex marriage , {Exp_0_conn_Contrast however Exp_0_conn} , {Attr_0 they believe Attr_0} that S1 is attempting {Exp_1_Arg1 to hide behind their moral grounds Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 S1 sees it as relative and subjective Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 admits Attr_0} that he {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous previously Exp_0_conn} misrepresented a statistics , claiming that a particular study actually predicted a $ 1 billion surplus as a result of legalizing same-sex marriage . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He claims Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Concession although Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 this alleviates his fiscal concerns on the topic Exp_0_Arg2} , he still objects to same-sex marriage on the grounds of moral and health concerns Exp_0_Arg1} .

{Exp_1_Arg2 {Exp_1_Arg1 S2 suggests {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S1 was wrong about the surplus Exp_0_Arg2} he might {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction also Exp_1_conn} be wrong about other aspects of the issue of same-sex marriage Exp_0_Arg1} . Exp_1_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He suggests Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that it would be useful to discuss the ways same-sex marriage could benefit society instead of moving on to a discussion of morality Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous since Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it is relative and subjective Exp_0_Arg2} .

S2 suggests {Exp_0_Arg1 that he would be liberal Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 modern liberalism was actually Jeffersonian , meaning that democracy is viewed as the power of the people Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He believes Attr_0} that liberalism has been hijacked by extremist special interest groups such as the gay lobby .

Theemocratic Party today is favoring special interest groups instead of engaging in honest advocacy for the people .

S2 supports equal opportunity for gay people , but not the redefinition of marriage in the US .

Two subjects are discussing liberalism and its similarities or lack thereof to the Jeffersonian belief system .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 they are nothing alike Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony while Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S1 believes they have many similarities Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 advises Attr_0} Jefferson believed liberty would be threatened by a centralized government .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} advises Attr_0} liberalism is not based on the same theory . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 believes the opposite stating the opinion that the group believes in fairness for all , except the gay community .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 advises he supports equal opportunities for all people despite their sexual preferences Exp_0_Arg1} ; {Exp_0_conn_Contrast however Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 , he does not support the redefinition of marriage to allow for gay unions Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_1_Arg1 S1 feels {Exp_0_Arg1 this is a double standard Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it is basically saying equal rights for all Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Contrast but Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 gays still can not marry . Exp_1_Arg2}

He cites Jefferson 's beliefs {Exp_0_Arg1 that war can be necessary in order to maintain liberty Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that centralized government is a threat Exp_0_Arg2} , and points out how these beliefs are the opposite of modern liberalism .

S1 supports gay marriage and thinks S2 is being hypocritical by saying he agrees with fairness and honest advocacy but excluding gay people from it .

{Attr_0 He implies with sarcasm Attr_0} that S2 thinks marriage is only for heterosexuals that wish to reproduce and only uses religiously approved positions .

S2 wishes modern liberalism were more like Jeffersonian liberalism .

{Exp_0_Arg1 He states decentralization was a big theme for Jefferson Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he would have opposed over-regulation . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He says Attr_0} he agrees with taking care of the elderly , fairness , and freedom .

{Exp_0_conn_Contrast {Exp_0_Arg1 However Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 , he does not support redefining marriage , and thinks modern liberalism has been taken over by special interest groups , such as the gay lobby , in the same way the Republicans were taken over by the religious right in the 1980 's . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

Two people are discussing politics and gay marriage .

{Attr_0 S2 contends Attr_0} that modern liberalism has strayed from what Jefferson believed .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 He states Attr_0} that Jefferson believed that liberty was threatened by a centralized government , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he would have opposed over-regulation . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_conn_Alternative {Exp_0_Arg1 Instead Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 , the liberalism embodied by theemocratic party is opposite in stance , becoming anti-religion , over-regulatory and taken over by extremist interest groups , much like the Republicans were taken over by the religious right . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He further claims Attr_0} that the currentemocratic party is anti-religion , over-regulatory , and controlled by the gay lobby .

{Attr_0 S2 states Attr_0} that he supports equal opportunity for people regardless of sexual behavior , but not the redefinition of marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 contends Attr_0} that S2 is doing the same thing by effectively stating marriage is only for heterosexual people who use sex only for procreation .

{Attr_0 S1 interprets S2 's argument as a claim Attr_0} that fairness should exist for all people except homosexuals .

S2 clarifies {Exp_0_Arg1 that he does support equal opportunity for all people regardless of their sexual behavior , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that he is still opposed to redefining the traditional view of marriage by legalizing same-sex marriage for homosexuals Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 asks S2 to clarify his statement about Jeffersonian liberalism .

{Attr_0 He believes Attr_0} that S2 is hypocritical about supporting Jeffersonian values on `` making sure {Exp_0_Arg1 there is fairness '' and `` honest advocacy '' for the people Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony while Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 opposing gay marriage Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} that the term `` liberalism '' has a different meaning different compared to the time of Thomas Jefferson .

{Attr_0 He said Attr_0} that Jefferson is for decentralization of government which is the opposite stance taken by theemocratic Party .

Prior to this dialog , S2 apparently likened the gay marriage movement to the Civil Rights movement of the African American community .

S2 retorts by saying that Coretta Scott King and Julian Bond are both for gay marriage .

S1 and S2 are calmly discussing gay marriage and the comparison between the gay community and African Americans and their struggle for equal rights .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} it is an insult to all of African American society to compare these two plights .

{Attr_0 S2 provides a website containing information advising Attr_0} Coretta Scott King supports gay marriage equality .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} advises Attr_0} he\/she has given this website example several times in the past . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_1_Arg2 {Exp_1_Arg1 S1 changes {Exp_0_Arg1 his statement of the comparison 's being an insult to all African Americans to some but Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 poses the question of hour Exp_0_Arg2} Reverend Martin Luther King would feel about gay marriage advising his opinion would mean more than either of the examples cited by S2 which {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction also Exp_1_conn} included Jullian Bond . Exp_1_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg2}

S1 does n't want people to compare a race of people 's fight for equal rights to a class of people determined by their sexual orientation .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 She {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} asks for a cite link that says Attr_0} African Americans are for gay marriage . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 claims Attr_0} that S2 ca n't come up with a reference link .

{Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous {Exp_0_Arg1 Then Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 , she turns her question to African Americans and asks how Martin Luther King Junior would have felt about this issue - he has more credibility than all of her examples . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 is offended by the alleged analogy , finding a material distinction between race and sexual orientation .

{Attr_0 S2 argues Attr_0} that Coretta Scott King and Jillian Bond are against gay rights .

She lets S1 know that cite links have been shared many times .

{Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 She {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} shares a couple of links for S1 to see and Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 replies that no one will ever know for sure . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2}

S1 does not agree with the comparison of gay rights and gay marriage to African American civil rights .

{Attr_0 He believes Attr_0} it is an insult to all African Americans .

He asks for references of Coretta Scott King and Julian Bond being for gay marriage and is surprised to get them .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} amends his statement from all African Americans to most African Americans . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

He goes on to wonder what MLK would have had to say on the subject .

He considers MLK to have far more credibility than either of the two people referenced .

S2 does n't agree {Exp_0_Arg1 all African Americans are against gay marriage Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Alternative or Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that it 's an insult and posts two different reference links to both Coretta Scott King and Julian Bond being for gay marriage Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 She suggests Attr_0} that to view it otherwise would be an insult to all African Americans .

{Attr_0 S2 points out Attr_0} that two presumably prominent African American figures , Corretta Scott King and Jullian Bond , are pro-gay marriage .

{Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 questions whether they do {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction in fact Exp_0_conn} support gay marriage , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 S2 provides links to support his assertion . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2}

S1 accepts the evidence and concedes that some African Americans may not be as insulted by the analogy and wonders how Martin Luther King felt about the issue of gay marriage .

Two people are discussing whether or not the civil rights activists are for gay marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 states Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the comparison of a race of people 's fight for equal rights and a class of people determined by their sexual orientation should not be made , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it is an insult to all African Americans Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} wonders how Rev. MLK would feel about the gay rights issue . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 is against gay rights apparently because of the biblical story of Sodom , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the sexual activities S1 perceives to have occurred in San Francisco bath houses , which S1 asserts the current gay community is trying to re-open . Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 and S2 are discussing gay marriage and S2 's opposition to it .

S1 feels remarks made by S2 point more to his being a bigot rather than simply opposing gay marriage .

S2 makes reference to a Yahoo search producing information of gay bath houses operating in San Francisco saying 100 males {Exp_0_Arg1 in these places are practicing unprotected sex on one another Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 this is wrong Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S1 contends Attr_0} the remark pertaining specifically to 100 men shows this information is based more on opinion than fact .

S1 urges S2 to read the article he cited to which S2 responds what is being done in one community to re-open gay bath houses has no bearing on whether or not gay marriages should be permitted .

{Attr_0 S1 thinks Attr_0} a better comparison is Sodom .

{Attr_0 He argues Attr_0} that 100 men in a daisy chain performing unprotected sex on one another would be in comparison to Sodom .

Everyone else should condemn it .

{Exp_0_Arg1 He informs S2 of the bathhouses that can be looked up , they were shut down Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony when Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 AIS first came out and are flourishing once again . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} asks S2 to go to a cite link to see how gays are trying to reopen bath houses in San Francisco . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He argues Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the gay community is going back to unprotected sex Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that a daisy chain of 100 men perform unprotected sex on each other in the bath houses Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 argues Attr_0} that S1 's comments make him a bigot .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} proclaims that he just does n't believe anything that S1 is saying . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_1_Arg1 He determines Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 that S2 is making claims without any proof Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he wants the claims justified or taken back Exp_0_Arg2} , {Exp_1_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_1_conn} calls S1 irresponsible . Exp_1_Arg2}

S1 compares gays to Sodom and justifies it by saying there are bath houses in San Francisco with 100 men performing unprotected sex on each other .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 He Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_Arg2 does n't think Attr_0} it is homophobic , but {Exp_0_conn_Alternative rather Exp_0_conn} , a fact . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 they were closed down Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony when Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 AIS came about but are being opened again Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He states Attr_0} it can be found by Google search .

{Attr_0 S2 thinks Attr_0} this is rumors and misinformation .

{Exp_0_Arg1 He questions Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S1 got the information from Focus on the Family . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 He thinks there is no proof of that Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it 's a homophobic opinion . Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 challenges the assumptions , specifically finding the daisy chain of 100 men a less than credible assertion and admonishes S1 to use facts to support his arguments , not opinions .

He believes one should have proof of any claims they make .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction furthermore Exp_0_conn} believes Attr_0} that the things that went on in the 80 's are not relevant to what today 's society has going on . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} notes Attr_0} that S1 's apparent fascination with bath houses is not relevant to the gay rights topic under which the posts are being entered . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

Two people are discussing gay rights .

S1 compares the behavior of the gay community to Sodom .

He references {Exp_0_Arg1 how in the 80s bath houses in San Francisco were closed down Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony when Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 AIS first came out Exp_0_Arg2} ; in these bath houses 100 men in a daisy chain performed unprotected sex on one another .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 retorts that S1 is relying on rumors and misinformation , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_conn_Cause {Exp_0_Arg2 since Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 he does n't have proof of the claim Exp_1_Arg2} {Exp_1_Arg1 he should n't make it Exp_1_Arg1} . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He states Attr_0} that its comments like these that characterizes a homophobic bigot , where the actions of a small group of gays in California are being equated to the behaviors of all gays .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} that the divorce rate in the United States is blown out of proportion by the rate of very young people who get divorced and states that the percentage of people who have been married over five years drops dramatically .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} rejects the comparison of promiscuity between heterosexuals and homosexuals by pointing out that only heterosexuals are legally allowed to marry . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

Two people are discussing the rate of divorce among heterosexual couples versus that of gay couples .

S1 feels {Exp_0_Arg1 the divorce rate in the United States is severely overestimated Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony while Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S2 adheres to the statistics that show heterosexual marriages end in divorce almost 50 % of the time and of those divorces Exp_0_Arg2} , most are in the first five years .

S1 feels the numbers are warped due to the large number of young couples {Exp_0_Arg1 who get married and Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 decide it was a mistake and get divorced Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S1 feels Attr_0} gay people are more promiscuous than heterosexuals .

{Attr_0 S2 provides several cites several websites which show Attr_0} most divorces of hetero couples are due to adultery .

S1 refuses to view the articles calling them propoganda .

Two people are discussing the divorce rate in the US .

{Attr_0 S1 contends Attr_0} that the high divorce rate is due to the high rate of young people who get divorced .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 He states Attr_0} that the rate of people who get divorced who have been married over five years drops dramatially , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he states that statistics prove {Exp_1_Arg1 that gays in general are much more promiscuous Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 straight people Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 They {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} believe Attr_0} that homosexuals are more promiscuous than heterosexuals . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 retorts by stating {Exp_0_Arg1 that young people and young marriage are not the same , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that couples in general who divorce do so more often in the first five years , regardless of age Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} states Attr_0} that the heterosexual divorce rate is 50 % , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 heterosexuals are not better at {Exp_2_Arg1 staying Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_Arg2 together {Exp_2_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_2_conn} people expect homosexuals to Exp_2_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 thinks Attr_0} that the divorce rate among the young in the U.S. is actually dropping instead of rising , despite what everyone thinks or says .

{Attr_0 He admits Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that young people get divorced Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they eventually realize that they made a mistake Exp_0_Arg2} .

Gays are all promiscuous which lead to high divorce rates , plus you ca n't compare gay couple relationships with straight relationships .

The debate is ceased by stating that no one can actually know what percentage of the population of the U.S. is gay .

S2 disagrees with the statements made and gives links to info which is related to .

{Attr_0 The GUEST thinks Attr_0} that heterosexual marriages end in divorce nearly fifth percent of the time and thinks straight couples are no better at staying together than gays are .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that young people and young marriages are n't really the same thing , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that the real facts are that those who divorce do so more often within the first five years of marriage , regardless of age Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 They refute S1 's argument by pointing out Attr_0} that heterosexual marriages still end in divorce around 50 % of the time .

{Attr_0 They do n't believe Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that homosexual relationships should compare to heterosexual marriages Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 only heterosexuals are legally allowed to marry Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 suggests that statistics on divorce rates are skewed by the high proportion of young people who end up getting divorces .

{Attr_0 He claims Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the divorce rate drops significantly Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 you focus only on couples who have been marriage more than five years Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} claims Attr_0} that statistics show {Exp_1_Arg1 that homosexuals are more promiscuous than heterosexuals Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 that this would lead to a higher divorce rate for same-sex marriages Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 argues Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the age of the spouses is irrelevant Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that more than half of all heterosexual marriages end in divorce and suggests that it would likely be no difference for same-sex marriages Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S1 does not believe Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that most Christians are trying to ban homosexual unions , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that those accusing them of doing so are doing so falsely Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} suggests that this opinion on the topic of homosexuality is unique to America , claiming that Evangelical Christians in Spain are not actively opposed to civil unions despite sharing the same religious belief systems . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

Two people are discussing gay marriage .

{Attr_0 S2 feels Attr_0} Christians are trying to , in a sense , ban gay people by banning all activities pertaining to gays such as marriage , civil unions , and gay adoption .

S1 feels {Exp_0_Arg1 this is not the case Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that most Christians do n't treat gay people in this fashion Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} feels {Exp_1_Arg1 the issue at hand is not being discussed Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Synchrony as Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 the forum began with speaking about the gay pride industry Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 supports his theory by citing the constitutional amendment to ban both gay marriage and same sex civil unions .

{Attr_0 He feels Attr_0} this is the Christian equivalent of banning gay people by oppressing their lifestyle .

S1 feels this is a weak argument which gay lobbyists have overused .

Two people are discussing whether or not Christians want to ban gay people .

S1 contends that most Christians are not trying to ban the decriminalization of same-sex , it was just an accusation made .

{Attr_0 They believe Attr_0} that homosexual lobbyists have gone beyond being defensive and are actively attempting to attack evangelical Christiandom falsely in order to justify their arguments .

{Attr_0 He contends Attr_0} that evangelicals are rarely united for anything , let alone banning gay people .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} states Attr_0} that gay lobbyists have long stepped over the line of simply counter-attacking with their defense . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 retorts by stating that a majority of self-identified Christians in the U.S. oppose civil marriage for gay people , among other things such as civil unions , gay adoptions and anti-discrimination laws .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 He states Attr_0} that in Spain , they do n't do that , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he points out a state constitutional amendment trying to prevent same-sex marriage . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 thinks Attr_0} that most Christians in this country oppose civil marriages for gay rights .

Evangelical Christians have been opposed and do speak out against gay marriage .

They go on to announce that a state constitutional amendment is being passed to preclude same sex marriage and civil unions .

That means that same sex couples will be seen in the same light as straight couples .

S1 defends the Christians by stating that they do not try to discriminate on gay marriages , {Attr_0 and says Attr_0} that they are n't trying to ban gay marriage .

{Attr_0 the GUEST thinks Attr_0} it is laughable to think that they are that united in one particular event or fight together for good .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 believes Attr_0} that the majority of self-identified Christians in the United States {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction in fact Exp_0_conn} , do oppose civil unions for homosexual citizens . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 They think Attr_0} that the GUEST has blown the whole conversation out of proportion .

{Exp_0_conn_Contrast {Exp_0_Arg1 However Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 , {Attr_0 they point out Attr_0} that {Exp_1_Arg1 in other countries such as Spain , they might not , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Contrast but Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 in general , the belief is the same globally Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

They refute S1 's claims that they are not trying to ban homosexual unions by pointing out that the state constitutional amendments being passed are intended to preclude same-sex marriage and civil unions .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 claims that most Christians are not actively attempting to ban homosexuality and supports this claim by citing the fact that Evangelical Christendom as a whole is rarely ever united on anything Exp_0_Arg1} , {Exp_0_conn_Cause so Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they could not all be opposed to homosexuality Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He proposes Attr_0} that gay lobbyists have crossed the line from counter-attacking to simply attacking Christians .

{Attr_0 S2 argues Attr_0} that most Christians do oppose same-sex marriage , civil unions , gay adoption , and anti-discrimination laws .

To support this point , he cites the various state constitutional amendments that ban same-sex marriage and civil unions .

S1 and S2 are debating whether making gay marriage legal will open opportunities for other `` taboos '' in our society .

S1 is for gay marriage , and opens the discussion by showing logical fallacies used by the opposition to deter people from believing gay marriage is an extension of equal rights .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} that modern families are not traditional families and are often better off for it .

S1 specifically points out the comparison of gay marriage to incest or polygamy .

{Attr_0 S1 says Attr_0} this is a scare tactic to turn people away .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that homosexuality , incest , and polygamy are all related Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they are all taboos of society Exp_0_Arg2} .

S2 wants to draw the line {Exp_0_Arg1 as is Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause so Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the definition of marriage does not change Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_conn_Condition If Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg1 it Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_Arg2 does change Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_0_conn_Condition then Exp_0_conn} there would be no limit to who could marry .

{Attr_0 S1 explains Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that love is present in all marriage Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause so Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the claims made by S2 about gay marriage leading to incest , could be used for straight marriage as well Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_1_Arg2 {Exp_1_Arg1 S2 attacks S1 and thinks Attr_0} that {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg1 the other parties mentioned went and Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_Arg2 paraded their lifestyle Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_0_conn_Condition then Exp_0_conn} they would {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction also Exp_1_conn} have an equal opportunity to make their marriage a social issue . Exp_1_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg2}

-LRB- S1 -RRB- begins talking about how we benefit from {Exp_0_Arg1 what is considered common , such as a nuclear family Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 how it is composed Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that in opening this opportunity for gay marriage , the definition of marriage will change Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it will allow other issues like incest and polygamy to become legal Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_1_Arg2 {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} says Attr_0} that it 's right it has nothing to do with the bible {Exp_1_conn_Contrast however Exp_1_conn} ; it has everything to do with slippery slop logical fallacy . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg2}

{Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous {Exp_0_Arg1 Then Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 , gives the example of how incest and polygamy is less socially accepted in comparison to gay marriage . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_conn_Conjunction {Exp_0_Arg1 And Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 so , it rebuttals {Exp_1_Arg1 the argument using both issues with equal weight {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 it scares some people away Exp_1_Arg2} who might not have much knowledge about the topics Exp_1_Arg1} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 -LRB- S2 -RRB- states Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that a married couple is considered a nuclear family Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that marriage is a legal institution Exp_0_Arg2} .

-LRB- S2 -RRB- poses the question of weather {Exp_0_Arg1 it 's acceptable for gay marriage to be accepted but not the other {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they are less popular Exp_0_Arg2} and Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Condition if Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 so why ? Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 -LRB- S1 -RRB- answers Attr_0} that those issues do not relate specifically to gay legal marriage and that many attempt to use those issues similarly to argue against gay marriage .

-LRB- S2 -RRB- brings up the question of what is socially accepted and the types of taboo relationship and legality .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 -LRB- S1 -RRB- Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_Arg2 says Attr_0} that love is not exceptionally for gay people but {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} others . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_conn_Conjunction {Exp_0_Arg1 Also Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that taboos are constructed on the basis of peoples reasoning , indications and practices . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

-LRB- S2 -RRB- keeps arguing why is anestrous taboo and not gay marriage ?

S2 accuses S1 of hypocracy .

{Attr_0 S1 thinks Attr_0} that we do n't just benefit from what is often considered the common , nuclear family .

We benefit from families with adopted children , step children , families with no children at all .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} that marriage has nothing to do with the bible .

{Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous {Exp_0_Arg1 Then Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 what may lead to incest and polygamy does n't relate specifically to gay legal marriage at all . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 is trying to show that people who are against gay marriage try to dissuade others by attempting to incite fear by spouting off a parade of horribles that have nothing to do with the issue of gay marriage .

S1 holds {Exp_0_Arg1 that love applies to straight marriages as well as gay marriages Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that love is not exclusive to gay marriages Exp_0_Arg2} .

It is fallacious to believe that love will lead to a slippery slope .

Those against gay marriage use logical fallacies .

S2 does not see the logic in bringing up sibling marriages and is curious to know how S1 would respond to such movements .

{Attr_0 S2 does not believe Attr_0} that what people do in their private lives is anyone else 's business .

In a sense , {Attr_0 they believe Attr_0} gay marriage will have a sort of domino effect for other issues .

{Exp_0_Arg1 What may lead to incestuous marriage is Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 siblings or related people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . Exp_0_Arg2}

What may lead to polygamous marriage is 3 or more people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage .

Gay marriage was considered just as much a taboo as incest or polygamy just a few years ago .

S2 does not understand why it is ok to deny incestuous relations the right to marry on the grounds that it is considered taboo , but ok to approve gay marriage on the same grounds .

S1 says we benefit from families with adopted children , step children , or families with no children at all .

Marriage has nothing to do with the bible and everything to do with the slippery slope logical fallacy .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 believes a married couple Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the head of a home is considered a nuclear family Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 is already that the question of legality Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 He questions S1 Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he is trying {Exp_1_Arg1 to say Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 gay marriage is less acceptable than incestuous relations that it is okay to grant gay marriage but not sibling marriage Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 According to S1 , Attr_0} incest and polygamy does n't relate specifically to gay legal marriage .

S2 questions to what exactly does the social acceptance of any type of `` taboo '' relationship have to do with their right to be legally married .

S1 is arguing that using these other issues to be evidence for why gay-marriage should n't be allowed is not a valid argument .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} that gay marriage will change the definition of marriage from `` a legal union between man and woman '' to `` a legal union between any parties that love each other '' .

He poses the question if it is okay for two people to tie the knot then how could incest be taboo .

{Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous {Exp_0_Arg1 Then Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S1 goes on to say that this tactic is used to instill fear to those who do not support those other issues . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 understands the other issues , but does n't see the relationship between those and that of same-sex marriage .

{Attr_0 S2 keeps arguing Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that it shouldnt be different figuring out whether one can approve gay marriage but not incest Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous since Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they believe the two to be somewhat related Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 and S2 discuss same-sex marriage .

S1 , a heterosexual , and S2 , a homosexual , discuss the justness of the legislative process , majority rule , and how the latter affects individuals and the gay community .

{Attr_0 {Exp_1_Arg1 S2 thinks Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that S1 does n't understand Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he is heterosexual Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} not Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_Arg2 the one being oppressed . Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} that the courts should look at individuals lives and the effect of laws on everyone .

He thinks if a law is unjust then it should be overturned regardless of what the majority wants .

{Attr_0 He thinks Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 conservatives are heartless and do n't care Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 people suffer Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 Speaker one is a heterosexual who believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that in our democratic society , the majority rules , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that this majority has so far consistently ruled again gay rights Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 Speaker one believes Attr_0} that courts should not overturn decisions based off the minority complaining and should abide by the majority , how our constitution and government was designed .

{Attr_0 Speaker two believes Attr_0} that the majority is oppressing the LGBT community and being treated as second-class citizens .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 The speaker believes Attr_0} that {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} a law effects an individuals ' life in an unjust way Exp_0_Arg1} , {Exp_0_conn_Condition then Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it is courts responsibility to overrule it for the individual 's sake Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 Speaker two believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 society is oppressing people , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 that {Exp_1_conn_Condition if Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 a law adversely effects even one person Exp_1_Arg2} , it is unjust Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} .

Two people are discussing gay marriage laws .

S2 describes how the gay community is discriminated against , and posits {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 laws regarding homosexuals impact them more directly than the general population Exp_0_Arg2} , it is unfair to have a majority rule apply Exp_0_Arg1} .

{Attr_0 S1 contends Attr_0} that the current system the most votes win , to which S2 contends that the laws should be decided based on looking at the individuals that are affected .

{Exp_1_Arg1 S1 states {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 one wants to change the law Exp_0_Arg2} , he must get a majority of people to do it Exp_0_Arg1} , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 the majority should not be ignored because someone objects to them . Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 states Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the courts should look at the individual lives that will be affected and decide , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that laws that a majority favors that are unjust in an individuals life must be overruled Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 rebuts that that goes against how the courts were designed to work .

Two subjects are discussing a law banning gay marriage .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 the law is unjust Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it segregates the gay community from that of the heterosexual community Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 supports the nation 's ability to vote on such issues and supports the `` majority rules '' philosophy .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} the courts should take individuals ' into consideration and rule on each instead of as a whole .

S1 contends this idea to be incorrect citing the fact {Exp_0_Arg1 that those who believe abortion should be illegal are technically the minority Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that a court would not rule on that issue individually Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 feels S2 and others like him\/her support society 's oppression of certain groups .

S1 accuses S2 of not understanding the legal system and proposes that S2 find majority to have legislation passed , and not look to the courts to redress the discrimination .

{Attr_0 S1 disagrees advising Attr_0} he\/she wants only a society free to vote on laws .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 analogizes that process to how slavery was abolished , and Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 analogizes the alleged oppression to the oppression that may be felt by anti-abortion advocates and child molesters as a result of majority rule . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} that the majority rules no matter what the minority thinks .

{Attr_0 He thinks Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 this is the way the law works Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that it does n't matter how an individual feels Exp_0_Arg2} .

It matters what the majority votes on .

He cites slavery as an example .

{Exp_0_conn_Condition If Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 someone wants Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_0_Arg1 a law changed S1 thinks they should get the majority to side with them and change it . Exp_0_Arg1}

S1 and S2 are discussing the issue of marriage equality .

There continues to be the dual nature of marriage with the courts having to decide about it legally .

Now the religions have {Exp_0_Arg1 to interpret it Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they will Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 He closed with , '' Gay rights is a real test of our constitutional system , {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} , so far , {Exp_0_Arg2 we 're not passing with flying colors Exp_0_Arg2} . '' Exp_0_Arg1}

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 questioned Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_2_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 they found {Exp_1_Arg1 that it violated their State constitutions alone Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Alternative or Exp_1_conn} Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Condition {Exp_1_Arg2 if Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 it was the violation of the Federal Constitution that mattered in these cases Exp_1_Arg2} Exp_2_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2}

Many state constitutions guarantee rights that are n't in the federal constitution .

{Attr_0 S1 states Attr_0} that the majority of the supreme court cases which have addressed a ban on same-sex marriage have deemed the laws unconstitutional .

He recognized the difficulty imposed by the fact that marriage is both a legal contract and a religious ceremony .

{Attr_0 He claims Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Concession although Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the cited cases involved state constitutions Exp_0_Arg2} , the ruling were based on provisions very similar to the federal constitution Exp_0_Arg1} .

{Attr_0 S2 argues Attr_0} that supreme court decisions regarding violations of state constitutions are irrelevant to the federal constitution .

{Attr_0 He claims Attr_0} that the Massachusetts ruling was based on a provision prohibiting discrimination based on sexual preference {Exp_0_Arg1 which is not found in the federal constitution , but Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous later Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 admits {Exp_1_Arg1 that he was in error Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_List and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 that it was based on prohibiting discrimination based on sex Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2} .

Both subjects seem to be on the fence with the issue .

Two people are discussing gay marriage and the Ccnstitution .

{Attr_0 S1 contends Attr_0} that eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue has ruled banning same-sex marriage unconstitutional , based on their state constitutions that closely parallel the federal one .

{Attr_0 He states Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the nature of marriage is both legal and religious , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that the courts only deal with the legal aspect Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 states Attr_0} that the Massachusetts ruling was based on a specific provision in their constitution that prohibits discrimination based on sexual discrimination , which is not founded in the federal constitution , to which S1 states the ruling was on the equal protection grounds .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} states Attr_0} that many state constitutions guarantee rights that are n't in the federal constitution . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 believes marriage to be both a legal contract as well as a religious ceremony and thinks the government and society is stuck in this duality .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 He thinks Attr_0} the courts must deal with this Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 different religions may do as they wish . Exp_0_Arg2}

Winning argument from states that declared banning gay marriage unconstitutional , {Attr_0 he says , Attr_0} are based on state constitutional provisions that closely follow the federal constitution .

{Attr_0 He thinks Attr_0} gay rights are a real test of the constitutional system .

{Attr_0 S2 thinks Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that violating a state constitution has nothing to do with the federal one Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that many state constitutions give rights , such as prohibiting discrimination against gays , that the federal one does not grant Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S1 cites Attr_0} that eight of nine supreme courts have contended same sex marriage to be unconstitutional .

{Attr_0 He thinks Attr_0} it should always be clear which constitution is being discussed .

S2 questions how gay marriage would violate someone 's constitutional rights .

{Attr_0 S1 advises Attr_0} the bulk of the arguments were based on state constitutions which mirror the federal constitution .

S2 uses the example of Massachusetts ' allowing gay marriage under its state constitutional law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation .

{Attr_0 S1 contends Attr_0} there is no such piece to the Massachusetts constitution .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} concedes {Exp_1_Arg1 he was incorrect about the citing Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 the law actually banned only discrimination based on gender and not sexual orientation Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 stated Attr_0} that eight out of nine state supreme courts have found {Exp_0_Arg1 that disallowing same sex marriage is unconstitutional Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 these states had constitutions which are similar to the U.S. Constitution Exp_0_Arg2} .

This seems to be an argument about gay rights and generalizing the political beliefs of people .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 believes Attr_0} {Exp_1_Arg1 that Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause since Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 Republican Party members often use Cameron as citation for research and Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause therefore Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 most share his views that gays are bad for the world and must be exterminated , like the Jews in the Holocaust Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 thinks Attr_0} S2 is making a generalization on the entire party 's based off one person {Attr_1 . Attr_1}

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 thinks this unfair Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 Cameron is not apart of the Republican Leadership , and that the views of Cameron are outdated with the views of Republicans today . Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 compares this to quoting singer John Lennon against religion and attributing it to the entireemocratic Party .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 responds by connecting Cameron with George W. Bush , and believes that {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} a party constantly uses the research of single person Exp_0_Arg1} , {Exp_0_conn_Condition then Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they must share the beliefs of that person Exp_0_Arg2} {Attr_0 . Attr_0}

-LRB- S1 -RRB- starts talking about how it 's ridiculous to think that republicans would send gays to concentration camps like the Germans practiced in the Holocaust .

He talks about Paul Cameron a psychologist having nothing to do with politician 's ideas or decisions .

{Attr_0 He tries to assert Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that republicans do not cite or reference Paul Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he is not a reliable source Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_conn_Contrast {Exp_0_Arg1 However Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 , {Attr_0 -LRB- S2 -RRB- argues Attr_0} that Paul is frequently referenced as an expert on the issue of gay marriage and rights . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

He talks about the moral behind Paul 's `` research '' and how it 's fraudulent .

{Attr_0 According to S1 , Attr_0} S2 talks about Paul Cameron and makes it seem as if he is the voice of the Republicans .

{Exp_0_Arg1 -LRB- S1 -RRB- {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} asks {Exp_0_Arg2 -LRB- S2 -RRB- Exp_0_Arg2} to stay on point and not divert the conversation . Exp_0_Arg1}

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} states Attr_0} {Exp_1_Arg1 that someone who may not be republican may hate gays Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 that Republicans platform or party leadership does not has to do with Paul 's views Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 -LRB- S2 -RRB- says Attr_0} that Paul 's `` research '' is present in the debate over gay marriage .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 -LRB- S2 -RRB- {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} says Attr_0} that Paul has been cited in virtually every legal brief filed opposing gay marriage . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 -LRB- S1 -RRB- says Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that -LRB- S2 -RRB- is generalizing Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony while Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 -LRB- S2 -RRB- talks about family values Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} that there 's a big difference between possibility and likelihood .

S1 finds fault with the stance that republicans would ship gay people to concentration camps .

S1 objects to bringing up a statement by Paul Cameron , as if Paul Cameron has anything to do whatsoever with Republican politics or leadership .

Matt is pulling some wild point out of his hat , {Exp_0_Arg1 saying that Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 someone who may not even be a republican hates gays , that republicans hate gays Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 I might as well have said Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Cause since Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 John Lennon attacked religion Exp_0_Arg2} , thenemocrats hate religion Exp_0_Arg1} .

{Attr_0 S1 argues Attr_0} that it is not the case and one person who sides with a specific party does n't represent the party .

{Exp_0_Arg1 It 's about Matt 's ridiculous generalizations and comments Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S1 holds that there is NO republican in leadership that would call for the extermination of gays . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} that S2 is making ridiculous generalizations .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} that S1 is defending Paul Cameron and states that he is the single most frequently quoted '' expert '' cited by the GOP in ALL their attempts to limit the rights of gay people .

Paul Cameron 's research is cited in virtually every single attack on gay people in state after state after state legislature .

It was presented in the '' debate '' about same-sex marriage in the U.S. friggin ' Senate .

His name appears in the citations of virtually every legal brief filed by opponents of same-sex marriage .

S2 is surprised that reasonable people talk about Paul Cameron .

{Attr_0 S2 finds Attr_0} it laughable to try to defend the GOP when one of their admittedly most effective propaganda campaigns is to rally the '' family-values '' crowd against gay rights .

S1 is upset with Matt about making an assertion that Republicans would send gays to concentration camps and about a statement by psychologist Paul Cameron .

{Exp_0_conn_Alternative {Exp_0_Arg1 Instead Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he should have linked someone in the Republican leadership saying those things . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 uses John Lennon as an example of this not being a proper way to generalize political views of parties , in his case theemocratic party .

Paul Cameron is a frequent target of gay pride movement for demonization .

{Attr_0 S2 says Attr_0} that Paul Cameron is the most frequently quoted `` expert '' cited by GOP in all their attempts to limit the rights of gay people .

{Attr_0 S1 says Attr_0} the point is that Matt commented {Exp_0_Arg1 that someone who may not even be a republican hates gays , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that republicans hate gays Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He says Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 it 's not about Paul Cameron but about Matt 's ridiculous comments Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that no republican in leadership would call for the extermination of gays Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 argues Attr_0} that Paul Cameron 's research is cited in almost every single attack on gay people in state after state legislature .

{Attr_0 S1 says to S2 Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that he is making a ridiculous generalization Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony while Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S2 replies that he said S1 is probably right to assume that some people were anti-religion Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 accuses S2 of making an assertion including the Republicans creating another Holocaust , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 of the generalization that S2 made . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that Paul Cameron 's views are cited and used in many cases against gay rights Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 most people do share the same views , which S1 thinks otherwise Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 says Attr_0} that most attacks on gay rights have cited Paul Cameron , even within the US Senate , showing that he has a strong opinion in the Republican party , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Alternative or Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 at least it seems so . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 and S2 enter a discussion about gay rights , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 more specifically on the claims made by a certain Republican Party member : Paul Cameron . Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 is angered that S2 is making wide generalization about the Republican Party , and agrees that Cameron is eccentric party member .

{Attr_0 S1 argues Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that most people in the country might identify as Christian Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that questioning a study is a very appropriate response to one that vilifies a group of people Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 defends the unmentioned study by suggesting Attr_0} that S1 is unaware of the particular details of the study which could invalidate his argument .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} suggests {Exp_1_Arg1 that S1 dismissed the results of the study without trying to understand them , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_2_Arg1 {Exp_1_Arg2 that the study was in fact well done Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Conjunction and Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 any objections should be based on evidence Exp_1_Arg2} Exp_2_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 is uncomfortable with the study Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 there is n't information on how they got the results . Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 goes on to say {Exp_0_Arg1 the study vilifies a group of people , namely Christians , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that most people in the country may identify as Christian Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} thinks the divorce rate of Christians has no bearing on the issue of gay marriage . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 thinks Attr_0} S1 should ask questions about the study rather than just assume {Exp_0_Arg1 it is incorrect Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that it is n't being used to vilify anyone Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 thinks the results are professional Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S1 is just uncomfortable with the results . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 thinks Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 the divorce rate of Christians is very important to the issue Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 Christians say they are protecting the `` sanctity '' of marriage Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 feels much more clarification is needed as to {Exp_0_Arg1 how the study was conducted Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 who conducted it Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} feels forums such as this one spend too much time attempting to make Christians look bad . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 They believe Attr_0} that there is a lot of attention given to trying to make Christianity look bad through generalization , irrelevant studies and misinterpretations .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} feels that divorce rates among Christians has nothing to do with the issue of gay marriage . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 accuses S2 of being a reactionist .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} S1 is bringing up random , factless arguments without factual information arguing the study seems to be well and professionally done .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} feels that the issues are being dismissed by S1 instead of being met by providing a valid argument . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 believes citing Attr_0} the protection of the sanctity of marriage makes the study 's arguments relevant by supporting their arguments .

Two people are discussing the validity of a gay marriage study .

{Attr_0 S1 states Attr_0} that a problem with the study is that most people in the country identifies as Christian .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 states Attr_0} that Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause since Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the specifics are unknown , questioning them would just be making up objections without factual evidence . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 states that questioning a study is appropriate , especially Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it vilifies a group of people . Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 contradicts , stating that the study was done professionally , stating that no one is vilifying anyone .

{Attr_0 They believe Attr_0} the divorce rate of Christians has no bearing on the gay marriage amendment .

{Attr_0 S1 states Attr_0} that the divorce rate of Christians has nothing to do with gay marriage , to which S2 states {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as long as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they 're trying to protect marriage by keeping gays out Exp_0_Arg2} , it 's relevant Exp_0_Arg1} .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} that S1 is making up objections and deciding without any factual evidence .

{Attr_0 He or she believes Attr_0} that objections should not be hypothetical , but actual proven ones .

{Attr_0 This person thinks Attr_0} that dismissing results , rather than checking validity is reactionary .

This person thinks {Exp_0_Arg1 it is relevant Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as long as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 people say they are protecting the sanctity of marriage Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 claims that the problem with an unmentioned study is that the majority of people identify as Christian Exp_1_Arg1} , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg2 he {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction also Exp_1_conn} recognizes S2 's argument that more details of the study would be helpful to determine whether this is actually a problem Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} claims {Exp_1_Arg1 that the forum tends to make Christianity look bad , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 points out that the divorce rate of Christians is irrelevant to the gay marriage amendment Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 : {Exp_0_Arg1 In 1909 , being homosexual was morally wrong , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 people could be prejudiced about something that they did not recognize as innate Exp_0_Arg2} .

Men who `` acted gay '' were punished for it in 1909 .

Two people are discussing a the perception of homosexuality in 1909 .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 makes the argument that in 1909 , homosexuality was viewed from a moral standpoint instead of being about prejudice and bigotry , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause since Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they did n't realize that homosexuality was a state of being and thought it was purely behavioral . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 contends that it was once moral to have racial and gender inequality based on prejudice Exp_0_Arg1} , {Exp_0_conn_Cause so Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 prejudice against gays was around even then Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 retorts by stating that there 's little historical backing to the idea that racism or misogyny was doing good , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the issue in 1909 was understood behaviorally and Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause therefore Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 morally . Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He states Attr_0} that 1909 society had to little understanding of homosexuality to be prejudiced .

To contradict , S2 states that people hatefully used the term `` Sodomite '' to refer to gays , were put in prison and kept out of everything in Society .

S1 rebuts by stating {Exp_0_Arg1 that it is Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 Sodomy was n't approved , not Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 they were gay , as there was no social identity Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2} .

S1 sides with the court 's argument {Exp_0_Arg1 that in 1909 there was no prejudice toward gays Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they did n't know what this was at that time and this Exp_0_Arg2} makes it a moral standpoint , not a prejudice against .

{Attr_0 S1 feels Attr_0} S2 does not have a firm grasp of historical facts due to the points made .

{Exp_0_Arg1 There was little historical evidence to prove that people in 1909 believed that it was `` right '' or `` good '' to oppress black people or women , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 this sentiment extend to homosexuals . Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 rejects the point of gays having been forced to conform to society and cites that hetero-society did not believe in sodomy and due to this would not support relationships between two males .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 compares the treatment of homosexuals in that era with the oppression of the black race Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the belief women were a lesser gender . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 the morality of the era was based on ignorance and prejudice Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it is today Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 advises Attr_0} the moral system used in that era was prejudice based on ignorance and society is plagued by the same ignorance and non-morals .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} believes Attr_0} gays were not thought of as human . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

Free to {Exp_0_Arg1 be gay Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as long as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they were n't openly gay Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 and S2 are discussing society 's attitude toward homosexuality in 1909 in reaction to a court case addressing a 1909 issue .

{Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg1 It is not clear Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony when Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the opinion was issued Exp_0_Arg2} , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Contrast but Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 S2 suggests that the unanimous opinion of 6 judges implies {Exp_2_Arg1 that a ruling in 1909 against homosexuality was not based on prejudice Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Cause because Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 the act of homosexuality was viewed more as a crime rather than membership in a group Exp_2_Arg2} . Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 asserts Attr_0} that there have always been homosexuals and prejudice against them , citing Oscar Wilde for example .

{Attr_0 S2 argues Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that genetic causes were not considered at the time , that homosexuality was deemed misbehavior , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 in the past were repressed enough to not constitute a known community which could be discriminated against Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg1 In 1909 , {Exp_2_Arg1 people knew that gay sex occurred Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they understood its occurrence to be entirely behavioral Exp_0_Arg2} , {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_2_conn_Cause therefore Exp_2_conn} , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_2_Arg2 {Exp_1_Arg2 immoral Exp_2_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg2}

S1 likens historical discrimination against the gay community to historical discrimination against blacks with slavery and women with misogyny .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 differentiates the latter two by arguing that nobody openly supported slavery or misogyny as a good and moral thing Exp_0_Arg1} , {Exp_0_conn_Contrast whereas Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the prosecution of sodomy was considered a routine legal proceeding Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that in 1909 , the stance against homosexuality was based on a moral obligation and not prejudice Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 homosexuality at that time was viewed as behavioral and not genetic Exp_0_Arg2} .

This person parallels the treatment of women and blacks during that time period and state that it was viewed , back then , as morally right .

{Attr_0 They argue Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Cause since Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 most people viewed homosexuality as a behavior and not a state of being in 1909 Exp_0_Arg2} , it could n't have been prejudiced Exp_0_Arg1} .

This person does not believe {Exp_0_Arg1 that there was a social identity among homosexuals in 1909 Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 society viewed it as morally wrong Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 argues against the idea Attr_0} that ignorance is a reasonable excuse for prejudice .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 This person {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} uses the parallel of treatment of blacks and women , {Attr_0 but argues Attr_0} that morality was an excuse to hide the prejudice . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 They argue Attr_0} that ignorance is what led to a distinct prejudice towards certain lifestyles and people , and argues against the idea {Exp_0_Arg1 that there was n't a social identity for homosexuals in 1909 Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony when Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 there was obvious disapproval aimed in their direction Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 Homosexuality was not understood as a social identity back then Exp_0_Arg1} , {Exp_0_conn_Cause so Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 there was no `` gay lifestyle '' to be prejudiced against Exp_0_Arg2} .

Sodomy was criminalized , not being gay .

S2 : There was prejudice against gays in 1909 just as there is now .

The immorality of homosexuality in 1909 is based on ignorance .

{Exp_0_conn_Synchrony As long as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 gay people `` lived straight '' , Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_0_Arg1 they could be as sexually non-normative as they wanted to be . Exp_0_Arg1}

{Exp_0_Arg1 There were terms for gay men back then , like sodomite and molly , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause so Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 there was a clear identity for people to be prejudiced against . Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 : Religion is a good tool to guide one 's own actions , but not for telling others how to live .

{Exp_0_conn_Synchrony When Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 people claim religion in morals , Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_0_Arg1 they abandon that moral system . Exp_0_Arg1}

It is religious belief - not prejudice - that makes one take an anti-gay stance .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 The Bible says Attr_0} that homosexuality is wrong Exp_0_Arg1} , {Exp_0_conn_Cause so Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 if you believe in the Bible as your moral canon , then you believe that homosexuality is wrong as well Exp_0_Arg2} .

Two people are discussing gay marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the anti-gay agenda is based on prejudice , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that simply calling something moral or religious does not mean it ca n't be prejudice at the same time Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He contends Attr_0} that people who justify the anti-gay agenda claim a moral or religious stance without having one .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} states Attr_0} that he has never seen someone justify an anti-gay agenda based solely on morals or religion . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_1_Arg1 S2 retorts by stating {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony when Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 people claim religion in doing prejudice Exp_0_Arg2} they are actually abandoning their morals Exp_0_Arg1} , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 prejudice is not what 's behind people 's opposition to gays being in romantic relationships . Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He states Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the simple reason is Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it 's Biblical Exp_0_Arg2} ; the Bible says {Exp_1_Arg1 it should n't be done Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause so Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 it should n't be done Exp_1_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_2_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} points out Attr_0} that {Exp_1_conn_Condition if Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 that Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_Arg2 is someone 's belief Exp_1_Arg2} {Exp_1_conn_Condition then Exp_1_conn} that 's fine , Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Contrast but Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 banning someone else from doing it due to that belief is imposing their views on others , which is wrong . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_2_Arg2}

People have been prejudiced against homosexuals for a long time .

S1 believes it is prejudice as opposed to religious or moral beliefs which fuel the anti-gay agenda ; {Exp_0_Arg1 advising a moral-bases system does not allow for the intentional targeting of another Exp_0_Arg1} and {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 religion could be cited but is not based upon dictating how another should live Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 believes all religious based arguments regarding gay issues eventually circle around to prejudice and invites S2 to support the religious argument without this happening .

{Attr_0 S1 advises Attr_0} there is no issue with people who do not try to push their views on others .

{Attr_0 S2 concedes Attr_0} religion is not to blame in and of itself and eludes to the point {Exp_0_Arg1 that often times people who are claiming a religious or moral reason for their actions are doing so Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous after Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 having gone against the premise on which their belief is based Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} advises Attr_0} {Exp_1_Arg1 he\/she is against same sex relationships Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 the Bible says it 's wrong but does not impose his\/her beliefs on others and is not prejudice Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 refuses to give the summary of their religious argument .

S1 and S2 are discussing anti-gay bias and the nature of prejudice versus valid religious beliefs .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} it is prejudicial {Exp_0_Arg1 to hold anti-gay opinions , whether based on religious values or {Exp_0_conn_Alternative otherwise Exp_0_conn} , and Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_Arg2 use them to impose ones views on another Exp_0_Arg2} .

S2 agrees that religious belief can be improperly used as the pretext for acts of prejudice against the gay community , but proposes that only people who are lying about having religious values against homosexuality should be accused of being prejudiced .

S2 asserts vaguely that her belief that `` Christ is a resurrected being '' somehow absolves her of prejudice in being generally opposed to homosexuality .

Moral or religious prejudice is still prejudice .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 seems inclined to grant her leeway based on such a religious objection , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 requests more specifics as to why a Christian must oppose homosexuality and admonishes S1 not to actively agitate against the gay community or advocate for public policies which are discriminatory . Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 is opposed to groups such as `` Focus on the Family '' -LRB- may be a misnomer -RRB- who attempt to impose their views on others .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that people can be prejudiced without having a true religious or moral reasoning behind it , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that sometimes those that do are claiming that they do falsely Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 This person believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that anti-homosexual sentiments are based on prejudice Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that those who oppose homosexual lifestyles use religion and morals as an excuse to say that they are n't actually prejudiced Exp_0_Arg2} .

This person voices a displeasure in those {Exp_0_Arg1 who would press their own personal biases upon others , especially Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony when Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 using morals or religion as reasons for doing so Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} that people can have a strong moral or religious belief and not be prejudiced .

This person does not approve of a homosexual lifestyle and argues that it is not because of prejudice but because of his or her personal religious beliefs .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He or she , {Exp_0_conn_Contrast however Exp_0_conn} , {Attr_0 states Attr_0} that they have no desire to impose such beliefs on anyone else . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 This person believes Attr_0} that what they personally believe is not what everyone else does , and agrees that people can falsely claim a moral or religious opposition to homosexual lifestyles .

A person can claim a moral or religious stance without having one .

You can not justify an anti-gay agenda on morals or religion .

An anti-gay stance on the grounds of religious belief is prejudice .

{Attr_0 Prejudice based on religious belief implies Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that a religious person 's acts of prejudice could have a negative impact on homosexuals , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they believe that being gay is morally reprehensible Exp_0_Arg2} .

S2 : Prejudice is a fact of human existence .

Christianity is a moral system .

S1 and S2 discuss the civil benefits of marriage and how they could or could not be extended to single people and gay people .

{Attr_0 Speaker one believes Attr_0} that leaving it up to religions groups does not satisfy what gays are looking for .

They are searching for the civil benefits that come with a marriage and would like to be treated equally in that respect .

{Attr_0 The speaker believes Attr_0} gay should be able to marry a person of their choice and get equal rights .

Speaker two opinions {Exp_0_Arg1 that there should indeed be a better system for marriage benefits Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that it is all `` single '' people that get Exp_0_Arg2} screwed over by marriage 's current stature .

{Attr_0 Speaker two believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that gay people should marry a woman Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they want the same rights Exp_0_Arg2} .

Two people are discussing the right to marry .

{Attr_0 S1 states Attr_0} that marriage should be left to a religious institution where it would mean something .

S2 states that it is not the ceremonies that gays are looking for , it is all the civil benefits .

S1 retorts that there should be a better system , that even allows single people with best friends access to the same benefits .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 retorts saying that gays are not single people , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 single people can always get married . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_2_Arg2 {Exp_2_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 is initially against government being involved in the equation , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_conn_Asynchronous {Exp_0_Arg2 after Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 S2 describes many of the legal rights and benefits associated with marriage , such as automatic inheritance and hospital visitation rights , Exp_1_Arg2} {Exp_1_Arg1 S1 is {Exp_2_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_2_conn} able to relate to the issues by considering the case of his life-long bachelor uncle , suggesting that it is single people who are discriminated against by being excluded from the marriage benefits Exp_1_Arg1} . Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_2_Arg1} Exp_2_Arg2}

S1 contradicts by saying that gay people should just marry the opposite sex , to which S2 states that gay people are seeking the right to marry a person of their choosing , not to just marry anyone for benefits .

Two subjects are discussing gay marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 marriage should not be handled by state or legislature but Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Alternative instead Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 be dealt with on a religious level Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} the religious aspect is not what gay couples are trying to be a part of .

{Attr_0 He\/she feels Attr_0} gay couples are more interested in the rights and benefits heterosexual couples are afforded such as insurance and in cases where the relationships dissolve , custody and visitation .

{Attr_0 S1 contends Attr_0} he\/she feels not there should be a ban on gay marriage but a better system to handle the types of situations which S1 describes .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} each person should be free to marry whoever he\/she chooses as despite the reasoning for the marriage , it is commitment .

S2 suggests {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 a single person desires the benefits of marriage Exp_0_Arg2} , they should marry Exp_0_Arg1} , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Contrast but Exp_1_conn} {Exp_2_Arg1 {Exp_1_Arg2 that they should be able to marry a person of either gender Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Synchrony as Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 they see fit Exp_1_Arg2} Exp_2_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S1 thinks Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the government should stay out of marriage Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that it should be left to religious institutions Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_3_Arg1 He thinks {Exp_0_Arg1 there needs to be a better system Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 that single people are the ones that are harmed the most by marriage laws Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 they are unable to get any of the benefits {Exp_2_Arg1 that married people do even Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Condition if Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 they want them Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2} Exp_2_Arg2} , Exp_3_Arg1} {Exp_3_conn_Alternative or Exp_3_conn} {Exp_3_Arg2 it is important to their situation . Exp_3_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 says Attr_0} religious ceremonies are n't {Exp_0_Arg1 what gay people want Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they already can have them via churches Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 They want the rights Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 to keep the government out would be to give up those rights . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_conn_Condition If Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 single people want those rights Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_0_Arg1 they should get married Exp_0_Arg1} , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Contrast but Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 he thinks you should be free to marry who you wish . Exp_1_Arg2}

The issue here is {Exp_0_Arg1 whether government or religion should decides the principles of marriage , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 who is allowed to get married Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 and S2 are talking about howemocracy is based on majority rule and whether or not its fair .

S2 attacks S1 by {Exp_0_Arg1 calling their argument `` silly '' Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it violates the First amendment rights Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 remarks Attr_0} that S1 is only concerned with the rights of gay and the anti-gay Christianity .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 specifically names a woman {Exp_0_conn_Instantiation in particular Exp_0_conn} to admit her discrimination . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 expresses that the rights of gays is their first concern and protection from church .

S1 threatens to respond with similar actions against the church , like protesting ceremonial events and church services .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 urges S1 to allow the democratic process to decide the issue , believing the anti-gay movement may {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} have legitimacy . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 questions the majority rule ideology because of incidents in the past like slavery and concentration camps. , and once again calls out the women .

S2 ends by stating those would not be possible today because of the 13th amendment .

-LRB- S1 -RRB- states how can gay marriage hurt politicians or anyone else ?

{Attr_0 -LRB- S2 -RRB- says Attr_0} that there are laws that hurt all kinds of peoples and argues about violation of the First Amendment by imposing someone 's belief over another .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 believes it is completely unfair that gay marriage be dismissed or disliked Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 S2 argues Attr_0} that no matter what S1 believes is right or wrong , the majority of people control what is normal in our society . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 -LRB- S1 -RRB- argues Attr_0} that he is only concern with gay peoples rights {Attr_1 and says Attr_1} that the politician wants gays to remain as second-class citizens .

Argues that politician\/she is discriminating and protecting her heterosexual privilege .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} argues Attr_0} that not accepting gay marriage is punishment to him , his family and others . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 -LRB- S2 -RRB- He argues about the kind of democracy in {Exp_0_Arg1 where majority of the people decide what best for society Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 how Attr_0} being anti-gay is a right of the First Amendment Exp_0_Arg2} .

Is a gay person is allowed to have the freedom , so does he who and others who may not agree .

{Exp_0_Arg1 -LRB- S1 -RRB- {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} gives the example that not just because majority rules it means Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_Arg2 that it 's a good thing . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_conn_Instantiation {Exp_0_Arg1 For example Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 , enslaving people was accepted in previous societies . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg1 -LRB- S2 -RRB- argues Attr_0} that Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Concession although Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 previous societies had legal rights to enslave people Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Contrast but Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 that does n't mean {Exp_2_Arg1 that it makes those decisions all the time Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Conjunction and Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 that is like gay marriage Exp_2_Arg2} . Exp_1_Arg2}

S1 asks S2 how equal marriage would hurt someone , `` her '' , or anyone else .

S1 's way of equal marriage would not S1 or her .

{Exp_0_Arg1 That {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S1 is only towards the rights of gay people Exp_0_Arg2} it is completely understandable for this lady to be in belief that marriage as is is fine . Exp_0_Arg1}

S1 is only concerned with gay rights and will talk people out of attending bible churches .

S1 will try to legally disrupt any of the fundraising activities that they have going on , protest their weddings and their services .

{Exp_1_Arg2 {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous Once Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 they crossed the line and enacted laws that hurt S1 and S1 's family Exp_1_Arg1} , Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_1_conn_Asynchronous {Exp_0_Arg1 then Exp_1_conn} they have no place in society . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg2}

The majority should not have the right to enslave their fellow citizens and send them to concentration camps .

She should admit to her bigotry , discrimination and anti-gay views .

S2 is glad that S1 abandoned a silly argument about the violation of the first amendment right , but still does not see why only laws that do not cause harm should be enacted .

S2 is surprised at S1 's affinity for the harm principle given that S1 has expressed being at war with evangelical anti-gay christianity .

S2 holds that people should be about to legislate their views , and wants S1 to explain why that should n't be so with anti-gay people .

In a democracy like ours people use the democratic process to have views enacted into law .

{Exp_0_conn_Condition If Exp_0_conn} she is free to do this , {Exp_0_conn_Condition {Exp_0_Arg1 then Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 so Exp_0_Arg2} is S1 .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that S1 's argument is not a legitimate viewpoint Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S1 has no justification that this lady hates gays Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 questions to how equal marriages hurts the woman or any other heterosexual .

The only person that gets hurt is S1 .

{Exp_0_conn_Condition If Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg1 equal marriage is Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_Arg2 incorporated into the law Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_0_conn_Condition then Exp_0_conn} nobody gets hurt .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 talks about what if a proposed law hurt someone Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that there are all kinds of laws that hurt all kinds of people . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 says Attr_0} he is only concerned with the rights of gay people .

He calls the woman evil and that she should admit that she is anti-gay and wants to protect her heterosexual privilege .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} that S1 just cares about gay people but has not shown why anti-gay people should not be able to legislate their view .

{Attr_0 S2 says Attr_0} that S1 and the woman both have their own opinions .

S1 asks whether the majority should have the right to enslave their fellow citizens or lock people up in concentration camps .

{Attr_0 S2 responds saying Attr_0} the majority did have the right {Exp_0_Arg1 to enslave fellow citizens Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous until Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the 13th amendment took place and says Exp_0_Arg2} that the majority wins in the united states .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 this lady is not in favor of gay marriage Exp_0_Arg2} , the lady is anti-gay Exp_0_Arg1} .

S1 is taking an aggressive approach by saying {Exp_0_Arg1 they will talk to bible churches and disrupt them Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 she feels like she has no place in society Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 thinks Attr_0} that the majority of people is enslaving their people by not allowing gay rights , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Attr_1 {Exp_0_Arg2 S2 argues Attr_1} {Exp_1_Arg1 that it happens that way Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 it changes over time Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 does not believe Attr_0} S2 has answered her question of how equal marriage hurts any heterosexual .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 the point has been made Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 different laws affect different people Exp_0_Arg2} .

This is about gay marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} that her religious freedom is being persecuted from people against gay marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} this will result in her family not having legal protection .

{Attr_0 S2 does n't believe Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that S1 's religious freedom is being persecuted Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 she is still bale to hold religious ceremonies Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} the same argument can be made fro m her perspective .

S1 's believe of marriage is that it should be based on love and not on sex .

{Attr_0 S2 argues Attr_0} that the religious freedom argument could be used in any format to justify any action .

S1 is angered {Exp_0_Arg1 that the religious freedom of another person will go into law and bar her from marriage Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause so Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 she can sustain her heterosexual privilege Exp_0_Arg2} .

S2 disagrees and thinks `` she '' is doing what she thinks is before society .

S1 and S2 seem to get annoyed with each other by the end of dialog .

{Attr_0 -LRB- S1 -RRB- says Attr_0} that his religious freedom is being ignored by a politician attempting to make her religious beliefs law .

{Attr_0 S1 seems to believe Attr_0} that someone is making religion into law by saying marriage should be between a heterosexual couple .

{Exp_0_Arg1 This law limits legal protection of gay couples Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it is not use to protect marriage but heterosexual privilege . Exp_0_Arg2}

-LRB- S2 -RRB- questions how the politicians view is imposing on -LRB- S1 -RRB- religious freedom .

{Attr_0 -LRB- S1 -RRB- responds Attr_0} that he believes that marriage should be between two people who love each other and not her\/politicians belief that marriage should be between man and woman .

{Exp_0_conn_Contrast {Exp_0_Arg1 However Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 , {Attr_0 -LRB- S2 -RRB- says Attr_0} {Exp_1_Arg1 that the argument surrounding religious freedom is an empty argument Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 anyone can argue for his or her beliefs using religion Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 -LRB- S1 -RRB- says Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that gay marriage does n't violate her\/politicians rights of heterosexual privilege , entitlement Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous since Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 she is not protecting marriage but her beliefs Exp_0_Arg2} .

-LRB- S2 -RRB- questions how -LRB- S1 -RRB- religious rights are taken away or harmed .

-LRB- S1 -RRB- and -LRB- S2 -RRB- discuss about whose religious belief is better for society .

{Exp_0_Arg1 -LRB- S1 -RRB- responds that the her\/politicians interest is not part of his interests Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 or society 's and does not hurts him in any way . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 says Attr_0} that someone , `` her '' , is trying to put their religious beliefs into law that goes against the religious beliefs of S1 .

The law would bar the family of S1 from legal protections but would not affect her .

S2 is arguing {Exp_0_Arg1 that S1 's point is not very valid Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S1 is not understanding that they are not using the persons perspective Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 believes Attr_0} that she is n't protecting marriage Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 preserving her heterosexual privilege . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 Her religious belief is that marriage should be between a man and a woman Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 S1 believes Attr_0} that marriage should be between two people in a loving relationship regardless of sex . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_3_Arg1 {Exp_0_conn_Condition If Exp_0_conn} {Exp_2_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 she put her religious belief into law {Exp_1_Arg1 it would hurt S1 Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Contrast but Exp_1_conn} Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Condition {Exp_1_Arg2 if Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 the religious views of S1 are put into law Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2} Exp_2_Arg2} {Exp_0_Arg1 she would still be able to choose who she wanted Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_3_Arg1} {Exp_3_conn_Conjunction and Exp_3_conn} {Exp_3_Arg2 S1 would be able to choose whomever . Exp_3_Arg2}

She is trying to keep gay people out of marriage .

S2 understands the perspective of S1 but does not think it is a valid argument .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 holds that either Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 either religious belief were put into law that it would infringe on the other 's beliefs . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 claims Attr_0} that S1 has not shown how the religious beliefs would be taken away from such a law .

{Exp_0_Arg1 It can be argued in other ways Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the idea of not giving gays marriage benefits is imposing on religious freedom is an empty argument . Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 counters S1 by saying that it is impossible to know whether or not she is trying to turn religious belief into law .

It is impossible to know or to police someone 's real motives .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 believes Attr_0} {Exp_1_Arg1 that that person is trying to hurt them , {Exp_0_conn_Contrast while Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S2 is saying that the person may not necessarily be that way Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 that the person may be arguing for what they believe to be greater for society , based on their own perspective Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1}

S1 is talking about a female who is ignoring S1 's religious freedom and barring his family from legal protections .

S2 questions to how she is impeding S1 from his religious freedom and argues that she is n't trying to take away his right from a religious ceremony .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 says Attr_0} the woman 's religious belief is that marriage should be between a man and a woman , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S1 's religious belief is that marriage can be between any two people that love each other regardless of their gender . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_conn_Condition If Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the woman 's religious belief gets incorporated in to the law , Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 will not be able to marry the person of his choice Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Contrast but Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 she will still be able to marry regardless of the law . Exp_1_Arg2}

The woman is just trying to keep gay people out of marriage to preserve her heterosexual privilege .

{Attr_0 S2 argues Attr_0} that either one of them can be impeding on the others religious freedom .

S1 does not give in and keeps arguing that she is trying to turn her religious belief into law and bar him from getting married .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 's religious view of marriage is based on two people 's love for each other , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast while Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the other person believes its between a man and woman . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 says Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 's argument is empty Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that S1 is not showing how the other person is being hurt by gay marriage Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 thinks Attr_0} S1 is not understanding the overall perspectives and just focusing on their own needs .

S1 states that the person 's religion put into law affects {Exp_0_Arg1 peoples ability to marry {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they are gay Exp_0_Arg2} , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Contrast but Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 that S1 's religion on marriage put into law would not affect marriage for anyone Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg2} .

S1 and S2 are discussing gay marriage in the context of an unknown `` she '' that is pushing a law to ban gay marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 cites a key statement in the same-sex marriage legislation that allows marriage officers the right not {Exp_0_Arg1 to perform a same-sex marriage Exp_0_Arg1} Attr_0} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it conflicts with their conscience , religion , or beliefs Exp_0_Arg2} .

Two people are discussing marriage freedom and religious freedom .

{Attr_0 S1 quotes a provision that states Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that marriage officers do not need to perform a ceremony between same-sex couples Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it conflicts with their conscience , religion or belief Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He states Attr_0} that he would not want someone to be forced to do something against their religious beliefs , {Exp_0_conn_Concession as if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it were the case with his heterosexual civil ceremony , Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_0_Arg1 he would find someone else to do it Exp_0_Arg1} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} states Attr_0} that marriage freedom should n't trump religious freedom . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 believes Attr_0} that all public officials are there to serve all members of the public equally under the law Exp_1_Arg1} , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_conn_Condition {Exp_0_Arg2 if Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 one can not do the job {Exp_1_conn_Condition then Exp_1_conn} he should look for another job Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 said Attr_0} that {Exp_1_Arg1 in South Africa it seems {Exp_0_Arg1 as if marriage freedom does not trump religious freedom Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 public officials do not have to perform a gay marriage ceremony Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Condition if Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 they believe that doing so would be against their values Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He said Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 a public official did not want to marry him in a heterosexual marriage Exp_0_Arg2} he would want to go elsewhere rather than force him to do it Exp_0_Arg1} .

{Attr_0 S2 said Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that public officials should serve the public equally under the law Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that is what they are supposed to do Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He said Attr_0} that they should have {Exp_0_Arg1 to look for another job Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they do not want to do their jobs Exp_0_Arg2} .

He expressed his gladness at being in Canada where there are more rights .

{Attr_0 He believes Attr_0} this is a good caveat , {Attr_1 claiming Attr_1} that forcing officials to perform same-sex marriages would be infringing upon their religious freedom .

{Exp_1_Arg1 S1 notes a provision in law that {Exp_0_Arg1 makes performing marriage ceremonies by sanctioned marriage officers non-mandatory Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony when Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it comes to same sex couples Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 marriage as long as performing said ceremony would conflict with that person 's conscience , religion and belief . Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} that forcing them to do so against their beliefs would infringe on their religious freedom .

{Attr_0 S2 feels Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that it is unfortunate Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that applies to public officials , as they believe that public officials must serve the public in its entirety , equally , under the law Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He or she feels Attr_0} that {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} one can not perform the job , {Exp_0_conn_Condition then Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg1 that person Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_Arg2 should look for another job Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 This person believes Attr_0} that it is an impediment to {Exp_0_Arg1 the public servant performing his or her job Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it 's true Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He argues Attr_0} {Exp_1_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg1 a public official Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_Arg2 had a religious objection to heterosexual marriages , Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_0_conn_Condition then Exp_0_conn} he would not expect that person to perform his marriage and would Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Alternative instead Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 seek out someone who would Exp_1_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} it is inappropriate for public officials to be able to deny services based on their personal religious beliefs .

{Exp_0_conn_Condition If Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they are unable to do their job , Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_0_Arg1 he suggests Exp_0_Arg1} , they should not be able to hold that position .

S1 and S2 are discussing the situation in which a marriage officiant may be requested to perform a gay marriage but have personal religious beliefs against homosexuality or gay marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 defends and respects the personal religious beliefs and notes Attr_0} that the provision they are discussing -LRB- which is either a law or a proposed law -RRB- provides the marriage official with the ability to opt out of {Exp_0_Arg1 performing the ceremony Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it violates his or her religious beliefs Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 finds that offensive , reasoning that Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the person is licensed by the state to perform marriage ceremonies that person should do so for all marriages , not just heterosexual marriages . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 asserts Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that South Africa takes his view , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast while Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S2 claims Canada sides with him Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 and S2 are discussing a seemingly pending law that would permit marriage officials to decline {Exp_0_Arg1 to conduct gay marriages Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they are opposed to them on religious principals Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} it should be a requirement that you serve all customers and gives the example that he could n't refuse to serve a boy scout or Christian that he does n't agree with .

{Attr_0 He goes on to say Attr_0} that taxpayers and employers are the ones providing the paycheck , not God .

{Attr_0 He believes Attr_0} service is a requirement to express the freedom people have .

The issues here appears to stem from an employee citing some religious view to his\/her boss indicating why they can not perform a job duty .

Speaker one does n't think people should pick and choose what they want equal rights on , in this case between religion and other rights issues , that it should be all or nothing .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 Speaker one {Exp_0_conn_Cause therefore Exp_0_conn} believes Attr_0} that speaker two is unfairly discriminating against an employee based off their religious views . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 Speaker two believes Attr_0} that society dictates that you have to be biased at times .

Speaker two continues that if speaker one 's logic holds true , then he\/she should be able to turn away customers based off his\/her own personal religious views .

Two people are discussing equality and natural rights .

{Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 states that discrimination on people for being religious and keeping people from religion infringes on natural rights Exp_1_Arg1} , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_conn_Condition {Exp_0_Arg2 if Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 you are for equality for gays {Exp_1_conn_Condition then Exp_1_conn} you need equality for all Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 finds it acceptable , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast while Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S2 complains about it . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 states Attr_0} that this allows people to do whatever they want and use their religious beliefs as an excuse .

To contradict , {Attr_0 S1 states Attr_0} that only serious religious views are taken into account .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} proposes a scenario where the only person available to perform the gay marriage ceremony is exempted based on religious beliefs , their rights wo n't be upholded . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 rebuts by stating that the proposed provision would allow someone else , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 this is due to religious freedom . Exp_0_Arg2}

Two people are discussing gay marriage .

The discussion revolves around whether or not a clergy person should have the right to refuse to marry a gay couple based on religious beliefs .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 this is alright to do Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony while Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S2 does not agree Exp_0_Arg2} .

S2 provides an example of his\/her managing a restaurant asking if it would be acceptable for him to refuse to serve a boy scout based on the fact they conflict with his\/her religious beliefs .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He\/she {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} believes Attr_0} clergy members should not be permitted to refuse a union due to the fact the tax payers pay the salary of such people . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 feels forcing this issue is the equivalent to forcing a Jewish person to eat pork sandwiches .

{Attr_0 S1 proposes Attr_0} that it is easy for S2 to be unsympathetic because S2 dislikes religion .

{Attr_0 S1 acknowledges Attr_0} that he considers such religious objections to be evil .

{Attr_0 He suggests Attr_0} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the individual licensed to perform a marriage is paid or licensed by the State Exp_0_Arg2} , the individual should reflect the will and choices of the State and Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause therefore Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 perform gay marriages despite his or her personal religious objection to them Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 suspects Attr_0} that the law may result in an effective denial of gay marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} that religious freedom allows for people to not do something , such as serve a gay customer , that they find objective to their religion .

He gives an example that Jewish people should not be forced to work on the Sabbath or eat pork .

{Exp_0_conn_Conjunction {Exp_0_Arg1 Likewise Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 , {Attr_0 he thinks Attr_0} Christians should not be required to serve gay people in a way that violates their religious beliefs . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 : Opposers to gay marriage often jump to conclusions about who can get married - why not cousins , group marriages , children , dogs ?

Two people are discussing gay marriage and its possible consequences .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 contends that our current marriage benefit laws are set up for two adults running a household Exp_0_Arg1} , {Exp_0_conn_Cause so Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 recognizing group marriages is a huge task Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He points out Attr_0} that {Exp_0_Arg2 even Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_0_conn_Concession {Exp_0_Arg1 though Exp_0_conn} its for one man and wife Exp_0_Arg1} , that is not a necessity and would be a much easier task than allowing group marriages .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 He argues Attr_0} that the purpose of what gays are trying to do is to get married , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 a side effect is that people will see it as the scope of marriage being broadened . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_conn_Contrast {Exp_0_Arg1 But Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 , broadening marriage to include polygamy and other types of marriages is a side effect that does n't need to be accepted . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 contends Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that cultural and legal precedent is very real , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that intent is irrelevant Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 This is Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 by seeking gay marriage , the boundaries of what defines marriage is widening to include more than opposite-sex couples Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 because that , gays are broadening marriage , which inevitably leads to broadening in the other areas Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 believes changing the law to outline group marriages would be a tedious task .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} transforming to open ended would open the door for other issues such as children being allowed to marry .

S1 believes those who practice other types of unions are using same sex marriage to open the door for other types of unions to be accepted and recognized as well .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 Polygamous marriage raises legal concerns that are not currently covered in traditional marriage laws , {Exp_0_conn_Instantiation for example Exp_0_conn} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} this is the reason most people do not want to broach the subject of polygamist unions advising the goes is not to broaden marriage .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 feels laws will need to be changed to tailor to same sex marriages Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the same courtesy should be extended to polygamous marriage . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 argues Attr_0} that society can deal with the issue of polygamy without opening the flood gates to include groups such as children , family members , and animals .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 argues Exp_0_Arg1} Attr_0} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the institution of marriage is to be changed to include same sex couples Exp_0_Arg2} , there is no choice but {Exp_1_Arg1 to Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction also Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 face the subject of other types of unions as well Exp_1_Arg2} .

S1 -LRB- Kronos -RRB- and S2 -LRB- Jyoshu -RRB- are discussing the fact that there are other groups besides the gay community who may want marriage equality rights , such as polygamy advocates or 17 year olds .

Jyoshu sees the changes in law that would be required as an attack on social and legal precedent that can get out of control or be difficult to implement .

{Attr_0 Kronos complains Attr_0} that this is a frequent tactic of anti-gay marriage advocates who unfairly claim that gays want to `` make marriage an open ended institution . ''

{Attr_0 Jyoshu notes Attr_0} that whatever the intent , the result is the kind of change the anti-gay advocates warn against .

{Attr_0 Kronos asserts Attr_0} that specific laws could accommodate specific groups .

{Attr_0 {Exp_2_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} argues Attr_0} {Exp_1_Arg1 that the motivation of gays who wish to marry is sincere Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 the same as the motivation behind opposite sex marriages , and {Exp_2_conn_Cause therefore Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 the broadening Exp_2_Arg2} of marriage is a side effect and not the goal Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_2_Arg1}

The goal of gay marriage supporters is to be able to get married - not to broaden marriage .

{Attr_0 Jyoshu says she understands but complains Attr_0} that gay marriage would open the door to further broadening of marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 argues Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that group marriages would not make sense under current marriage laws , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they only account for two individuals in a legal marriage Exp_0_Arg2} .

They state that opponents of homosexual marriage tend to argue that a change to marriage law would make it too open ended .

This person does not believe that to be true , {Attr_0 and argues Attr_0} that homosexuals are not trying to broaden the scope of marriage , but only change the law to be inclusive of themselves .

{Attr_0 They believe Attr_0} that bringing up hypothetical arguments to the contrary is a distraction .

{Attr_0 S2 argues Attr_0} that an effect of homosexuals being allowed to legally marry would lead to even more changes to marriage laws that would include more than simply homosexual relationships .

{Attr_0 This person believes Attr_0} that allowing homosexual marriage is a case {Exp_0_Arg1 that broadens marriage and {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 allowed Exp_0_Arg2} , can open basis for future arguments to broaden the law further Exp_0_Arg1} .

{Attr_0 They firmly believe Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that marriage as an institution is between a heterosexual male and female Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that changing that in any way gives legal grounds to continue changing it Exp_0_Arg2} .

Broadened marriage is a side effect of legal gay marriage .

S2 : Gay marriage supporters want marriage laws changed to accommodate gay marriage .

Broadened marriage could change the current traditional marriage laws .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 Polygamy , {Exp_0_conn_Instantiation for example Exp_0_conn} , would require more marriage laws changed than gay marriage would , as more people are involved . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_conn_Contrast {Exp_0_Arg1 But Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_conn_Condition {Exp_0_Arg2 if Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 enough people wanted legal polygamous marriage Exp_1_Arg2} , the laws would be passed . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1}

{Exp_0_Arg1 Marriage would be broadened Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 gay marriage is made legal , whether that is the goal of gay marriage or not . Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 suggests that a Christian sect known as theomionists are focused only on gaining power , citing Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson as his sources .

{Attr_0 S2 said Attr_0} that he looked upominionist websites on Google but can only find articles about them on websites that promote liberal views .

He challenges S1 to either produce the link to the source of aominionist article that S1 posted or delete the post as a lie .

S1 and S2 are discussingomionists .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 believes there is no such group Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 this has been made up to promote fear of Christianity . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 believes this Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he is unable to locate a viable website or any other information supporting the group 's being real . Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 feels {Exp_0_Arg1 the group is real Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that they are more concerned with the acquisition of power rather than people 's interests Exp_0_Arg2} .

S2 feels these fears are being instilled by `` radical left '' wingers .

{Exp_1_Arg2 {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} advises that earlier , S1 had posted an article related to the group ; {Exp_1_conn_Contrast however Exp_1_conn} , failed {Exp_2_Arg1 to cite the link Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Cause so Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 others could look at the whole thing for themselves Exp_2_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} posting something on the internet does not make it be true .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} there is a group calledomionists that care only about power and not about people .

{Attr_0 S2 claims Attr_0} that he was unable to find any evidence ofomionists practices online except from left wing groups .

{Attr_0 He thinks Attr_0} one can learn about this group by looking at Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson .

S2 was unable to locate any information on the group other than articles by liberals .

{Attr_0 He believes Attr_0} radical leftists created the group as a way of promoting fear of Christians .

{Attr_0 He asks for objective evidence and thinks Attr_0} S1 's lack of evidence proves there is none .

Exp_1_Arg2}

Two people are discussing whether a radical Christian group called theominionists exist .

{Attr_0 S1 states Attr_0} that Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson can confirm their existence , and questions whether they care about people or just about power .

{Attr_0 S2 asserts Attr_0} that the only evidence are from radical left leaning groups , which he believes are making them up to generate fear .

{Attr_0 He states Attr_0} that S1 can not produce one objective or source by theominionists themselves that states their intention .

{Attr_0 {Exp_1_Arg1 He suggests Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that theimionists are not a real religious group , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Alternative {Exp_0_Arg2 rather Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 are a group invented by left wing groups to make people fear Christianity , and further argues that left leaning individuals rely {Exp_2_Arg1 on lying to achieve their goals Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Cause because Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 they are unfamiliar with the truth Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_2_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 He challenges S1 to stop making assertions without evidence , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he states the left wing must lie and cheat {Exp_1_Arg1 to win {Exp_2_Arg1 {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 the truth is foreign to them Exp_1_Arg2} , Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Conjunction and Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 that he can post {Exp_3_Arg1 that they are Satan Worshipers Exp_3_Arg1} {Exp_3_conn_Contrast but Exp_3_conn} {Exp_3_Arg2 that does n't mean it 's true Exp_1_Arg1} Exp_2_Arg2} Exp_3_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} presents an absurd story about people on the political left being Satan worshipers in order to demonstrate how posting information without evidence to back it up does not make it automatically true . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 implies Attr_0} that theominionist as a group is not interested in people 's well-being but want to control people 's lives .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} that theominionists exists .

He cites Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson as sources that refer to theominionists .

He tells S2 to do his homework in verifying the existence of theominionists .

{Attr_0 S2 asserts Attr_0} that theominionists is a fictional group created by radical left-leaning groups to demonize Christianity .

{Attr_0 S1 claims Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the gay community is the cause of the AIs epidemic in the US Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that homosexuals and their advocates attempt to divert attention from this fact by tracing the origin of the disease to Africa Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_1_Arg1 He\/she feels {Exp_0_Arg1 doing Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause so Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 is like saying {Exp_1_conn_Condition if Exp_1_conn} a bus hit a group of people in Africa Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} , {Exp_1_conn_Condition then Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 buses should be banned in New York Exp_1_Arg2} .

Two people are discussing the spread of AIS in the US as part of a discussion on gay marriage in the USA .

S1 states that location is relevant , as the way AIS spread in Africa is different from how it spreads in the US .

{Exp_0_Arg1 He continues to state that AIS spread in the US because of the gay community , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the gay community continually tries to deflect the argument and include Africa in the discussion instead of providing real facts . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 argues Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that bringing up the topic of AIS is solely as a weapon against gays , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that the location of the AIS epidemic is irrelevant to the discussion Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} states Attr_0} that Africa is included in order to refute the opposing logic . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} that those who defend homosexual activity deflect the question of an AIS epidemic in the United States by bringing up statistics for it in Africa .

{Attr_0 They believe Attr_0} that such arguments have no place in an argument about homosexual marriage and are blatant attempts to sidetrack the argument .

{Attr_0 They believe Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that AIS became an epidemic in the United States through the homosexual male community , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that {Exp_1_Arg1 all evidence should be contained and localized in the United States Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Synchrony when Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 arguing a point Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2} .

S2 refutes this by stating that statistics in Africa are brought up to counter arguments that blame the homosexual community for the United States epidemic .

{Attr_0 He believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the existence of AIs in Africa has nothing to do with AIs in the US Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that it should be ignored Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_1_Arg2 {Exp_1_Arg1 They believe Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 one broaches the topic of AIS one Exp_0_Arg2} must {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction also Exp_1_conn} look at it as a whole Exp_0_Arg1} . Exp_1_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 asserts Attr_0} that AIS became an epidemic in the US through the gay community .

He accuses S2 of changing the topic to AIs in Africa to deflect attention from the topic of AIs in the US .

He challenges S2 to refute his assertion with proof .

{Attr_0 S1 said Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that he is not a bigot , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that he is just presenting a fact of how AIs became an epidemic in the US through the gay community Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 asserts Attr_0} that S1 did not present his statistics as a discussion about the progression of AIS in the US .

{Exp_0_conn_Restatement {Exp_0_Arg1 Rather Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 , S1 presented his statistics to justify opposition to gay rights . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 brought out AIs in Africa Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 location is irrelevant in refuting S1 's logic . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 argues Attr_0} that discussing AIs in Africa is relevant to AIs in the US and point out how AIs is used as a justification for those who oppose gay rights .

{Attr_0 {Exp_1_Arg2 {Exp_1_Arg1 He suggests Attr_0} that the statistics regarding AIs in Africa show {Exp_0_Arg1 that it is not simply a homosexual disease Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that AIs should {Exp_1_conn_Cause therefore Exp_1_conn} not be used as a justification to make gay marriage illegal Exp_0_Arg2} . Exp_1_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg2}

S1 feels the topic of AIS in the U.S. being spread by the gay community is avoiding by returning to the argument that AIS originated in Africa .

S1 requests factual proof that his groups ' statements are untrue .

He\/she advises citing feelings or wants is not providing proof but deflecting the topic .

{Attr_0 S2 argues Attr_0} that by blaming the gay community for AIS ' spreading in America , S1 's group is opening the door for the argument that the disease originated elsewhere .

S2 feels the opposing group is using the spread of AIS as a basis for banning gay marriage .

S1 challenges S2 to debate the cause of the spread of AIS in the United States and encourages S2 to attempt to challenge his claims with proof that they are untrue .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} no one knows how AIS came to the US and states that people using dirty needles , those participating in unsafe sex , and {Exp_0_Arg1 those involved in blood transfusions Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous before Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they knew how it was spread Exp_0_Arg2} were the ones that made it a health concern .

He quotes S1 as evidence of his hypocrisy in requesting {Exp_0_Arg1 evidence Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony when Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he offers none Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 and S2 are discussing the onslaught of AIS in the United States .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} the disease was made into a huge health concern as the result of the homosexual community .

{Attr_0 S2 contends Attr_0} no one really knows {Exp_0_Arg1 how AIS originally arrived in the United States Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the fault of the spread lies with the folks {Exp_1_Arg1 who used dirty needles Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Synchrony when Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 taking drugs and people who did n't practice safe sex Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2} .

{Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} cites the practice of untested blood transfusions Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Asynchronous before Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 it was discovered how AIS could be spread . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 argues Attr_0} that S2 has provided no substantial proof to back his\/her arguments in regard to how the disease actually rose to concerning levels in America and asks for a debate between he\/she and S2 .

{Attr_0 S1 said Attr_0} that he continues to `` stand by '' and adhere to his previous post .

He challenged S2 to show proof that this was not the case -LRB- seeming that gays caused AIs to be a major health concern -RRB- and to stop making empty arguments and\/or attacking him .

He impatiently waited for the proofs he wanted .

He accuses S2 of attempting to change the debate and making personal attacks rather than addressing the question at hand .

S2 stated his belief {Exp_0_Arg1 that it remains a mystery about how AIs reached the United States Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that IV drug users who exchanged needles without cleaning them and those who did not practice safe sex and those who gave blood for transfusions before AIS was known about spread the disease Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He said Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that he would not debate S1 Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous until Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S1 starts himself giving the proofs that he requests of others Exp_0_Arg2} .

Two people are discussing the spread of AIS .

{Attr_0 S2 states Attr_0} that no one knows how AIS got to the US .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} states Attr_0} that those who made AIS a major health are the people {Exp_1_Arg1 who did n't clean their needles Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Synchrony while Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 doing drugs , those who do n't practice safe sex , and {Exp_2_Arg1 those giving blood transfusions Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Asynchronous before Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 it was a known form of transmission Exp_1_Arg2} Exp_2_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 rebuts , asking S2 to provide evidence to back up his claim .

{Exp_2_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} quotes a recent post from S1 , stating {Exp_1_Arg1 that any debate will start {Exp_1_conn_Synchrony when Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 S1 owns up to his own requirements Exp_1_Arg2} and defend his statements , to which S1 guaranteers that he can prove his assertions Exp_1_Arg1} , Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Synchrony as long as Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 S2 accepts his challenge to a debate . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_2_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He suggests Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the debate occurs Exp_0_Arg2} , he will prove his assertions true Exp_0_Arg1} .

{Attr_0 S2 claims Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the origin of AIS in the United States is unknown Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that the spread of AIS was caused by unclean needles , unprotected sex , and contaminated blood transfusions Exp_0_Arg2} .

He rejects the requirement that he should provide proof for his claims by citing S1 's failure to do so .

{Exp_0_Arg1 He suggests that once S1 begins to debate appropriately Exp_0_Arg1} , {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he will too Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} that gay people are the ones that made AIS a major health concern in the US and asks for proof to the contrary .

{Attr_0 {Exp_1_Arg1 He thinks Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 is simply giving opinions and not facts Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Synchrony {Exp_0_Arg2 when Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 he quotes him S1 says he is flattered that a quote from him is the best intelligent statement he could come up with Exp_0_Arg2} . Exp_1_Arg2}

He wishes to debate S2 .

{Attr_0 S1 claims Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that AIS was initially spread in the US primarily be homosexuals Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that no one argues with this fact Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_1_Arg2 {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 agrees that gay people were the first victims of AIS and the first so spread it , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the blame partly lies with blood transfusions {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction also Exp_1_conn} . Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 states Attr_0} that allot of medical resources that could be spent curing cancer and other diseases are being wasted because of the promiscuity of the gay community .

S2 refutes this by saying it is a bigoted statement ; as it means the lives of gay people are less important .

To contradict , {Attr_0 S1 states Attr_0} that the statement means {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the US did n't have this many HIV cases Exp_0_Arg2} , the medical resources could have been put elsewhere , not that the infected should be forgotten Exp_0_Arg1} .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} that AIS was initially spread among the United States through the homosexual male community and does not see sufficient evidence to refute these claims .

{Attr_0 They believe Attr_0} that homosexuals are a drain on resources because of this , and places the blame on homosexuals for introducing a new strain of virus that has drawn medical attention away from other pursuits like cancer .

{Attr_0 S2 concedes Attr_0} that the homosexual community was one of the first places {Exp_0_Arg1 AIS began to be spread through the United States , but Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 states that a large number of cases were because of blood transfusions Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 They believe Attr_0} that S1 is bigoted and turns their statement around by pointing out {Exp_0_Arg1 that it seems Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Concession as if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they are making those with AIS unimportant to cure Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S1 claim Attr_0} that he has been unjustly called a bigot for stating as a fact that AIs is initially spread in the US primarily by gays .

He feels that research to combat AIs have consumed an inordinate amount of resources that could have been used to curing cancer and other diseases .

{Attr_0 He believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the resources spent fighting the disease could have been better spent on other diseases such as cancer Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the homosexual minority had not spread AIS to the heterosexual majority with their promiscuous sexual activity Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He asserts Attr_0} that the majority of US population is paying the price for the promiscuity of the gay minority .

{Attr_0 S2 asserts Attr_0} that gays are the first victims of the AIS epidemic and acknowledges that gays are the first people to spread it .

{Attr_0 He argues Attr_0} that casting gays as spreaders of AIs alone drives hate-speech .

An example is Paul Cameron 's statements that call for the extermination of gays .

{Attr_0 He clarifies Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Cause now that Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 AIS does exist Exp_0_Arg2} , he does not advocate ignoring AIS research Exp_0_Arg1} .

S2 agrees that AIS was initially contracted and spread by homosexuals , but claims that its early spread was due to blood transfusions rather than sexual contact .

{Attr_0 He suggests Attr_0} that S1 believes that homosexuals are less important than heterosexuals based on his comment that other diseases are more important to cure than AIS .

S1 wants to see an actual argument supporting AIS was not spread in the United States by homosexuals .

S1 believes had AIS not spread to the point of becoming and epidemic , the United States ' medical research could have been more geared toward curing cancer and other diseases and blames promiscuity .

{Exp_1_Arg1 S2 agrees in the beginning {Exp_0_Arg1 AIS was spread primarily by gay men Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction {Exp_0_Arg2 also Exp_1_conn} that Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_Arg2 blood transfusions played a big part as well an accuses S1 of being in support of Paul Cameron 's 1985 statement advising of the extermination of the homosexual community Exp_0_Arg2} . Exp_1_Arg2}

Based on S1 's argument in regard to medical resources , S2 accuses him\/her of implying the lives of gay men and women are worth less than those of heterosexual Two people are discussing the spread of AIS in the US .

S1 presents the idea that gay marriage has been pervasive in many cultures , including the Romans , Greeks , Celts , and American Indians .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 advises Exp_0_Arg1} Attr_0} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony while Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 homosexual unions were present in history they were not actually thought of as marriages but more of unions for a specific purpose . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He\/she contends Attr_0} that matrimonial unions were between opposite genders , even throughout history .

{Attr_0 S1 concedes Attr_0} that homosexual liaisons were common in other times and cultures but never recognized as actual marriages and were frowned upon .

Two people are discussing gay marriage .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 states that gay marriage is not a new idea , as many societies have historically practiced it Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 in some cases the homosexuals were valued . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} asserts Attr_0} that even in the old testament marriage was not just between one man and one woman ; polygamy was present . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 states Attr_0} that historically marriage has been about different genders .

{Exp_2_Arg1 {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} states that even Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Concession though Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 the societies had homosexual liaisons Exp_1_Arg2} , Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Contrast but Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 they were not regarded as marriage but as unions for a particular purpose .

In some cases they were even frowned upon .

S1 bring sup historical evidence in support that homosexual marriage was conducted in the past , naming the Romans , Celts , Greeks and Native American tribes .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} mentions the existence of other alternative forms of marriage such as polygamy and polyandry . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 They {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} point out Attr_0} that polygamy has been around historically as well , {Attr_1 and argues Attr_1} that marriage has never been a binary union between one man and one woman . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 responds by stating that the evidence provided does not classify these unions as marriage , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 special case scenarios that do not overlap with existing marriage laws in existence . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 They argue Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that marriage has always been considered to be between one man and one woman Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that homosexual liaisons were special cases Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S1 asserts Attr_0} that gay marriage and polygamy are commonplace in ancient Greece , Rome and China .

He listed hyperlinks to the source of his assertion .

{Attr_0 He argues Attr_0} that marriage as a union between one man and one woman is a recent construct as compared to gay marriage .

{Attr_0 S2 asserts Attr_0} that same-sex marriage has never been commonplace .

{Attr_0 He argues Attr_0} that a couple of Buddhist sects allow it .

It was frowned upon in Roman times .

{Attr_0 He claims Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that gay marriage is not a new idea Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 that the idea of marriage being between a man Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 a woman is a recent development Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2} .

The Greeks had homosexual liaisons , some from desire , some for a form of mentoring reasons .

{Exp_0_conn_Contrast {Exp_0_Arg1 But Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 those were neither marriages nor assumed to be so by those societies . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 provides two websites which outline the history of gay marriage in a few different cultures advising homosexuals were held in high regard in some cultures and were thought of as healers and prophets .

S1 cites several cultures who practices gay unions such as Romans and Celts .

S1 advises some cultures still practice polygamy and one in Nigeria even practices polyandry .

{Attr_0 S1 claims Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that it is inappropriate to label disagreement as bigotry , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 that {Exp_1_conn_Contrast while Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 someone might think an argument is bigoted Exp_1_Arg2} , it may be motivated by something other than bigotry Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} .

S2 advises excluding gays from different pieces of society is the same as excluding any other minority and is just simply bigotry .

Two people are arguing gay marriage .

S1 states that resorting to name calling indicates the inability to resort to sound arguments .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} states Attr_0} that the word bigotry is an ugly word , and its ignorant to automatically write off disagreements as `` bigotry '' . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 rebuts by saying {Exp_0_Arg1 that he 's calling it bigotry Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that 's what it is Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} states Attr_0} that {Exp_1_conn_Condition if Exp_1_conn} it were another minority being {Exp_1_Arg2 challenged Exp_1_Arg2} {Exp_1_conn_Condition then Exp_1_conn} it would clearly be bigotry . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1}

{Attr_0 He states Attr_0} whenever gays are involved a group of people always opposes .

S1 refutes that by {Exp_0_Arg1 saying its all about motivation , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 any other minority would try and change traditional marriage Exp_0_Arg2} , they would be met with the same opposition .

{Attr_0 S1 does not believe Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that disagreement is the same as being bigoted , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 that {Exp_1_conn_Condition if Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 someone resorts to name calling in an argument Exp_1_Arg2} it means they no longer have any sound arguments Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} .

{Attr_0 They argue Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that any argument goes back to one 's motivations Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that people do n't often oppose homosexual marriage on the basis of not liking homosexual individuals , but because of their views on marriage Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He argues Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that many people 's opinions are based on their view of marriage , not their dislike of homosexuals , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that they would be against any group wanting to alter the traditional view of marriage Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 They argue Attr_0} that people who base their arguments on how they view marriage would still think that way towards any group that desired to change their definition of marriage .

{Attr_0 S2 disagrees and believes Attr_0} that arguments made against homosexual marriage are based upon a bias against homosexuality as a whole .

{Attr_0 They argue Attr_0} that these peoples ' opinions are definitively against homosexuals in general .

{Attr_0 S1 asserts Attr_0} that those who are against gay marriage are not anti-gay per se , but are against redefining marriage .

{Attr_0 He argues Attr_0} that any minority group who attempts to redefine marriage to include anything beyond a man and a woman will get a similar response from the majority group .

{Exp_0_conn_Cause {Exp_0_Arg1 Hence Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 calling those who oppose gay marriage bigot is inaccurate {Attr_0 S2 asserts Attr_0} that those who oppose gay marriage are not simply attempting to preserve the current definition of marriage as between a man and a woman . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He argues Attr_0} that the opposition to gay marriage is a lack of acceptance of homosexuality or its visible and open displays and representations .

This is an anti-gay bias .

{Exp_0_conn_Cause {Exp_0_Arg1 Hence Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the term bigot is appropriate to those who oppose gay marriage . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 claims Attr_0} that opponents of gay rights are discriminatory and bigoted .

He suggests that if you replaced gays with another minority , then the arguments against them would appear negative -LRB- e.g. , trying to exclude any other minority from getting married would not be acceptable -RRB- .

{Attr_0 He believes Attr_0} that opponents of gay marriage are not protecting traditional marriage , but are discriminating against homosexuals .

S1 believes {Exp_0_Arg1 referring to arguments of disagreement Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 bigotry is done Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 the accuser lacks factual information and believes {Exp_2_Arg1 S2 uses the statement for its effect Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Asynchronous since Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 it is thought of as an ugly word Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2} Exp_2_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S1 advises Attr_0} not all people who are against gay marriage are bigots but feel the way they do due to the way they view marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 argues Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 the issue is not always about excluding gays from different things Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that it boils down to marriage Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 invites the word gay to be replaced with another minority Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the statements made to not appear to be bigoted . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 points out Attr_0} that his heteronormative family represents the norm and suggests that deviation from the norm in the form of homosexual families is perverse .

{Attr_0 He states Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 may believe as wishes even Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it is wrong Exp_0_Arg2} .

S2 questions what is perverse .

He equates the word perverse with diversity .

A deviation for the norm in his opinion is diversity .

{Attr_0 He doubts Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 is against diversity Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause so Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he thinks he simply hates a form of it , gay people Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 He views calling something perverse ad evidence of this hate and does not believe S1 Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony when Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he says that he does n't hate gays he is simply worried about marriage . Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 and S2 are discussing gay relations and the possibility of redefining marriage to include the gay community .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} gay relationships are a perversion of the normal thought of society .

{Attr_0 S2 contends Attr_0} that S1 hates gays and is basically prejudice toward gay people based upon some remarks being made .

Particularly the label of perversion .

{Exp_0_Arg1 He clarifies that he does n't hate gays , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 he simply does n't believe Attr_0} that the definition of marriage should be changed to include homosexual unions . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 contends Attr_0} that S1 is not against all diversity , just gay lifestyle which in S2 's opinion makes him\/her hateful toward gays .

{Attr_0 S1 contends Attr_0} he\/she does not hate gays but does n't feel marriage should be redefined to allow for them to wed.

{Attr_0 S2 feels Attr_0} S1 's objection to gays and the family 's they would make is prejudice .

{Attr_0 S1 contends Attr_0} S2 is wrong in his\/her beliefs .

S1 expressed his opinion {Exp_0_Arg1 that his family and other heterosexual families are the norm Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that homosexual families -LRB- like S2 's -RRB- deviate from the norm Exp_0_Arg2} .

He called such families `` perverse '' .

{Exp_0_conn_Synchrony When Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 this comment resulted in a challenge from S1 Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_0_Arg1 he denied hating gays . Exp_0_Arg1}

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} stated his opinion that that marriage should not be redefined for gay people ... He continued to deny his hate for gays . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 stated his belief that deviations from the norm are diverse .

{Attr_0 He said Attr_0} that he knew that S2 is not against all diversity but seems to be very much against gays .

{Attr_0 He claims Attr_0} that S2 's beliefs do not make him correct .

He bristled against S1 's definition of his family as `` perverse '' and pointed at the use of that word as being illustrative of S1 's hatred of gays .

Two people are discussing diversity and gays .

{Attr_0 S1 contends Attr_0} that his family represents the norm , not a deviation from it .

He calls gays a perversity , then states that he does n't hate gays {Attr_0 but rather believes Attr_0} that marriage should not be redefined for them .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 contradicts , stating gays are a diversity , not a perversion , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that S1 hates gays . Exp_0_Arg2}

He questions how S1 can claim that he does n't hate {Exp_0_Arg1 gays Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony when Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he clearly calls him Exp_0_Arg2} and his family a perversion .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} states Attr_0} {Exp_1_Arg1 that {Exp_1_conn_Concession although Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 he is younger than S1 , he was n't born yesterday , to which S1 replies that he -LRB- S2 -RRB- can believe what he wants Exp_1_Arg2} , no matter how wrong he is Exp_1_Arg1} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 suggests that deviation from the norm is simply a form of diversity and is not necessarily perverse .

He accuses S1 of hating homosexuals .

In response to S1 's claims that he does not hate homosexuals , {Attr_0 S2 points out Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that calling homosexual relationships perverse is clearly a form of hate , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that it is clear from S1 's language that he does in fact hate people who are homosexual Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 thinks he Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 his family represents what is normal . Exp_0_Arg2}

Homosexuality in his opinion is a deviation from the norm and is perverse .

He rejects the idea that he hates gay people and says he simply does n't think we should redefine marriage for them .

{Attr_0 S1 claims Attr_0} that his opposition to gay marriage is based on the belief that it will hurt more people than it helps , not on bigotry .

{Attr_0 S2 concedes Attr_0} that S1 is not labeled as a bigot but supports those who are in a sense bigots or supporters .

Two people are discussing about redefining the meaning of marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 thinks Attr_0} that it is unnecessary to redefine marriage to include gays .

{Attr_0 He states Attr_0} that all of the rights and benefits that married couples have are already granted to gays without the need for redefining .

Redefining only serves to hurt the many people who see marriage as a sacred bond between man and woman .

{Attr_0 S2 thinks Attr_0} that it is necessary to redefine marriage .

If not , the rights and benefits granted to gays will not be guaranteed .

{Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction {Exp_0_Arg1 Also Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 , {Attr_0 he believes Attr_0} that offending someone 's sensibility is not real , measurable damage , {Exp_1_conn_Cause so Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 there is not reason not to redefine marriage , not doing so only appeases faith justified Exp_1_Arg2} hate . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1}

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} that gay marriage will hurt more people {Exp_0_Arg1 than it helps , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that the benefits deserved by homosexuals can be had without redefining marriage Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 They believe Attr_0} that it hurts people who view marriage as a sacred bond between a man and a woman .

{Attr_0 He suggests Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that it would hurt people with a traditional view of marriage as between a man and a woman , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that the benefits of marriage can be gained by homosexuals without redefining marriage Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 They believe Attr_0} that homosexuals are entitled to their rights , but do not need to redefine marriage in order to get them .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 does not believe that offending one group of individuals counts as damage , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they do believe that appeasing faith justified hate does . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_1_Arg1 They do n't believe Exp_1_Arg1} Attr_0} {Exp_1_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 people are interested in giving homosexuals marriage rights under a different name , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction {Exp_0_Arg2 also Exp_1_conn} do n't believe people wish to grant them any rights at all Exp_0_Arg2} . Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 They believe Attr_0} separate rules will be too easy to manipulate .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} that a big ` bunch ' of people cherish the notion that marriage is a sacred bond of union between a man and a woman .

Redefining marriage to include same-sex couples upsets the sensitivities of these people .

{Exp_0_Arg1 This is unnecessary Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it is possible for gay couples to obtain rights similar to married couples without having to redefine marriage . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 asserts Attr_0} that redefining marriage to include same-sex couples does not harm anyone .

{Attr_0 He said Attr_0} that offending the sensibilities of people does not constitute harm .

{Attr_0 He claims Attr_0} that evidence show that the majority of people do not want to grant same-sex couples rights similar to marriage under a separate label .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 argues Attr_0} that gay marriage does not hurt anyone , straight or gay , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 offending proponents of traditional marriage is not a valid argument against it . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_conn_Cause {Exp_0_Arg1 Hence Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 gays have to resort to redefining marriage to secure legal rights under the marriage arrangement . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He believes Attr_0} that preventing gay marriage is simply faith based hate .

{Attr_0 He claims Attr_0} that having separate rules for straight and gay marriage creates the possibility of those rules being different for the two groups , allowing the gay minority to be disenfranchised .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 believes Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous since Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 gay couples qualify for the same benefits Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Synchrony as Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 married heterosexual couples there is no reason to allow for gay marriage advising his\/her agreeing with these points does not make him\/her a bigot Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 feels supporting arguments with logic eliminates the ability to label one as a bigot .

S2 feels not redefining marriage to allow for same sex couples to unite leaves the door open for gay couples to not be given the same rights and benefits as hetero couples .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He\/she believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as long as Exp_0_conn} there is a separate set of standards there can be rule changes to prevent their benefits . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 and S2 are discussing a legislative action associated with a Massachusetts court ruling which is favorable to gay rights .

He sees this as a true conservative opinion to take .

{Attr_0 Speaker one believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 the world changed Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony when Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 Massachusetts legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights regarding homosexuals Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 The speaker {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} believes Attr_0} {Exp_1_Arg1 the world is not as anti-gay Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Synchrony as Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 it used to be Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 Speaker one believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that speaker two is opposed to gay marriage Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 speaker two does not support equal rights for homosexuals Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 Speaker two has opposed gay marriage and likely equal rights for gays in the past , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 opinions that the cause of this opposition is that the speaker believes that government is over-intruding by creating legislature regarding the topic of gay marriage . Exp_0_Arg2}

Speaker two has a very conservative stance in politics and believes government should not be interfering with people 's personal lives .

Two people are discussing gay rights .

{Attr_0 S1 states Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the world changed Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony when Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the Mass. legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights Exp_0_Arg2} .

To him , it means {Exp_0_Arg1 that people are changing against homophobic bigotry Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he contends that S2 hopes that the bigots will overturn equality Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 disagrees with this , stating that the court decision for equal rights is not a big change , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 he only disagrees Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 the legislation is an over-intrusion by the government Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 is enthusiastic about the matter and sees it as a step in the right direction against bigotry , and a recognition {Exp_0_Arg1 that the world is not as anti-gay {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it used to be Exp_0_Arg2} , which S2 is advised to acknowledge and accept Exp_0_Arg1} .

S1 rebuts stating that such a position means S2 favors gay marriage , to which S2 rebuts by stating that he believes that legislation favoring or banning gay marriage are both over-intrusive into people 's lives by the government .

{Exp_0_Arg1 Two people are discussing gay rights and the redefinition of marriage Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it pertains to gay couples . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} the Massachusetts decision to allow for gay couples to marry is proof positive the world as a whole is changing to be more accepting of gay couples .

S2 is defending a statement he\/she made in regard to the possibility that Massachusetts may at some point decide to overturn the decision to allow gay couples to marry .

{Attr_0 S1 feels Attr_0} statements made by S2 indicate he\/she is completely opposed to equal rights for gay couples .

{Attr_0 S2 contends Attr_0} he\/she is against an amendment put in place to ban gay marriage as it would be the government being overly intrusive into the lives of the public .

{Exp_2_Arg1 {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} accuses S2 of being inconsistent in having been on the record on the website opposing gay marriage -LRB- and therefor according to S1 being opposed to equal rights for gays -RRB- Exp_2_Arg1} , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Contrast but Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 now {Exp_2_conn_Conjunction also Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 taking a position that the state should not intervene to ban gay marriage Exp_2_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 defends that position and argues Attr_0} it is based on conservative principles against intrusions into individual lives .

S1 believes the world changed with the legislation in Massachusetts to allow gay marriage .

He assumes that S2 , having stated several times he is against gay marriage , will hope the legislation is overturned but may be out of luck .

{Exp_0_Arg1 He questions Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_2_Arg1 {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S2 's opinion has changed now {Exp_1_Arg1 that gay marriage is in place in Massachusetts Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Condition {Exp_1_Arg2 if Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 he wants it overturned Exp_1_Arg2} Exp_2_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 resents the assumption of S1 and says Attr_0} that legislation to overturn the Massachusetts decision would be an over intrusion by the government .

{Attr_0 He states Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that he would not want an amendment to ban gay marriage Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 that has always been his opinion Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 he does not agree with over intrusion by the government Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2} .

Two people are debating the topic of gay marriage rights .

{Attr_0 He said Attr_0} that he does what he thinks is right {Attr_1 and believes Attr_1} that Jesus is not against polygamy .

{Attr_0 He said too Attr_0} that the pastemocratic presidents left far fewer deficits than the Republican presidents .

S1 claims that legalizing homosexual marriage would eventually lead to the legalization of polygamous marriage , citing a proposed constitutional amendment that bans both gay marriage and polygamy .

{Attr_0 He cites a passage from the Bible where Jesus said Attr_0} a man should be cleaved to his wife .

{Attr_0 He claims Attr_0} that if people on the right wing support a ban on gay marriage , then the left wing must oppose a ban on gay marriage .

S2 cites instances of God supporting polygamy in the Bible .

{Attr_0 He claims Attr_0} that we already practice serial polygamy because of America 's liberal divorce laws .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} points out the logical fallacy in S1 's argument about the left and right wing , stating that one wing supporting something does n't mean the other wing opposes it . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

Two people are discussing gay marriage and law .

{Attr_0 S1 states Attr_0} that gay marriage will ultimately lead to a marriage bill for polygamists .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} allowing gays to marry will open up the door to legalize other types of marriage such as polygamy .

{Attr_0 He states Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 Kingavid had multiple wives under the Old testament , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that divorce laws were granted by Moses because of the hardness of people 's hearts Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_conn_Conjunction {Exp_0_Arg1 In addition Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 , {Attr_0 he states Attr_0} {Exp_1_Arg1 that the left wing are n't against deficits , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause since Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 numerousemocrats want to spend more than Bush Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 states Attr_0} that America already has serial polygamy due to the liberal divorce laws .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 He does n't remember Attr_0} Jesus saying polygamy was wrong , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 even {Exp_1_conn_Concession though Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 he referred to a single wife , basing a whole social convention on one word out of the book Exp_1_Arg2} is absurd Exp_1_Arg1} . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} states Attr_0} that even conservatives criticize Bush 's spending . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 talks about gay marriage leading to polygamy and that 's why the push for the Constitutional Amendment banning gay marriage has a provision banning polygamy .

S1 thinks Kingavid having more than one wife was based on Old Testament law and Jesus believed in having one wife .

{Exp_0_Arg1 He thinks {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} it 's right wing to support a ban on gay marriage\/polygamy Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition then Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it 's left wing to oppose it Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He states Attr_0} someemocrats wanted to spend more than Bush .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 thinks Exp_0_Arg1} Attr_0} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it was okay for Kingavid to have more than one wife it should be fine for him , and brings up that Jews do n't follow the New Testament . Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 holds to the theory that if Kingavid was able to have multiple wives , {Exp_0_Arg1 why then should the common man not be able to , especially Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 religion is to now be the basis for all laws Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He believes Attr_0} anything opposed to one wing must be the other .

He thinks conservatives spend more money .

{Attr_0 S1 contends Attr_0} that practice was of the Old Testament and is no longer considered commonplace .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 feels S1 is too left wing to entertain the thought of allowing gay marriage , but uses religion as the basis {Exp_1_Arg1 even {Exp_0_conn_Concession though Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 there are so many contradictions between the Old Testament Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 what is considered the New Testament Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1}

{Attr_0 {Exp_1_Arg2 {Exp_1_Arg1 S1 stated Attr_0} that the legalization of gay marriage would lead to polygamists getting the right {Exp_0_Arg1 to marry Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause so Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 many laws against gay marriage {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction also Exp_1_conn} outlaw polygamy Exp_0_Arg2} . Exp_1_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} said Attr_0} {Exp_1_Arg1 that the Right Wing was against both gay marriage and polygamy Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Synchrony while Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 the left wing was for it Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} said Attr_0} that manyemocrats were bigger spenders than the Republicans . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 said Attr_0} that it was funny to him that those for less laws on the books and a return to the Old Testament practices including polygamy are now considered left wing .

Two people are discussing gay relationships .

, {Attr_0 he said . Attr_0}

He questioned S2 's labeling of gay people as heterophobes .

He asked S2 what his problem was , why he personally did not want gay marriage .

{Attr_0 S2 quoted a CNN poll which found Attr_0} that many people do not want gay marriage , includingm .

{Attr_0 He said Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony when Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 people are opposed to gay marriage Exp_0_Arg2} they are often called a homophobe Exp_0_Arg1} .

{Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony When Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 a person is opposed to the banning of gay marriage Exp_1_Arg1} , Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_0_Arg1 they must {Exp_1_conn_Cause therefore Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 be a heterophobe Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1}

{Attr_0 He said Attr_0} that he has a right be against gay marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 argues Attr_0} that two men in a monogamous homosexual relationship is more normative than a man in a heterosexual relationship with multiple women , citing fidelity as a normative attribute of relationships in America .

In response to the poll cited by S2 , S1 claims that opinions regarding homosexual marriages extend beyond political party lines .

{Attr_0 S2 cites Attr_0} a Harris Interactive poll from 2003 showing that 62 % of Americans did not think homosexual marriages should be recognized as legal .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 is in favor of these unions Exp_0_Arg1} Attr_0} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony while Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S2 does not support them . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He claims Attr_0} that advocates of homosexual marriage are heterophobes trying to force homosexual marriage onto America .

{Attr_0 He claims Attr_0} that if people have the right to support homosexual marriage , then other people have just as much right to oppose gay marriage due to the freedoms described in the US Constitution .

Two people are discussing gay marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 states Attr_0} that two men in a loving , committed relationship practice fidelity , unlike the man who has one wife for each day of the week .

He questions {Exp_0_Arg1 what S1 's problem with gay marriage is Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 why he opposes it Exp_0_Arg2} .

S2 questions how S1 knows that the man who has 1 wife for each day of the week is n't committed to them and vice versa .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} references polls that state that a majority of Americans and even democrats do not think that marriages between homosexuals should be legal . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} states Attr_0} that heterophobes , who are the people who oppose the banning of gay marriage , want to foist gay marriage upon the rest of America . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 supports gay marriage .

{Attr_0 He states Attr_0} that at least two men in a committed relationship practice fidelity unlike heterosexuals with more than one wife .

S1 compares homosexual relationships to those of men who practice multiple marriage contending homosexuals are more committed to fidelity than those who believe in multiple marriage .

He believes fidelity to be part of the normal American attitude , or at least of Christians .

{Attr_0 He thinks Attr_0} opposition to gay marriage goes beyond party lines and wonders why people are so opposed to it .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} those with more than one wife can still be committed .

He gives the results of a poll in which 59 percent ofemocrats are against gay marriage .

He questions ifemocrats are extreme Christians .

He views those that favor gay marriage as forcing it upon others and believes homosexuals for gay marriage {Exp_0_Arg1 to be heterophobic Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 those against gay marriage are seen as homophobic Exp_0_Arg2} .

S2 begs the question of how anyone can say that a man who believes in and practices multiple marriage does not love all of his wives .

S2 cites a 2003 study advising at that time , 62 % of Americans were not in favor of gay unions .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} the roots are deeper than that particular poll .

S2 feels he has a Constitutional right to be opposed to gay marriage as well as gay people themselves .

{Attr_0 {Exp_1_Arg1 S1 said Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony when Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it comes to the word `` normal '' Exp_0_Arg2} , fidelity should be looked at Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 many gays have fidelity in their relationshipso . Exp_1_Arg2}

Is n't fidelity part of the american attitude of '' normal '' ?

This is about politics and whether or not the lie in order to get more votes .

S1 believes he was lying to attract votes .

S2 expresses desire for a candidate who stands behind their beliefs regardless of popular opinion , and not lie to get votes .

{Attr_0 S1 calls S2 naive for believing Attr_0} that lying does not happen in politics today .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} it is the responsibility of the public to decipher political language to know when politicians are lying or not .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} that the public should demand honesty but not assume it .

{Exp_0_Arg1 There is no point is questioning candidates , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it is known they are going to lie . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 addresses that S1 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} believes {Exp_1_Arg1 that honesty should be demanded Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 their earlier statements insinuated that they thought this practice was wrong Exp_1_Arg2} {Attr_0 -LRB- S1 -RRB- argues Attr_0} that overtime-religious politicians , conservative republicans have made the effort to make gay rights a poison topic . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 According to his democrats want to do the right thing {Exp_0_conn_Contrast however Exp_0_conn} , they are force to moderate their opinions for public approval . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 -LRB- S2 -RRB- says Attr_0} that politicians lie about their opinion to not loose votes .

{Attr_0 He says Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that he would prefer Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 politicians were honest Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 politicians sometimes may lie Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as long as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 its {Exp_1_Arg1 what is the majority , {Exp_1_conn_Contrast while Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 S2 is saying that S2 is more concerned with the honesty of the candidates rather than whether they are lying Exp_1_Arg2} or not Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} .

{Attr_0 -LRB- S1 -RRB- says Attr_0} that it is common knowledge that politicians are going {Exp_0_Arg1 to lie Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they can not simply say things Exp_0_Arg2} , they have to be careful for the judgment of other .

The particular case of Biden who stated that does n't support gay marriage .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} states Attr_0} {Exp_1_Arg1 that it might be Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 Biden did not wanted to risk his support and his position in the White House Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 -LRB- S2 -RRB- argues Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that -LRB- S1 -RRB- is misunderstanding him Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 according to him people need to put expectation for politicians to be more clear and honest about their opinions Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He says Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that people need to pay close attention to politicians and not excuse politicians cynicism Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause so that Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the American people can have politicians to be honest Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 is of the opinion that a certain level of dishonesty is understandable and expected in politics .

{NonExp_0_Arg1 In regard to gay rights , the religious right and conservative republicans have made it a poisoned topic {Exp_0_Arg1 such that politicians wo n't say the right thing Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it will cost them votes Exp_0_Arg2} . NonExp_0_Arg1}
{NonExp_0_Arg2_Cause emocrats have had to be moderate on the issue in order to still be in a position to do something . NonExp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg1 It 's too naive to expect to a politician to give their view on matters Exp_1_Arg1} , {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_conn_Cause so Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg2 it is necessary to figure out how often they lie , {Exp_2_Arg1 what they lie about , Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Conjunction and Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 how big their lies are Exp_1_Arg2} Exp_2_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 In this particular case , {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 Biden says he does n't support gay marriage Exp_0_Arg2} S1 is just as likely to think {Exp_1_Arg1 it 's Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 he knows that open support could cost him the White House as any other reason Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1}

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} that as political consumers we should expect honesty of the politicians .

{Attr_0 S2 says Attr_0} we should expect {Exp_0_Arg1 them to be honest , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that is what we should want from politicians Exp_0_Arg2} .

It is n't too much to demand honesty .

Without that expectation it is pointless in asking a politician a direct question .

{Attr_0 S2 understands Attr_0} that politicians lie but holds that {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg1 words of politicians Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_Arg2 mean nothing Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_0_conn_Condition then Exp_0_conn} there is little point in having political discourse .

Political cynicism is no excuse to not put expectations on our candidates to be honest with the American people .

{Attr_0 S1 says Attr_0} the topic of gay rights has become a poisoned topic because of efforts of religious right and conservative republicans .

It will cost more votes than it will gain .

{Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 questions {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S1 is saying the Biden Exp_0_Arg2} was lying Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Synchrony when Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 he said {Exp_2_Arg1 he does n't support gay marriage Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Cause so Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 he could keep from losing votes Exp_2_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg2}

S2 prefers political candidates to be honest about their views on topics , whether its popular or not .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 believes Attr_0} a candidates view should be accepted that it is really their view Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Attr_1 {Exp_0_Arg2 S1 says Attr_1} that politicians are going to tell some lies and consumers should not take politicians at their word . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} it is important to figure out {Exp_0_Arg1 how often they lie Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 how big their lies are Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S1 argues Attr_0} that politicians seem to lie in order to get the position they want or sway people {Exp_0_Arg1 to become popular , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast while Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S2 thinks that we should rely on them Exp_0_Arg2} to make the right decision .

{Exp_0_Arg1 He gives an example of how Biden says he does n't support gay marriage , it can Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he knows that open support could cost him the White House . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 believes they should put the expectation on them to be honest about what their views are Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 political cynicism is no excuse to not put expectation on their candidates to be honest . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 seems to think Attr_0} that S2 is making an argument for their belief , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S2 is just trying to be honest and show the other perspective . Exp_0_Arg2}

They argue about politicians lying through discussing {Exp_0_Arg1 when politicians are asked questions Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 how they answer them Exp_0_Arg2} .

S2 finishes by telling S1 we should not label politicians and expect them to do and say the right , honest thing .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 begins the dialog by attacking conservative republicans for the lack of gay rights in America , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 claims democrats have been trying to progress gay rights but are afraid to loose their political position . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 responds by commenting Attr_0} thatemocratic Vice President Joe Biden stated he was against gay marriage .

It seems like they are discussing the inconsistency of each other 's arguments .

{Attr_0 S2 does not believe Attr_0} this is an inconsistent statement and attributes Biden 's view to S1 , making it seem like S1 is calling his own view inconsistent .

S1 and S2 begin arguing about the meaning of `` inconsistent '' and eventually starting fighting .

{Exp_0_Arg1 The example of abortion comes up to try and prove inconsistency , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 both use it in different ways Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause so Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 it does not stop the argument Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that S2 should be more concerned with Biden being inconsistent , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast while Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S1 is just trying to address the issue as a whole Exp_0_Arg2} .

S2 claims to only have brought up Biden to address the lack of political action due to social pressures .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 claims Attr_0} that Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 given the opportunity , they would express the same concerns with Biden on a one on one conversation . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 -LRB- S1 -RRB- states Attr_0} that one who supports gay right but not gay marriage brings an inconsistent problem .

{Attr_0 {Exp_1_Arg1 -LRB- S2 -RRB- says Attr_0} that he does {Exp_0_Arg1 not sees any inconsistency , and compares it to the issue of abortion Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 how one can be against such issue for society Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Contrast but Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 for ones position it may be possible . Exp_1_Arg2}

-LRB- S1 -RRB- tells -LRB- S2 -RRB- that it seems like he does not understand the concept of inconsistency .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 -LRB- S1 -RRB- {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} says Attr_0} that he hopes that -LRB- S2 -RRB- did not think of gay marriage to be a right . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 is getting annoyed and seems {Exp_0_Arg1 to just be arguing Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they are `` venting '' Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Synchrony while Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 S2 is saying that the inconsistency is present and making all arguments invalid without proof Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2} .

They keep arguing about positions in the matter and who is inconsistent .

{Attr_0 {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg1 -LRB- S2 -RRB- says Attr_0} that many people often times say things such as `` I do n't believe gay marriage is a right '' Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg2 they {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction also Exp_1_conn} believe that gay people should have equal rights Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He argues Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that Biden 's opinion is consistent Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 Biden is not lying about what he believes Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 -LRB- S1 -RRB- says Attr_0} that he know that there is inconsistency Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he does not care . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 -LRB- S2 -RRB- says Attr_0} that people weight the ay marriage opinion issue against politician 's weeks before elections and balance the responding approach .

{Attr_0 S1 one believes Attr_0} that it is inconsistent to support gay rights but to be against gay marriage .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 does not have a problem with such an inconsistency Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 knowing that S2 supports gay marriage it would make sense that S2 would be bothered by it . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 does n't believe Attr_0} that S2 understands the concept of inconsistency .

{Attr_0 S1 thinks Attr_0} that S2 would be troubled by Biden 's position on gay marriage .

{Exp_0_Arg1 it would be like someone saying they are for reproductive \/ abortion rights , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 yet being against it being legal for women to get an abortion at an abortion clinic . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 Both S1 and S2 are for gay rights , S2 is stating that S1 is n't being consistent and `` admits '' to being inconsistent , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast while Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S1 is saying {Exp_1_Arg1 they do n't care about the inconsistency Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 of the point they are trying to get across Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 does not see an inconsistency in not supporting gay marriage Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 being for gay rights . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 explains Attr_0} that there is not an inconsistency in being against gay marriage , but for gay rights in every other way .

Showing an inconsistency would be like Frank saying he is against abortion rights but has no problem with his wife getting one .

Just saying that Frank is inconsistent on abortion issues is not enough to show what is inconsistent .

S2 is arguing against the position regardless of who is holding it .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 is not bothered by the inconsistency of one supporting gay rights but not gay marriage , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_conn_Condition {Exp_0_Arg2 if Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 one supports gay marriage Exp_1_Arg2} {Exp_1_Arg1 they would be bothered by it Exp_1_Arg1} . Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 does n't see the inconsistency and does n't understand why S1 keeps calling it that .

{Attr_0 He {Exp_0_Arg1 says Attr_0} that S1 has n't shown an inconsistency yet and gives an example of how it is like saying `` Frank is inconsistent on the abortion issue '' , but would be showing inconsistency Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 is Frank said `` I am against all abortion '' Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 does n't know {Exp_0_Arg1 what else to say Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 that it would be different Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Condition if Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 S2 did n't think gay marriage would be a right Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 argues Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that S1s ' position is inconsistent Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that S2 can see a person for gay rights and against gay marriage Exp_0_Arg2} .

They bring up Biden and abortion in ways that dont exactly fit the discussion , but just to show the inconsistency in each others opinions .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 He thinks Attr_0} Biden is wrong Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 his view is consistent . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 says Attr_0} he does n't care about the inconsistency of one supporting gay rights and not gay marriage .

S2 says to push hard on Biden about the `` gay marriage opinion '' a few weeks away from election day and balance the response .

S2 is saying they would handle this same situation with {Exp_0_Arg1 Biden the exact same way Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S2 is simply talking about perspective Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} S2 is stating that S1 believes in gay marriage but not gay rights , which seems contradictory to S1 's point .

This argument does not have a set topic .

In this discussion S1 and S2 are addressing the inconsistencies of the position of being for gay rights , but against gay marriage .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 believes Attr_0} that Biden saying this is inconsistent , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 it should bother S2 Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 S2 is for gay marriage Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2}

This is about the use of arguments of violence towards gay-marriage .

S1 and S2 are talking about the views of gay marriage in our culture .

S1 is against gay marriage but thinks it is unfair for supporters of gay marriage to link his view with violence towards gays .

{Attr_0 S1 thinks Attr_0} violence towards gays is used as launching point for gays to preach gay rights .

S2 makes reference other poster and homophobic slurs that be frequently used on the thread .

S2 believes that violence towards gay stem from slanderous representations of gays , and produces a toxic environment where people will act in violence out of fear .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 is {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous once Exp_0_conn} again gets angered by the generalizations used by S2 , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 it does not represent his point Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 is happy S1 is no loner attacking him .

S1 believes he was only responding to the attacks by S2 .

S2 becomes angry with S1 for avoiding the main topic at hand .

The discussion diverges into S2 quoting previous posters and showing hateful speech .

S1 starts off saying there is a difference between being anti-gay and someone condoning violence against gay people .

S2 believes this dehumanizing talk in responsible for hate against gays .

-LRB- S1 -RRB- is talking about how gay marriage is not synonymous with violence .

{Attr_0 -LRB- S2 -RRB- argues Attr_0} that there is regular denigration of gays and mentions politician 's unhelpful views on gay marriage .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 -LRB- S1 -RRB- {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} says Attr_0} that it 's funny how violence is used to end an argument against religion . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

-LRB- S2 -RRB- is talking about bad things that people make\/talk about gay people to influence fear on others .

{Exp_0_conn_Instantiation {Exp_0_Arg1 For example Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 , that gay marriage means {Exp_1_Arg1 that children will have to know about it , churches to perform gay marriages , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 that the adds on Proposition 8 the adds were insightful Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 -LRB- S1 -RRB- says Attr_0} that there is an anti-gay rhetoric and inflated statements to scare people .

{Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous {Exp_0_Arg1 Then Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 both -LRB- S1 -RRB- and -LRB- S2 -RRB- argue about how they are not so interested in arguing with each other Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Contrast but Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 they are invested in defending their ideals . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 -LRB- S1 -RRB- says Attr_0} NAMECALLING ANVIOLENCE were things commonly use at the same time to oppose gay marriage .

{Attr_0 -LRB- S2 -RRB- states Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that -LRB- S1 -RRB- use boring passive-aggressive attacks Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony when Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 talking about the issue of gay marriage Exp_0_Arg2} .

S2 talks about how violence is used to make people feel threatened to feel a certain way about a topic or debate .

Both -LRB- S1 -RRB- and -LRB- S2 -RRB- keep referring to other 's views on the issue and choose sides .

{Attr_0 S1 points out Attr_0} that the gay marriage debate is not synonymous with someone condoning violence against gays .

{Attr_0 S1 thinks Attr_0} that anyone here would with S2 that gays should n't experience violence and name-calling .

{Attr_0 S1 doubts Attr_0} that anyone would {Exp_0_Arg1 be satisfied Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 every religious person who genuinely disagreed with gay marriage because of their religion added a ' but-no-violence Exp_0_Arg2} ! '

addendum to everytime they weighed in on it .

People should n't have to stop standing up for their principles just because of nutcases out there .

S1 is not trying to ignore S2 and defends not attacking S2 due to the change of tone of S2 .

Namecalling and violence are wrong , REGARLESS of where people fall on the issue of gay marriage .

{Exp_0_conn_Conjunction {Exp_0_Arg1 In fact Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 , more importantly , they 're always wrong no matter what the issue . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 points to another author Archie who regularly denigrates gays with a variety of slurs as someone who uses inflammatory language .

S2 used the example of kids being taught about gay marriage in school as a threat .

There are people who put out junk that makes people feel threatened by gays .

It 's built up toxicity from all the anti-gay rhetoric that reaches a boiling point .

{Exp_0_conn_Synchrony When Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the rhetoric inflames , Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_0_Arg1 it 's obvious {Exp_1_Arg1 where it starts Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Synchrony when Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 somebody gets burned Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1}

{Attr_0 S2 thinks Attr_0} that S1 throws arbitrary arguments out there , belittles the claim of S1 and demonstrates an ulterior motive for ignoring the statement .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 asks S2 Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he knows that the gay marriage debate is not synonymous with someone condoning violence against gays . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 agrees Attr_0} that gays should n't experience violence and name-calling .

{Attr_0 S2 says that on Archie 's post Attr_0} that Archie regularly denigrates gays with a variety of slurs .

S1 finds it funny that the whole violence thing gets used as a means-to-an-end tool by those who argue against religious people on this .

People should n't have to stop standing up for their principles just because of other people .

{Attr_0 S2 says telling people Attr_0} that gay marriage will makes their kids have to be taught about gay marriage is a threat , as well as telling people that gay marriage will require churches to have to perform gay marriages .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} mentions someone named Archie who posts include a variety of slurs towards gay people . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 thinks S1 is ignoring him Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 S1 says Attr_0} he is not rather S2 's tone has changed . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 says Attr_0} name calling and violence were the things Jason conflated with opposing gay marriage .

S2 asks S1 to quote {Exp_0_Arg1 exactly what he said Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he thinks Jason did no such thing Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 brushes on the topic , but goes off track from the topic quite a bit .

These two people start referring to each others `` attacks '' on each other towards the end .

{Attr_0 S1 says Attr_0} they were referring to namecalling and violence from the original post that was opposing gay rights .

{Exp_0_Arg1 These two are n't really in opposite positions\/beliefs , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they are more trying to discuss the ways they argue for or against gay marriage and how it may be portrayed by others . Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 and S2 are debating the topic of what marriage should mean to our government .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} that individual contracts by lawyers rather than the government being involved would be the fairest compromise .

{Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 encountered problems with this view in their personal life Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony when Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 their partner died Exp_0_Arg2} , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 they were unable to sort out all of the legal issues involved in death , like inheritance , or social security rights . Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} there will be privileges that come only in government recognized unions .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 comments best way to go about solving these problems is to take them one issue at a time rather {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} facing the problem as a whole . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 thinks Attr_0} that you need to look at situations in from different perspectives like trees in the woods .

Both S1 and S2 have previous experience with married life and single life .

-LRB- S1 -RRB- Marriage is meaningful and should not be a concern of the government .

{Attr_0 -LRB- S2 -RRB- states Attr_0} that marriage is an ancient human institution , natural for humans and is one of the foundations of social stability .

{Attr_0 -LRB- S2 -RRB- says Attr_0} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg1 that Christians are involved in the topic {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they want the government to `` get out of marriage '' Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause since Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 gay people are becoming involved Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 -LRB- S2 -RRB- says Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that Christians are hypocrites because Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous before Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they had not complained Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S1 Believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 it is not a bad idea Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they think {Exp_1_Arg1 it is not necessary for the government to be involved in most aspects of our lives , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Contrast while Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 S2 is questioning why it 's necessary {Exp_2_Arg1 to try and remove government involvement Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Synchrony when Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 it is unavoidable Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2} Exp_2_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 -LRB- S2 -RRB- states the importance for government to get involved {Exp_0_conn_Contrast however Exp_0_conn} , it is convenient and mentions Mr. WriteLA as someone who has eloquently talked about the topic . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

-LRB- S1 -RRB- government desires to be involved in lives .

Talks about the `` Healthy Marriage Initiative '' and how some mean-spirited hypocrites want the government out for the wrong reasons .

-LRB- S2 -RRB- Questions why is it in societies interest in preventing the government to be involved in marriage .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction {Exp_0_Arg1 Also Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 mentions Mr. WriteLA who said Attr_0} that the government 's involvement is inevitable . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_1_Arg1 -LRB- S1 -RRB- argues Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the government should get out of the marriage business Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it is not needed Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 the benefits of marriage are terribly unfair for single people . Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 -LRB- S2 -RRB- says Attr_0} single people do not have same issues as married people from experience .

S1 Questions the role of government in marriage , {Attr_0 maintaining Attr_0} that it should have a very limited one .

{Attr_0 S1 says Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that governments want to be involved in our lives as much as they can be , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 that getting the government out of marriage getting the government out of marriage would be a good idea even Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Condition if Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 people are supporting this change for the wrong reasons Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 It is not necessary to have government in marriage Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 citizens should be vigilant in making sure that the government does not intrude where it is not needed . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 brings up that Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 several people are against the government due to gay marriage and not {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 it 's just marriage altogether , Exp_1_Arg2} {Exp_1_Arg1 it does n't mean it 's not a bad idea to remove government intervention Exp_1_Arg1} . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} that single people have the biggest stake in this issue .

S2 criticizes the new push for government getting out of marriage .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 talks about marriage being an ancient tradition , based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that is one of the foundations for social stability . Exp_0_Arg2}

It is thought {Exp_0_Arg1 that it would be natural for the government to want to support it Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 that it should Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 the government is the source of law Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 Replacing marriage would mean a plethora of minor and specific legal contracts to cover all the hundreds of rights Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 mutual obligations currently conferred by marriage . Exp_0_Arg2}

Legal issues such as inheritance , pension and social security rights , adoption , custody , and home ownership that would need separate contracts without the umbrella of marriage .

Marriage is more convenient .

S1 and S2 are talking about what marriage means to the government .

{Attr_0 S1 says Attr_0} his marriage has nothing to do with the government .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} that marriage is one of the foundations of social stability .

S1 mentions the `` Healthy Marriage Initiative '' and how it is n't necessary .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 and S2 are both not surprised Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the government gets involved in marriage . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 is upset that Christians are demanding the government to `` get out of marriage '' Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 gay people want to get in it . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 the government does not need to get involved with the regulation and support of marriage Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 why the society should prevent it Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} the government getting out of marriage is not a bad idea .

S1 and S2 start arguing about marriage benefits between single people and married .

{Attr_0 S1 argues Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 government support of marriage is unfair to single people Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S2 argues single people do not have the same issues as married people Exp_0_Arg2} .

They give examples of their own married and single life .

They both compare marriage to marriage to woods and trees .

{Attr_0 {Exp_2_Arg2 {Exp_2_Arg1 S2 says Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that there is too much legal work and documents behind marriage in the government , such as inheritance , pension and social rights , etc. , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 that it would be a lot more work {Exp_1_conn_Condition if Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 the government did n't intervene Exp_1_Arg2} , {Exp_2_conn_Conjunction also Exp_2_conn} stating that removing marriage from government will only benefit lawyers Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} . Exp_2_Arg1} Exp_2_Arg2}

Both S1 and S2 have had experience with marriage , S2 states that marriage benefits are good because of government intervention .

This discussion is about the government roll in marriage , specifically pertaining to homosexual marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} that the government should have no say in marriage .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that government should have a say in marriage Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it is more practical in today 's world Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 : {Exp_0_Arg1 Legally , it is complicated to legalize gay marriage in all states , asOMA is in place Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 states have chosen not to recognize other state 's marriages for decades Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 To contradict this , S2 states that each Justice will vote to side with gay marriage , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 there is a current tradition of one state respecting {Exp_1_Arg1 another 's marriage license Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Asynchronous when Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 it comes to heteros , a tradition {Exp_2_Arg1 that will be kept Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Condition if Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 gay marriage laws are passed Exp_1_Arg2} Exp_2_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_2_Arg2 {Exp_2_Arg1 {Exp_1_Arg1 S1 believes {Exp_0_Arg1 New England and New York will pass gay marriage Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the West Coast will as well Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} ; {Exp_1_conn_Contrast however Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 , {Attr_0 S1 {Exp_2_conn_Conjunction also Exp_2_conn} believes the influx of states to recognize Attr_0} the unions will drop off for as many as 30 years Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_2_Arg1} Exp_2_Arg2}

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} believes Attr_0} the removal ofOMA will not effect the outcome nationally advising each state has a right to pass or not pass in the state as well as the fact one state does not have to recognize another state 's laws ; {Exp_1_Arg1 meaning , just Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 someone is married in New York Exp_1_Arg2} does not mean Pennsylvania would have to recognize that marriage . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 feels Attr_0} courts will rely upon choice of law doctrine for guidance .

S2 does not agree with this information and believes ifOMA is removed gay marriage will be passed nation wide .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} feels the majority of Justices will vote pro gay marriage shouldOMA be removed from the equation . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_conn_Conjunction {Exp_0_Arg1 Also Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 , there is a belief each state will eventually recognize the unions entered into in states which do allow gay marriage . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 and S2 are pondering the future of gay marriage laws in the United States .

S1 posits {Exp_0_Arg1 that States on the East and West Coasts will have gay marriage laws , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that mosts states will be able to prevent them with laws of their own which define marriage as between a man and a woman Exp_0_Arg2} .

S2 is optimistic that the Supreme Court will find State laws that ban {Exp_0_Arg1 gay marriage unconstitutional Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 Congress acts to removeOMA -LRB- efense of Marriage Act -RRB- Exp_0_Arg2} .

Attempts abide by the FFC clause to in respect to marriage -LRB- even beforeOMA -RRB- require such lengthy legal arguments that they are rendered prohibitive .

S1 questions why the Court does n't findOMA unconstitutional , to which S2 asserts it has not had the opportunity to do so yet .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} argues Attr_0} that choice of law rules in the various States will result in gay marriages not being recognized in States where there is no gay marriage , and that States have historically already done so on that basis . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 He further asserts Attr_0} that resort to choice of law rules means that the FFC -LRB- Full Faith and Credit Clause -RRB- of the Constitution is not addressed in this context .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that new England and New York will have gay marriage within the next few years Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that the west coast might come soon after Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 They argue Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that after this time period , gay marriage legislation will stop for the next twenty years or so Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that thirty states already define marriage as between one man and one woman Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 They do not believe Attr_0} that the supreme court would overturn gay marriage bans as unconstitutional and believes that states will ultimately be the ones to recognize whether it should be legal or not .

{Attr_0 They argue Attr_0} that current marriage laws are disputed between states and have been for decades {Attr_1 and believes Attr_1} that the courts will be unable to intervene .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} that a federal recognition of gay marriage will be soon coming , and argues against S1 's claims on the basis of Roberts and Alito being constitutional literalists .

{Attr_0 They believe Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that there is enough support in the Supreme Court to follow the constitution as written Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that it will find any laws prohibiting gay marriage unconstitutional as a result Exp_0_Arg2} .

The choice of law doctrine must be considered andOMA could be found to be unconstitutional by vote of the SCOTUS .

{Exp_0_Arg1 How will states use the choice of law doctrine Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause so that Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the FFC clause does not apply ? Exp_0_Arg2}

{NonExp_0_Arg1 S2 : {Exp_0_Arg1 If Congress removesOMA , a vote for legal gay marriage will pass quickly , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 certain justices of SCOTUS already approve of gay marriage Exp_0_Arg2} . NonExp_0_Arg1}
{NonExp_0_Arg2_Conjunction OMA has yet {Exp_1_Arg1 to be declared unconstitutional Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_2_Arg1 {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 there has yet to be a case made to challengeOMA in the courts , Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Cause so Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 it has not been decided upon by SCOTUS Exp_1_Arg2} Exp_2_Arg2} . NonExp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 The choice of law doctrine trumps the FFC clause in cases of marriage contract Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 there is a current tradition of respecting other states marriage licenses for Two people are discussing gay marriage . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 states Attr_0} that in the next 20 years the wave of gay marriage legalization will be over , to which S2 states {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 Congress removes theefense of Marriage Act Exp_0_Arg2} , the full faith and credit clause is a clear constitutional mandate Exp_0_Arg1} .

{Attr_0 S1 rebuts saying Attr_0} that even without the federalOMA , the choice of law doctrine means that states can choose not to recognize gay marriage , or even be forced to recognize another state 's gay marriage .

{Attr_0 {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} states Attr_0} that the full faith and credit clause has never been used in that way , Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 due to the lengthy legal argument involved it is unlikely to be used . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2}

This debate is about the 9th and how the federal constitution applies to marriage .

The argument originally starts in a tangent of Abortion .

{Attr_0 S2 thinks Attr_0} that S1 is trolling the thread and briefly comment on abortion playing the devil advocate to shows the misuse of logic is S1 's thinking for issues in gay marriage .

S1 continues to antagonize S2 .

S2 continues to discuss the necessity of drawing boundaries in reason and the importance staying on track .

{Attr_0 S2 says Attr_0} they should use familiar comparison of attacks on inter-racial marriage {Exp_0_Arg1 where {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 you are against interracial marriage Exp_0_Arg2} , you are for slavery , to show his support of gay marriage , just to show S1that type of discourse is not logically accurate Exp_0_Arg1} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 brings the `` 9th '' from Maine and `` Prop 8 '' from California as example of states that have showed that their majority was against gay marriage , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 yet people in those states are still trying to get them overturned . Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 compliments S1 for clever banter .

S2 ends the discussion by accusing S1 of repeating his points , which pertain to two separate issues .

-LRB- S1 -RRB- begins talking about the death of a child either by natural or in the hands of a doctor .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 -LRB- S1 -RRB- {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} mentions that there are photos in the web and offers to debate about the topic . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 and S2 begin by talking about trolling and potentially starting a new debate on abortion , which does n't really have a lot of purpose in this conversation .

{Exp_0_Arg1 -LRB- S2 -RRB- questions Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 -LRB- S1 -RRB- is beginning to debate about abortion . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 -LRB- S2 -RRB- {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} indicates playing devils advocate {Exp_1_Arg1 to Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction also Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 talk about gay rights in relation to abortion Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

-LRB- S2 -RRB- compares abortion to the extermination of Jews in the Holocaust .

-LRB- S1 -RRB- bring to -LRB- S2 -RRB- 's attention the overturning of the 9th in Maine 's results .

{Exp_0_Arg1 -LRB- S2 -RRB- {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_0_conn} states that the 9th is {Exp_0_Arg2 about hoe Exp_0_Arg2} the FEERAL CONSTITUTION applies to gay marriage . Exp_0_Arg1}

This means that the results reflect how the voters feel about gay marriage .

{Exp_1_Arg1 -LRB- S2 -RRB- talks about State 's majority has traditionally seen an issue as immoral {Exp_0_Arg1 it is not enough to prohibit the practice Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that intimate relationships are no one else 's concern Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 it is a liberty by due process . Exp_1_Arg2}

-LRB- S1 -RRB- talks about the desire of the voters and so brings up the decision made in California .

To that -LRB- S2 -RRB- says that he can not trust the intellectual honesty discourse of -LRB- S1 -RRB- because of his flawed arguments .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} that dead '' potential '' lives do n't have '' real '' or '' actual '' dead bodies .

{Attr_0 S2 says Attr_0} that in saying people who want to get rid of gay marriage may have wanted to prevent inter-racial and inter religious marriage .

{Exp_0_conn_Synchrony When Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 a pre-birth child dies -LRB- either naturally or by the hands of a ' doctor ' paid to kill it -RRB- , Exp_0_Arg2} {Exp_0_Arg1 ... it has a ' real ' body . Exp_0_Arg1}

S1 states willingness to debate the matter further with S2 .

S1 questions is Maine 's voting results will overturn the 9th amendment .

California 's ban -LRB- being reviewed by the 9th -RRB- is likewise about '' the voters '' and their desired definition .

S1 anticipates the responses of S2 and questions S2 's ability to learn from the debate .

S2 dislikes that S1 brought up abortion rights in the forum and thinks that S1 would lose abortion arguments by the arguments you have raised here .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} that S1 flubbed up stating what you wanted to say trying to argue that the abortionists could have no qualms exterminating Jews in another Holocaust .

It could could just as easily argue that those people who wanted to prevent gay marriage could just as easily want to prevent inter-religious or inter-racial marriage .

{Exp_0_Arg1 They could supposedly just as easily have wanted slavery back , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they 're willing to deny people rights because of their differences . Exp_0_Arg2}

Maine 's results were about how voters feel about gay marriage not about the federal constitution .

{Attr_0 S2 states Attr_0} that Maine 's vote on gay marriage was an opinion on gay marriage , rather than the 9th being how the Federal Constitution applies to gay marriage .

Bowers rationale does not withstand careful analysis .

{Attr_0 In his dissenting opinion in Bowers Justice Stevens concluded Attr_0} that {Exp_0_Arg1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- the fact a State s governing majority has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 -LRB- 2 -RRB- individual decisions concerning the intimacies of {Exp_1_Arg1 physical relationships , even Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Concession when Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 not intended to produce offspring , Exp_1_Arg2} are a form of liberty protected by due process Exp_0_Arg2} .

LAWRENCE V. TEXAS The fact that a majority want a law is not enough to satisfy a constitutional challenge of that law .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 says Exp_0_Arg1} Attr_0} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony when Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 a pre-birth child dies it has a `` real '' body . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 thinks Attr_0} that S1 is trying to get people to talk to him about abortion .

{Attr_0 He tells S1 to couple a `` general welfare '' claim with the research that shows Attr_0} abortion has caused lower crime .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 believes Attr_0} that boundaries do exist Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he could easily argue that those people who wanted to prevent gay marriage could just as easily want to prevent inter-religious or inter-racial marriage . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 poses a question Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 Maine 's results have any bearing on the scotus look at overturning the 9th . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 says Attr_0} Maine 's results were about how voters feel about gay marriage and the `` 9th '' is about how federal constitution applies to gay marriage .

{Attr_0 S2 argues Attr_0} that they are two entirely different issues and the S1 pointing to issue A does not refute issue B. S2 believes it does n't matter how much `` desire '' the voters have , their law still has to be constitutional and meet the requirements of the 14th amendment .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} says Attr_0} that Bowers Justice Stevens does n't have the evidence to withstand his analysis . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 He ends the discussion with S1 Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous until Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S1 can embrace an honestly open discussion on the topic . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 They {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} bring up Lawrence v. Texas and S2 states {Exp_1_Arg1 that even {Exp_1_conn_Concession when Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 majority wants a law Exp_1_Arg2} it is n't enough for the constitution challenge of the law Exp_1_Arg1} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 goes back to saying {Exp_0_Arg1 how S1 's arguments are flawed Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that its too repetitive for this conversation , because S1 has n't disproved anything Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 They go back to talking trash to each other Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they end the conversation . Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 and S2 are in unfriendly argument about gay marriage .

S1 : WashingtonC ' s city council recently legalized gay marriage .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 states that people in support of marriage equality is growing , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 he contends Attr_0} that equality will soon stand on the side of the majority . Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 retorts {Exp_0_Arg1 that gays lose every time gay marriage is put to a vote in a ballot , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that gays need a better PR strategy Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} states Attr_0} {Exp_1_Arg1 that majority of people will support civil unions with the same benefits but not marriage Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 there will be repercussions due to the efforts to give tax money to federal employee 's same sex partners despite theefense of Marriage Act Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

To contradict , {Attr_0 S2 states Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that so far 5 states have passed gay marriage laws , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that gay people pay their taxes just like everyone else Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} states Attr_0} that the gay community is not a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 rebutts by stating that in those 5 states , gay marriage was not put to a ballot , but forced through the court or legislature .

S1 announces the vote to support gay marriage inC and congratulates theistrict .

S1 feels the majority of society does support marriage equality and will vote for it advising five states had already voted for and passed same sex unions .

{Attr_0 S1 advises Attr_0} they would be happy {Exp_0_Arg1 to accept the title Civil Union Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as long as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the same rights were extended which are given to hetero couples Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S1 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} acknowledges the negative image gays have received is part of the reason some will not accept the concept of gay marriage an advises work is needed to change these stereotypes in order to move forward . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

People 's support of gay marriage has been growing steadily in the past ten years , and will soon be the majority opinion .

S2 believes once brought to a public vote , marriage equality will not be passed and believes a majority of people would support civil unions but not marriage of same sex couples due to insurance benefits and other benefits afforded to married couples .

{Exp_0_Arg1 He\/she does not support the argument of five states having voted on gay marriage but Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Alternative instead Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 believes these were passed without a ballot vote . Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 agrees .

S1 has posted news of theC Council voting to authorize gay marriage and is celebratory about it .

{Attr_0 S2 -LRB- JP -RRB- asserts Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the politicians will pay a price Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg2 that the matter will be overturned Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Synchrony when Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 it is put to a vote Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 He argues Attr_0} that a majority of people , including himself , would support laws providing rights and benefits for gays who elect to enter into civil unions , but not gay marriage .

{Attr_0 He asserts Attr_0} no electorate would vote for gay marriage .

{Attr_0 S1 refutes the suggestion by noting Attr_0} that 5 States had already approved gay marriage .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 He {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} notes Attr_0} that gay marriage laws would not force heterosexuals to enter into them or attend gay weddings . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 seemingly corrects S1 by noting that the States in question had not put the issue to the general public for a vote .

Five states have already legalized gay marriage .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 states that he would be happy with civil union laws , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 each of them agree {Exp_1_Arg1 that the gay community has a PR problem Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Conjunction and Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 that many homosexuals are actually boring and inconspicuous Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} {Exp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Cause since Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 support for marriage equality is growing Exp_0_Arg2} , it is only a matter of time Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Asynchronous before Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 the majority votes in its favor Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_1_Arg2} .

This person uses theC council votes as evidence to support this as well as the fact that five states have passed gay marriage legislation .

They state {Exp_0_Arg1 that any step towards viewing homosexuals as normal people is a good thing , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that even viewing civil unions in a positive light would and could be enough Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 does not believe Attr_0} that marriage equality is something that the majority of the voters wish to see enacted .

{Attr_0 This person argue Attr_0} that any legislation put into motion has been pushed around the voters , and never accounted for on an actual ballot .

They refute S1 's argument that five states have passed gay marriage legislation on the grounds that it was not done via the voters , and never actually put on a ballot .

{Attr_0 They argue Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that {Exp_0_conn_Condition if Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 homosexuals were willing to simply accept civil unions that are equivalent to marriage Exp_0_Arg2} , they might find stronger grounds for legal acceptance Exp_0_Arg1} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 Those opposed to gay marriage may view gays as promiscuous and sexual deviants , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 most gay men are assuredly quite normal . Exp_0_Arg2}

Civil unions will not be accepted in place of marriage , as they do not allow the same legal rights as marriage .

S2 : {Exp_0_Arg1 Councils and legislatures may vote in favor of gay marriage , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it has yet to be the majority vote of the people Exp_0_Arg2} .

Gay marriage {Exp_0_Arg1 should be played in a positive light by its supporters , {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 the current public perception of gay men is that they are promiscuous Exp_0_Arg2} and lead a `` gay lifestyle '' that is offensive Exp_0_Arg1} .

{Exp_0_Arg1 Anti-gay marriage supporters will support civil unions in lieu of gay marriage , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 homosexuals should be satisfied with that . Exp_0_Arg2}

Two people are discussing gay marriage .

S1 and S2 are debating the issue of freedom of speech and gay rights .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 served in the military Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they believed they have earned their right to have freedom of speech . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 points out Attr_0} that gays should be able to do the same but are unable to due to prejudice due to policies that keep gay people from being open about their sexuality .

{Attr_0 S2 explains to S1 Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that the right to freedom of speech is guaranteed by the Constitution Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 gay are not being protected Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_1_Arg1 S1 is fine with gay {Exp_0_Arg1 serving in the military Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony as long as Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they stay in closet Exp_0_Arg2} Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Alternative or Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 they should be kicked out . Exp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 argues Attr_0} that it is unfair to have laws based on religious text that does serve as everyone 's religious text .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S1 responds angrily and with homosexual slurs , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 requests that S2 take his comments up with Obama . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 explains Attr_0} his goal is too preach to the public and not to any specific person {Attr_1 . Attr_1}

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} S2 is being prejudice against religious-minded people .

{Attr_0 -LRB- S1 -RRB- states Attr_0} that he has served Uncle Sam and fought for his freedom rights .

{Attr_0 -LRB- S2 -RRB- responds Attr_0} that -LRB- S1 -RRB- does not {Attr_1 thinks Attr_1} that gay people should have the opportunity to serve in the military or have freedom of speech .

S1 is against gay rights and believes they earned their freedom of speech through serving in the military .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 -LRB- S2 -RRB- {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} stated Attr_0} {Exp_1_Arg1 that -LRB- S1 -RRB- did not fight for his freedom of speech Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Cause because Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 that right is guaranteed in the constitution Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

-LRB- S1 -RRB- accuses -LRB- S2 -RRB- about lying about what other have said .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg1 He says Attr_0} that gays can serve Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they need to stay in the closet . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 -LRB- S2 -RRB- challenges -LRB- S1 -RRB- to show him where he lied and states that gays can not say whatever they want to {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they 'll get Exp_0_Arg2} kicked out and says that is not freedom of speech . Exp_0_Arg1}

-LRB- S1 -RRB- charges -LRB- S2 -RRB- of being in denial but -LRB- S2 -RRB- defends himself by saying {Exp_0_Arg1 that he never said he was in denial Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that the religious book is only a philosophical fiction Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 -LRB- S2 -RRB- says Attr_0} that his fight is not directly or only with -LRB- S1 -RRB- but with others who think that they can tell people how they need to live their lives based on religious beliefs .

S1 differentiates himself from others around here who live off the service of others by saying that he has served for Uncle Sam and fought for freedom of speech .

Sodom and Gomorrah liberals are a scourge to decent people everywhere .

{Exp_0_Arg1 Gay people can serve and say whatever they want , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they need to stay in the closet or else they 're out of here . Exp_0_Arg2}

There 's consequences on earth and in the hereafter for the stiff-necked crowd .

{Attr_0 S2 believes Attr_0} everyone has the freedom of speech and is against speaking out towards other kinds of people .

{Attr_0 S1 believes Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 's position is stupid Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that S2 is in denial Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 {NonExp_0_Arg1 S1 does n't believe Attr_0} that a New Testament person , place , or event should be considered to be fiction . NonExp_0_Arg1}
{Attr_1 {NonExp_0_Arg2_Conjunction S1 thinks Attr_1} that the personal bigotry of S2 is getting the better of S2 . NonExp_0_Arg2}

S2 finds it amusing that S1 believes {Exp_0_Arg1 that he fought for the right of free speech Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that S1 does not believe that gay people should have it Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Attr_0 S2 points out Attr_0} that free speech is inherently protected through the constitution .

{Attr_0 {NonExp_0_Arg1 S2 finds Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that gay people under S1 's view do not have freedom of speech Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_1_conn_Condition {Exp_0_Arg2 if Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg1 gay people Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_Arg2 say the wrong thing Exp_1_Arg2} {Exp_1_conn_Condition then Exp_1_conn} they get kicked out Exp_0_Arg2} . NonExp_0_Arg1}
{NonExp_0_Arg2_Conjunction The constitution applies to all Americans , even the gays . NonExp_0_Arg2}

{Exp_0_Arg1 Not everyone believes S1 's religious book , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 as such , not everyone feels obligated to abide by that book . Exp_0_Arg2}

Thankfully , you and your like-minded crowd of bigots are a dying breed .

S2 's fight is not against S1 specifically , but against bigots who feel that they can use their personal religious beliefs to dictate what others may or may not do .

{Attr_0 S1 says Attr_0} he served Uncle Sam and fought for his freedom of speech right unlike other people .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 is amused at S1 's statement Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast yet Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 he does n't feel gays should be able to serve in the military of have freedom of speech . Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 is very rude and constantly being immature towards S2 .

{Attr_0 {Exp_0_Arg2 {Exp_0_Arg1 S2 {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction also Exp_0_conn} says Attr_0} S1 did n't actually fight for his freedom of speech but was guaranteed it by the constitution which applies to all Americans including gays . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S2 questions S1 to {Exp_0_Arg1 why there should be consequences on earth Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Cause because Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S1 believes it is wrong according to his religious book Exp_0_Arg2} .

S2 tells S1 that he has no evidence of what he claims but asks S2 why all Americans should believe S1 's book .

{Attr_0 S2 says Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 the power of the government comes from the people Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 his fight is again bigots who feels that they can use their personal beliefs to dictate what other may or may not do Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 questions S2 as to who is he to decide what religious-minded people can and can not do {Attr_0 and says Attr_0} S2 's personal bigotry is getting to him .

{Exp_0_Arg1 S2 states that we are granted freedom of speech by the constitution , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S1 responds with immature remarks and questions . Exp_0_Arg2}

{Attr_0 S2 points out Attr_0} {Exp_0_Arg1 that S1 has no evidence of any sort for his arguments Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Conjunction and Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 that believing in the bible should not be a reason to dictate everyone else 's rights Exp_0_Arg2} .

{Exp_0_conn_Conjunction {Exp_0_Arg1 Also Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 , {Attr_0 S2 adds Attr_0} that he does n't need to prove his beliefs the same way S1 should n't dictate his beliefs . Exp_0_Arg1} Exp_0_Arg2}

S1 seems {Exp_0_Arg1 to be ignorant to the actual context of the conversation Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Synchrony while Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 S2 is in belief that S1 should n't use his beliefs to dictate the rights of other individuals Exp_0_Arg2} .

S1 and S2 enter a discussion on gay rights and religion impact of legislation .
